{"title": "The Decay Process of an α-configuration Sunspot", "abstract": "The decay of sunspot plays a key role in magnetic flux transportation in solar active regions (ARs). To better understand the physical mechanism of the entire decay process of a sunspot, an {\\alpha}-configuration sunspot in AR NOAA 12411 was studied. Based on the continuum intensity images and vector magnetic field data with stray light correction from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, the area, vector magnetic field and magnetic flux in the umbra and penumbra are calculated with time, respectively. Our main results are as follows: (1) The decay curves of the sunspot area in its umbra, penumbra, and whole sunspot take the appearance of Gaussian profiles. The area decay rates of the umbra, penumbra and whole sunspot are -1.56 MSH/day, -12.61 MSH/day and -14.04 MSH/day, respectively; (2) With the decay of the sunspot, the total magnetic field strength and the vertical component of the penumbra increase, and the magnetic field of the penumbra becomes more vertical. Meanwhile, the total magnetic field strength and vertical magnetic field strength for the umbra decrease, and the inclination angle changes slightly with an average value of about 20°; (3) The magnetic flux decay curves of the sunspot in its umbra, penumbra, and whole sunspot exhibit quadratic patterns, their magnetic flux decay rates of the umbra, penumbra and whole sunspot are -9.84 * 10^19 Mx/day, -1.59 * 10^20 Mx/day and -2.60 * 10^20 Mx/day , respectively. The observation suggests that the penumbra may be transformed into the umbra, resulting in the increase of the average vertical magnetic field strength and the reduction of the inclination angle in the penumbra during the decay of the sunspot.", "authors": "Yang Peng, Zhi-Ke Xue, Xiao-Li Yan, Aimee A.

{"title": "Improved Weak Lensing Photometric Redshift Calibration via StratLearn and Hierarchical Modeling", "abstract": "Discrepancies between cosmological parameter estimates from cosmic shear surveys and from recent Planck cosmic microwave background measurements challenge the ability of the highly successful $\\Lambda$CDM model to describe the nature of the Universe. To rule out systematic biases in cosmic shear survey analyses, accurate redshift calibration within tomographic bins is key. In this paper, we improve photo-$z$ calibration via Bayesian hierarchical modeling of full galaxy photo-$z$ conditional densities, by employing $\\textit{StratLearn}$, a recently developed statistical methodology, which accounts for systematic differences in the distribution of the spectroscopic training/source set and the photometric target set. Using realistic simulations that were designed to resemble the KiDS+VIKING-450 dataset, we show that $\\textit{StratLearn}$-estimated conditional densities improve the galaxy tomographic bin assignment, and that our $\\textit{StratLearn}$-Bayesian framework leads to nearly unbiased estimates of the target population means. This leads to a factor of $\\sim 2$ improvement upon the previously best photo-$z$ calibration method. Our approach delivers a maximum bias per tomographic bin of $\\Delta \\langle z \\rangle = 0.0095 \\pm 0.0089$, with an average absolute bias of $0.0052 \\pm 0.0067$ across the five tomographic bins.", "authors": "Maximilian Autenrieth, Angus H.

The sharp transition in a system with a strong disorder is very rare, if not non-existent, in the theory of phase transition in systems of short-range pairwise exchange interactions. To understand this remarkable property, we introduce a model including a multispin (cluster-like) interaction between Mn ions, in addition to the usual pairwise exchange terms between these ions and the Mn-Pr interactions. We carry out Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Due to the doping, Mn$^{4+}$ with $S=3/2$ has the concentration of Pr$^{3+}$ ($S=1$) and Mn$^{3+}$ with $S=2$ has the Sr concentration. After attempts with different spin models and various Hamiltonians, we find that the many-state Ising spin model reproduces most of the experimental results. For the Hamiltonian, we find that pairwise interactions alone between ions cannot reproduce the sharp transition and the magnetization below $T_C$. We have to include a multispin interaction as said above. We fit the MC results with experimental data, and we estimate values of various exchange interactions in the system. These values are found to be in the range of those found in perovskite manganite compounts. We also study the applied-field effect on the magnetization in the temperature region below and above the transition temperature $T_C$. We calculate the magnetic entropy change $|\\Delta S_m|$ and the Relative Cooling Power, for magnetic field from 1 to 3 Tesla.

To understand these striking properties, we elaborate in this paper a model and use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to study it for comparison. For the model, we take into account nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions between magnetic ions Mn$^{3+}$($S=2$) and Mn$^{4+}$($S=3/2$) and the interactions between these Mn ions with the magnetic Pr ions. The crystal is a body-centered tetragonal lattice where the corner sites are occupied by Mn ions and the center sites by Pr and Sr ions in their respective concentrations given in the compound formula. We use an Ising-like spin model. We show that pairwise interactions between ions cannot reproduce the large plateau of the magnetization experimentally observed below the phase-transition temperature. By introducing for the first time a many-spin interaction between Mn ions, we obtain an excellent agreement with experiments. Fitting the experimental Curie temperature $T_C$ with the MC transition temperature, we estimate the value of the effective exchange interaction in the system. From this value, we estimate various exchange interactions between ions: the dominant one is that between Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ which is at the origin of the ferromagnetic ordering below $T_C$.

The protocluster sample was selected from galaxy overdensities in a $Spitzer$/IRAC colour-selected sample using criteria that were optimised for protocluster purity using a realistic lightcone.

We provide photometric redshift estimates for 47 candidates which exhibit strong peaks in the photo-$z$ distribution of their candidate members. However, the lack of a photo-$z$ peak does not mean a candidate is not genuine, since we find a stacked X-ray signal of similar significance from both the candidates that exhibit photo-$z$ peaks and those that do not.

{"title": "Exchange-correlation entropy from the generalized thermal adiabatic connection", "abstract": "Warm dense matter is a highly energetic phase characterized by strong correlations, thermal effects, and quantum mechanical electrons. Thermal density functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging phase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the exchange-correlation free energy. Approaches using the adiabatic connection formula are well known at zero temperature and have been recently leveraged at non-zero temperatures as well. In this work, a generalized thermal adiabatic connection (GTAC) formula is proposed, introducing a fictitious temperature parameter. This allows extraction of the exchange-correlation entropy $S_{xc}$ using simulated interaction strength scaling. This procedure, in turn, provides an avenue for approximating the exchange-correlation entropy in a way that preserves consistency with a chosen ground-state approximation. In addition, analysis of $S_{xc}$ as a function of interaction strength suggests new forms for approximations and GTAC itself offers a new framework for exploring both the exact and approximate interplay of temperature, density, and interaction strength across a wide range of conditions.", "authors": "Brittany P.

While low-symmetry and complex structure help to achieve low thermal conductivity, the TE power factor and hence the figure of merit (ZT) remains low which hinders to promote these class of materials for future TE applications. Here, we investigated the TE properties of a new system, Cu$_2$ZnSiTe$_4$, with improved electronic transport using first-principles calculation. The presence of heavy chalcogen like Te, helps to achieve a relatively low bandgap (0.58 eV). This, together with unique electronic band topology, leads to a promising value of power-factor of 3.95(n-type) and 3.06(p-type) mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at 900 K. Te atoms also play a crucial role in mixing the optical and acoustic phonon branches which, in turn, are responsible for reduced lattice thermal conductivity ($\\sim$0.7 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at high temperature). Though the thermal conductivity is not appreciably low, the electronic transport properties (power factor) are quite favorable to yield promising TE figure of merit (ZT $\\sim$2.67 (n-type) and $\\sim$2.11 (p-type) at 900 K).

{"title": "Self-supporting Structure of Bird Nests", "abstract": "The mystery behind the bird nest's construction is not well understood. Our study focuses on the stability of a self-supporting nest-like structure. Firstly, we derived a stable/unstable phase boundary for the structure at the fixed coefficient of friction with varying geometrical parameters through force analysis. Structures with a lower height and greater friction coefficient between rods are more stable. The theoretical phase boundary matched the experiment results well. Then we investigate the nest structure's stability under applied weight. Static structures with lower height and more rods (five>four>three) are more stable. Our theory also predicts a transition from plastic phase to elastic phase. These theoretical predictions are all confirmed by experiment. In the experiment, we also find that wet rod structures are more stable than dry ones. The structures can support up to 100 times of it's weight. Finally, we test the nest structure's stability under vibration. When there are no weights applied, we are able to identify the appropriate geometric configuration that can withstand the greatest vibration ($1g$ of vibration acceleration and vibration energy up to $4\\times10^{-4}$ times of a rod's maximum potential energy). The critical vibration energy and acceleration depend on the applied weights. They are increased by two and one order of magnitude respectively under proper weight.

An analysis of the mutual influence between the platform and the kite dynamics, with different wave regimes, reveals a rather small sensitivity of the flight pattern to the platform oscillations; on the other hand, the frequency of tether force oscillations can be close to the platform resonance peaks, resulting in possible increased fatigue loads and damage of the floating and submerged components.

Within a semiclassical approach, we show that the interplay between ionic and covalent bonds favors the formation of pentagonal NWs.

The disclination and twin boundary cause the electronic states originating from the NW core region to generate a conducting band connecting the valence and conduction bands, creating a symmetry-enforced metallic phase. The metallic core band has opposite slopes in the cases of Sn and Te twin boundary, while the bands from the shell are insulating.

{"title": "Stability of Hydrides in Sub-Neptune Exoplanets with Thick Hydrogen-Rich Atmospheres", "abstract": "Many sub-Neptune exoplanets have been believed to be composed of a thick hydrogen-dominated atmosphere and a high-temperature heavier-element-dominant core. From an assumption that there is no chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicates/metals at the atmosphere-interior boundary, the cores of sub-Neptunes have been modeled with molten silicates and metals (magma) in previous studies. In large sub-Neptunes, pressure at the atmosphere-magma boundary can reach tens of gigapascals where hydrogen is a dense liquid. A recent experiment showed that hydrogen can induce the reduction of Fe$^{2+}$ in (Mg,Fe)O to Fe$^0$ metal at the pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the atmosphere-interior boundary. However, it is unclear if Mg, one of the abundant heavy elements in the planetary interiors, remains oxidized or can be reduced by H. Our experiments in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell found that heating of MgO + Fe to 3500-4900 K (close to or above their melting temperatures) in a H medium leads to the formation of Mg$_2$FeH$_6$ and H$_2$O at 8-13 GPa. At 26-29 GPa, the behavior of the system changes, and Mg-H in an H fluid and H$_2$O were detected with separate FeH$_x$. The observations indicate the dissociation of the Mg-O bond by H and subsequent production of hydride and water. Therefore, the atmosphere-magma interaction can lead to a fundamentally different mineralogy for sub-Neptune exoplanets compared with rocky planets. The change in the chemical reaction at the higher pressures can also affect the size demographics (i.e., \"radius cliff\") and the atmosphere chemistry of sub-Neptune exoplanets.", "authors": "Taehyun Kim, Xuehui Wei, Stella Chariton, Vitali B.

Because the model was published early during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, it relied on several assumptions regarding the magnitude of the observed economic shocks, for which more accurate data have become available in the meantime. We refined the propagated shocks to align with observed data collected during the pandemic and calibrated some less well-informed parameters using 115 economic time series. The refined model effectively captures the evolution of GDP, revenue, and employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium at both individual economic activity and aggregate levels. However, the reduction in business-to-business demand is overestimated, revealing structural shortcomings in accounting for businesses' motivations to sustain trade despite the pandemic's induced shocks. We confirm that the relaxation of the stringent Leontief production function by a survey on the criticality of inputs significantly improved the model's accuracy. However, despite a large dataset, distinguishing between varying degrees of relaxation proved challenging.

The rising reliance on interconnected systems and communication networks, on the other hand, exposes these controllers to potential cyber-attacks, which may compromise their safety and functionality. This thesis aims to improve the security of distributed vehicle platoon controllers by investigating attack scenarios and assessing their influence on system performance. Various attack techniques, including man-in-the-middle (MITM) and false data injection (FDI), are simulated using Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the platoon controller. Countermeasures are offered and tested, that includes attack analysis and reinforced communication protocols using Machine Learning techniques for detection.

However, certain difficulties arise when considering tanks in microgravity environments. Surface tension effects lead to fluid wetting of the interior surface of the tank, leaving large interior voids, while thrust/settling effects can lead to dispersed two-phase mixtures. With the exception of Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT), few sensing technologies are well suited for measuring annular, stratified, and dispersed fluid configurations as well as handling the additional complications of mechanical installation inside a spherical tank.

{"title": "ReACT: Reinforcement Learning for Controller Parametrization using B-Spline Geometries", "abstract": "Robust and performant controllers are essential for industrial applications. However, deriving controller parameters for complex and nonlinear systems is challenging and time-consuming. To facilitate automatic controller parametrization, this work presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with N-dimensional B-spline geometries (BSGs). We focus on the control of parameter-variant systems, a class of systems with complex behavior which depends on the operating conditions. For this system class, gain-scheduling control structures are widely used in applications across industries due to well-known design principles. Facilitating the expensive controller parametrization task regarding these control structures, we deploy an DRL agent. Based on control system observations, the agent autonomously decides how to adapt the controller parameters. We make the adaptation process more efficient by introducing BSGs to map the controller parameters which may depend on numerous operating conditions. To preprocess time-series data and extract a fixed-length feature vector, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Furthermore, this work contributes actor regularizations that are relevant to real-world environments which differ from training. Accordingly, we apply dropout layer normalization to the actor and critic networks of the truncated quantile critic (TQC) algorithm. To show our approach's working principle and effectiveness, we train and evaluate the DRL agent on the parametrization task of an industrial control structure with parameter lookup tables.", "authors": "Thomas Rudolf, Daniel Flögel, Tobias Schürmann, Simon Süß, Stefan Schwab, Sören Hohmann", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

We use first-principles calculations combined with the maximally localized Wannier function tight binding Hamiltonian (MLWF-TB) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism to investigate quasiparticle effects of 2D and quasi-1D blue and black phosphorene nanoribbons. Our electronic structure calculations shows that both blue and black monolayered phases are semiconductors. On the other hand black phosphorene zigzag nanoribbons are metallic. Similar behavior is found for very thin blue phosphorene zig-zag and armchair nanoribbon. As a general behavior, the exciton binding energy decreases as the ribbon width increases, which highlights the importance of quantum confinement effects. The solution of the BSE shows that the blue phosphorene monolayer has an exciton binding energy four times higher than that of the black phosphorene counterpart. Furthermore, both monolayers show a different linear optical response with respect to light polarization, as black phosphorene is highly anisotropic. We find a similar, but less pronounced, optical anisotropy for blue phosphorene monolayer, caused exclusively by the quasi-particle effects. Finally, we show that some of the investigated nanoribbons show a spin-triplet excitonic insulator behavior, thus revealing exciting features of these nanoribbons and therefore provides important advances in the understanding of quasi-one dimensional phosphorus-based materials.", "authors": "A.

{"title": "Optimization-based Framework for Selecting Under-frequency Load Shedding Parameters", "abstract": "High penetration of renewable resources results in a power system with lower inertia and higher frequency sensitivity to power imbalances. Such systems are becoming increasingly susceptible to frequency collapse during extreme disturbances. Under-Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) is a last-resort protection scheme and acts as an emergency brake by shedding load to arrest frequency decline. Current and emerging efforts to optimize UFLS settings and frequency thresholds are mostly network agnostic, ignoring network spatial information. With the prevalence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the high-renewable paradigm, the power grid is becoming more bidirectional, making some locations in the network less effective for UFLS action than others. This work proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Program that optimizes the UFLS setpoints (prioritizing one location over another) to minimize frequency deviation and load-shed for a given disturbance. The formulation considers system information and DER generation mix at different network locations, increasing model fidelity. The formulation also captures the discrete nature and practical time delays and deadbands associated with UFLS using a minimal set of binary variables, reducing problem complexity. We empirically validate the optimization approach on the dynamic IEEE 39-bus system for performance metrics, including frequency nadir, steady-state frequency and total load shed.", "authors": "Waheed Owonikoko, Mazen Elsaadany, Amritanshu Pandey, Mads R.Almassalkhi", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

Noteworthy challenges associated with MPC include the substantial computational burden and the inherent difficulty in ensuring system stability. Recently, a rapid computation technique has been introduced as a potential solution. This method guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing the primal-dual gradient (PDG) dynamics as a controller. Furthermore, stability assurances grounded in dissipativity theory have been established. However, these assurances are applicable solely to continuous-time feedback systems. As a consequence, when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system, stability cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller, incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach, and present stability conditions relevant to the resulting sampled-data system. Additionally, we introduce an extension designed to enhance control performance. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method not only enhances control effectiveness but also effectively discerns stability degradation resulting from discretization, a nuance often overlooked by conventional methods.", "authors": "Ryuta Moriyasu, Sho Kawaguchi, Kenji Kashima", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

We first describe a method for a pair of identical oscillators and then generalize it to the case of slightly nonidentical oscillators. The coupling function is designed in two optimization steps for the functional form and amplitude, where the amplitude is numerically optimized to minimize the average convergence time under a constraint on the total power.

These types of plants are known for their strong disturbances coming from fuel composition fluctuations. Using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm ranks and selects inputs from the available sensor data and chooses the model structure.

{"title": "Stiffer alginate gels deposit more efficiently in microchannel flows", "abstract": "The behavior of crosslinking polymer solutions as they transition from liquid-like to solid-like material in flow determines success or failure in several applications, from 3D printing to oil recovery in the earth's subsurface to a wide variety of biological flows. Dilute polymer solutions flow easily, while concentrated polymers or crosslinked polymer gels can clog pores, nozzles, or channels. We have recently uncovered and described a third regime of flow dynamics in polymers that occurs when crosslinking happens during flow: intermittent flows. In a model system of alginate and calcium meeting at a Y-shaped junction in a microfluidic channel, a persistent and regular pattern of intermittent flow occurs when driven at a constant volume flow rate. At the junction, calcium crosslinks alginate to form an alginate gel, which subsequently deposits on the channel wall. As gel continues to deposit, it obstructs the channel, causing the driving pressure to increase to maintain a constant flow rate. At a critical pressure, corresponding to a critical shear stress, the fluid pulls the gel from the wall, removing the gel from the device and resulting in a clear channel. The gel deposit begins again, and the process then repeats as long as flow continues. Chemical concentrations and flow rate control both the frequency of ablation and the critical shear stress. In this work, we provide an analytical framework to quantitatively describe the intermittent behavior as a result of diffusively driven deposition in a high Peclet number flow where convection dominates. Fitting the experimental data to the model allows estimation of the deposition efficiency, or the fraction of flowing material that sticks to the channel walls. By correlating the results of the model with bulk rheology measurements, we find that deposition efficiency increases with the stiffness of the gel formed in flow.", "authors": "Barrett T Smith, Sara M Hashmi", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

The dimensional characteristics of solution within nanoscale systems depend on the degrees of confinement. However, the influence of such variations on heat transfer remains inadequately understood. Here, we perform quasi-one-dimensional non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the thermal conductivity of water molecules confined in carbon nanotubes. The structure of water molecules is determined depending on the nanotube radius, forming a single-file, a single-layer, and a double-layer structure, corresponding to an increasing radius order. We reveal that the thermal conductivity of liquid water has a sublinear dependency on nanotube length exclusively when water molecules form a single file. Stronger confinement leads to behavioral and structural characteristics closely resembling a one-dimensional nature. Moreover, single-layer-structure water molecules exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity. We elucidate that this is due to the minor vibration of water molecules perpendicular to the heat flux direction and the absence of transitions to another layer that occurs in the system in which they form a double layer in relatively large radius nanotubes.", "authors": "Shun Imamura, Yusei Kobayashi, Eiji Yamamoto", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

To address the measurement challenge, we leverage the perturbative nature of the corner twisted boundary condition and develop a real-space approach for determining the MWN in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. The real-space formula provides an experimentally viable strategy for directly probing the topology of chiral-symmetric HOTIs through dynamical evolution.

Specifically, the localized polariton condensate can be tuned among different potential traps by adjusting the relative distance between the small pump spot and the potential lattice. The adjustment of the excitation position of the smaller pump and its combination with the bigger pump for the potential creation induce a position-dependent loss distribution across the system. The localization of the exciton polariton condensate and its control are independent of the orientation of the potential lattice, thus, even in slightly disordered system, one can selectively excite such localized polariton condensates.

The impact of the symmetry-breaking dissipators on the long-time dynamics of the driven system are analyzed as functions of the drive strength and detuning, covering the deep quantum to near-classical regimes. Phase localization and frequency entrainment, which are required for synchronization, are discussed in detail. We identify a large parameter space where the oscillators exhibit appreciable phase localization but only weak or no entrainment, indicating the absence of synchronization.

{"title": "Spin current leakage and Onsager reciprocity in interfacial spin-charge interconversion", "abstract": "Experimental investigations of spin-charge interconversion in magnetic bilayers comprising a ferromagnet adjacent to a topological insulator have reported scattered results on the spin-charge and charge-spin conversion efficiency. Attempting to reconcile these contradicting experimental results, we develop a phenomenological theory of spin-charge interconversion accounting for both interfacial interconversion through the spin galvanic effect, also called the Rashba-Edelstein effect, as well as bulk interconversion via the spin Hall effect. We find that the spin current leakage into the nonmagnetic metal plays a central role during the spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversion, leading to dissymmetric interconversion processes. In particular, spin-to-charge conversion is much less sensitive to the spin current absorption in the nonmagnetic metal than charge-to-spin conversion. This suggests that spin pumping is a more trustable technique to extract the interfacial Rashba parameter than spin-orbit torque.", "authors": "Aurelien Manchon, Shuyuan Shi, Hyunsoo Yang", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Towards interpreting the thermally activated $β$ dynamics in metallic glass with the structural constraint neural network", "abstract": "Unraveling the structural factors influencing the dynamics of amorphous solids is crucial. While deep learning aids in navigating these complexities, transparency issues persist. Inspired by the successful application of prototype neural networks in the field of image analysis, this study introduces a new machine-learning approach to tackle the interpretability challenges faced in glassy research. Distinguishing from traditional machine learning models that only predict dynamics from the structural input, the adapted neural network additionally tries to learn structural prototypes under various dynamic patterns in the training phase. Such learned structural constraints can serve as a breakthrough in explaining how structural differences impact dynamics. We further use the proposed model to explore the correlation between the local structure and activation energy in the CuZr metallic glass. Building upon this interpretable model, we demonstrated significant structural differences among particles with distinct activation energies. The insights gained from this analysis serve as a data-driven solution for unraveling the origins of the structural heterogeneity in amorphous alloys, offering a valuable contribution to the understanding the amorphous materials.", "authors": "Xiao Jiang, Zean Tian, Kenli Li, Wangyu Hu", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

On-site correlation effects are found to considerably impact the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization and the optical conductivity. Remarkable agreement with recent experimental spectra at ambient pressure is achieved for $U \\sim 3$ eV, which simultaneously provides an electronic structure consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and accurate lattice parameters. The renormalizations of the optical spectrum induced by explicit oxygen vacancies, which form predominantly at the inner apical sites, further improve the agreement with experiment, and the concomitant electron doping is largely accommodated by a defect state. We show that the structural transition occurring under high pressure leads to a quenched low-energy in-plane spectral weight due to vanishing octahedral rotations. Simultaneously, a significant reduction of the out-of-plane component acts as a fingerprint of the emerging hole pocket. Comparison with infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$ uncovers a substantially enhanced optical response and anisotropy for the bilayer compound, reflecting fundamental differences in the electronic structure.

{"title": "Coexistence of large anomalous Nernst effect and large coercive force in amorphous ferrimagnetic TbCo alloy films", "abstract": "The Anomalous Nernst Effect (ANE) has garnered significant interest for practical applications, particularly in energy harvesting and heat flux sensing. For these applications, it is crucial for the module to operate without an external magnetic field, necessitating a combination of a large ANE and a substantial coercive force. However, most materials exhibiting a large ANE typically have a relatively small coercive force. In our research, we have explored the ANE in amorphous ferrimagnetic TbCo alloy films, noting that the coercive force peaks at the magnetization compensation point (MCP). We observed that transverse Seebeck coefficients are amplified with Tb doping, reaching more than 1.0 uV/K over a wide composition range near the MCP, which is three times greater than that of pure Co. Our findings indicate that this enhancement is primarily due to direct conversion, a product of the transverse thermoelectric component and electrical resistivity. TbCo films present several significant advantages for practical use: a large ANE, the capability to exhibit both positive and negative ANE, the flexibility to be deposited on any substrate due to their amorphous nature, a low thermal conductivity, and a large coercive force. These attributes make TbCo films a promising material for advancing ANE-based technologies.", "authors": "Miho Odagiri, Hiroto Imaeda, Ahmet Yagmur, Yuichiro Kurokawa, Satoshi Sumi, Hiroyuki Awano, Kenji Tanabe", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

However, in tungsten-based TMDs, dark excitons are known to be the energetically lowest states and could thus provide important scattering partners for polaritons. In this joint theory-experiment work, we investigate the impact of the full exciton energy landscape on polariton absorption and reflectance. By changing the cavity detuning, we vary the polariton energy relative to the unaffected dark excitons in such a way that we open or close specific phonon-driven scattering channels. We demonstrate both in theory and experiment that this controlled switching of scattering channels manifests in characteristic sharp changes in optical spectra of polaritons. These spectral features can be exploited to extract the position of dark excitons.

However, a recent study (J. Phys. Chem. 2021, 12, 800-807) has highlighted the limitation of xDH methods in calculating the dissociation of the NaCl molecule. This issue has been related to the density and orbitals used for evaluating the energy in xDH methods, which are obtained from lower-rung hybrid density functional approximations (DFAs) and display substantial density errors in the dissociation limit. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of density on several challenging datasets and find that the xDH methods are less sensitive to the density errors compared to semi-local and hybrid DFAs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the self-interaction corrected SCAN density offers superior accuracy compared to the self-consistent SCAN density and Hartree-Fock (HF) density, as evidenced by the charge analysis on the dissociation of heterodimers, such as NaCl and LiF. Building on these insights, we propose a 5-parameter xDH method using the SCAN density and orbitals corrected by the PZ-SIC scheme.

Our numerical results show that an X-shaped structure helps to manipulate its electronic and phononic properties. The transport energy gap can be tuned in the range of ~0.8 eV by changing one arm width. Due to the drastic decrease in the electronic conductance of HETX-CBN and the dominance of the phononic thermal conductance, the ZT performance is degraded despite the high S value (in the order of meV). However, HETX-C has better ZT performance due to better electronic conductance and lower phononic/electronic thermal ratio, it can enhance the ZT ~2.5 times compared to that of zigzag graphene nanoribbon.

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we perform a shear deformation test, obtaining the stress-strain curve for CuZr metallic glass samples. The atomic configurations of the metallic glass are mapped to a graph, where a node represents an atom whose stress/strain is above a certain threshold, and edges are connections between existing nodes at consecutive timesteps in the simulation. We made a statistical study of some physical descriptors such as shear stress, shear strain, volumetric strain and non-affine displacement to use them as construction tools for complex networks. We have calculated their probability density functions, skewness, kurtosis and gini coefficient to analyze the inequality of the distributions. We study the evolution of the resulting complex network, by computing topological metrics such as degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness and closeness centrality as a function of the strain. We have obtained correlations between the physical phenomena produced by the deformation with the data recorded by these metrics. By means the visual representation of the networks, we have also found direct correlations between metrics and the local atomic shear strain, so that they are able to predict the location of shear bands, as well as the formation of highly connected and interacting communities, which we interpret as shear transformation zones.

{"title": "Dislocation assisted coarsening of coherent precipitates: a phase field study", "abstract": "Coarsening of precipitates in coherent systems is influenced by the elastic fields of the precipitates and the interfacial curvature. It is also known that if precipitates are connected by dislocations, coarsening is affected by the elastic fields of the dislocations and the pipe diffusivity. Although there is experimental evidence of accelerated coarsening in the presence of dislocations, these studies do not capture the effect of the elastic fields. There exist generic theoretical models that can predict the average sizes and size distributions of coarsening precipitates considering the coherency related elastic stress fields. In this paper, we use a phase field model to study the coarsening of precipitates connected by dislocations, incorporating its elastic fields and pipe diffusivity. Specifically, we study the effects of misfit strain, elastic moduli mismatch, faster pipe mobility and the elastic fields of the dislocation on the morphology and kinetics of the coarsening precipitates. The dilatational component, associated with the edge character of the dislocations interact with the precipitates in an elastically homogeneous system. In an elastically inhomogeneous system, the deviatoric elastic fields also interact with the precipitates influencing the morphology and kinetics of coarsening precipitates. The kinetics of coarsening is different as well, with hard precipitates coarsening faster as compared to soft precipitates, when connected by dislocations. Further, we note that the modified Gibbs-Thomson equation, which was originally derived for an isolated precipitate in an infinite matrix, is also applicable for coarsening precipitates at close proximity.", "authors": "Arjun Varma R, Prita Pant, M P Gururajan", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

Hence, this work extends quantum-mechanical accuracy to mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations and opens unprecedented possibilities in material design for extreme mechanical conditions with direct atomistic insight at the deformation mesoscale. To accomplish this, we construct a Bayesian machine-learned force field (MLFF) from ab initio quantum training data, enabling direct observations of high-temperature and high-stress dislocation dynamics in single-crystalline Cu with atomistic resolution. In doing so, a generalizable training protocol is developed for construction of MLFFs for dislocation kinetics, with wide-ranging applicability to other single element systems and alloys. The resulting FLARE MLFF provides excellent predictions of static bulk elastic properties, stacking fault widths and energies, dynamic evolutions and mobilities of edge and screw dislocations, as well as cross-slip energy barriers for screw dislocations, all of which are compared to available experimental measurements.

This study employs differential geometry and calculus of variations to mathematically model and numerically analyse screw dislocations. The kinematics of the dislocation are expressed by the diffeomorphism of the Riemann--Cartan manifold, which includes both the Riemannian metric and affine connection. The modelling begins with a continuous distribution of dislocation density, which is transformed into torsion $\\tau$ through the Hodge duality. The plasticity functional is constructed by applying the Helmholtz decomposition to bundle isomorphism, which is equivalent to the Cartan first structure equation for the intermediate configuration $\\mathcal{B}$. The current configuration is derived by the elastic embedding of $\\mathcal{B}$ into the standard Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The numerical analysis reveals the elastic stress fields effectively eliminate the singularity along the dislocation line and exhibit excellent conformity with Volterra's theory beyond the dislocation core. Geometrical frustration is the direct source of dislocation stress fields, as demonstrated through the multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradients.

In this work, we explore the performance of a recently developed two-temperature molecular dynamics model implementing an electron density-dependent coupling of electronic and atomic subsystems for cascade simulations in nickel. We show that the parameter-free model realistically captures the instantaneous energy losses during all stages of the highly non-equilibrium cascade process. Simulations predict two distinct coupling regimes, corresponding to the rapid electronic stopping energy losses in the early stages of the cascade and to the electron-phonon coupling mechanism in the later stages, without the use of separate coupling terms. The intermediate stage of the cascade dynamics displays a complex energy transfer between the subsystems, which cannot be validated by comparison to either electronic stopping or electron-phonon coupling theories. We therefore compare the predicted atomic mixing, which is sensitive to the energy losses during the intermediate cascade stage, with experimental ion beam mixing measurements. We find good agreement with the experiments, validating the coupling model for the intermediate stage of cascades. Predictions of final defect numbers and cluster sizes are found in line with the predictions of conventional electronic stopping-based methods, while significantly reducing the theoretical uncertainty in the predictions of conventional models stemming from arbitrary choices of thresholds for different coupling terms.

Some of them also change under the application of a weak bias magnetic field at room temperature. Three lowest-frequency modes seen between 200 MHz and 3 GHz were assigned to the dynamics of the magnetic domains. The mode attributed to the natural ferromagnetic resonance exhibits a dramatic critical slowing-down from 25 GHz at 390 K to 5 GHz near the 305 K phase transition, and again a hardening to ~11 GHz on further cooling.

The dependence of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) on applied electric field is experimentally investigated in the system by the Brilloin light scattering method. A strong variation (from -0.2 to 0.8 mJ/m2) of the iDMI constant is observed when the electric field is applied. In the case of [001] cut, the observed changes in the iDMI have an isotropic character, while in the case of [110] cut they are anisotropic, which corresponds to the symmetry of the PMN-PT deformations. The change in the iDMI is accompanied by the formation of various unusual domain structures and skyrmion lattices.

This makes RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ an outstanding candidate for realizing the high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect. The growth of RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ thin films is beneficial for both fundamental research and potential applications.

However, current literature primarily focuses on improving thermopower only, while the ion transport and thermodynamics affecting the efficiencies have been largely neglected.

Two major types of i-TE devices, thermo-ionic capacitors (TIC) and thermogalvanic cells (TGC), are discussed in detail. The article analyzes the methods of enhancing ionic thermopower in the literature by taking an entropic point of view. We also derived modified thermoelectric factor Z for both TICs and TGCs that fully incorporate the dynamics of ion transport and electrochemical reactions.

In this work, the square-lattice materials YbBi2IO4 and YbBi2ClO4 were investigated using a combination of magnetization and specific heat measurements on polycrystalline samples. Specific heat measurements provide evidence for long-range magnetic order below TN = 0.21 K (0.25 K) for YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4). On the other hand, a rather broad maximum is found in the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, located at Tmax = 0.33 K (0.38 K) in YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4), consistent with the quasi-2D magnetism expected for the large separation between the magnetic layers. Estimation of the magnetic entropy supports the expected Kramers' doublet ground state for Yb3+ and the observed paramagnetic behavior is consistent with a well-isolated doublet. Roughly two-thirds of the entropy is consumed above TN, due to a combination of the quasi-2D behavior and magnetic frustration. The impact of frustration is examined from the viewpoint of a simplified J1-J2 square lattice model, which is frustrated for antiferromagnetic interactions. Specifically, a high-temperature series expansion analysis of the temperature-dependent specific heat and magnetization data yields J2/J1 = 0.30 (0.23) for YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4). This simplified analysis suggests strong frustration that should promote significant quantum fluctuations in these compounds, and thus motivates future work on the static and dynamic magnetic properties of these materials.", "authors": "Pyeongjae Park, G.

The PPMS and XMCD measurements give information regarding the composition in the bulk of the alloys. The XPS measurements show non-homogeneous composition at the surface of the alloys with a strongly increased Gd content within the first layers compared to the nominal bulk values.

Key structural features in the alloy systems, including crystal phase, chemical ordering, and morphology, are challenging to control at the nanoscale, making it difficult to transfer their usage to industrial applications. In this contribution, we focus on the gold/silver system that has two of the most prevalent noble metals, and combine experiments with simulations to uncover the formation mechanisms at the atomic-level. Nanoparticles are produced using state-of-the-art inert-gas aggregation source and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are employed to model the crystallization process from liquid droplets to nanocrystals. Our study finds a preponderance of nanoparticles with five-fold symmetric morphology, including icosahedron and decahedron which is consistent with previous results on mono-metallic nanoparticles. However, we observe that gold atoms, rather than silver atoms, segregate at the surface of the obtained nanoparticles for all the considered alloy compositions. These segregation tendencies are in contrast to previous studies and have consequences on the crystallization dynamics and the subsequent crystal ordering. We finally show that the underpinnings of this surprising segregation dynamics is due to charge transfer and electrostatic interactions rather than surface energy considerations.", "authors": "Quentin Gromoff, Patrizio Benzo, Wissam A.

In fact, no polar phases exist in the bulk phase diagram of HfO$_2$, which shows a dominant non-polar monoclinic ground state. As a consequence, ferroelectric orthorhombic HfO$_2$ needs to be kinetically stabilized. Here, we propose an alternative approach, demonstrating the feasibility of thermodynamically stabilizing polar HfO$_2$ in superlattices with other simple oxides. Using the composition and stacking direction of the superlattice as design parameters, we obtain heterostructures that can be fully polar, fully antipolar or mixed, with improved thermodynamic stability compared to the orthorhombic polar HfO$_2$ in bulk form. Our results suggest that combining HfO$_2$ with an oxide that does not have a monoclinic ground state generally drives the superlattice away from this non-polar phase, favoring the stability of the ferroelectric structures that minimize the elastic and electrostatic penalties. As such, these diverse and tunable superlattices hold promise for various applications in thin-film ferroelectric devices.", "authors": "Binayak Mukherjee, Natalya S.

In this study, we develop a computational model of three-dimensional cubic-topological, swollen polymer networks of semi-flexible filaments. We perform Langevin dynamics simulations to investigate the diffusion of active tracer particles navigating through these networks. By analyzing various physical observables, we investigate the effects of mesh-to-particle size ratio, Péclet number of active particles, and bending stiffness of the polymer networks upon active trapped-and-hopping diffusion of the tracer. When the tracer size is equal to or larger than the mesh size, the polymer stiffness substantially enhances trapping while suppressing the hopping process. Notably, the mean trapped time exhibits an exponential growth law to the bending stiffness with an activity-dependent slope. An analytic theory based on the mean first-passage time of active particles in a harmonic potential is developed. Our findings deepen the comprehension of the intricate interplay between the polymer's bending stiffness, tracer size, and the activity of tracer particles.

Here, by employing the cutting-edge momentum-lattice technique, we implement a synthetic SU(2) gauge field in a spinful 1D ladder and study the rich chiral dynamics therein. We confirm the non-Abelian nature of the synthetic potential by observing the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect on a single plaquette.

Fluids \\textbf{33}, 023310 (2021)] is considered further to analyze two different problems. First, a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations with respect to the homogeneous steady state (HSS) is carried out to identify the conditions for stability as functions of the wave vector, the coefficients of restitution, and the parameters of the mixture. The analysis, which is based on the results obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in spatial gradients, takes into account the (nonlinear) dependence of the transport coefficients and the cooling rate on the coefficients of restitution and applies in principle to arbitrary values of the concentration, and the mass and diameter ratios. In contrast to the results obtained in the conventional inelastic hard sphere (IHS) model, the results show that all the hydrodynamic modes are stable so that, the HSS is linearly \\emph{stable} with respect to long enough wavelength excitations. As a second application, segregation induced by both a thermal gradient and gravity is studied. A segregation criterion based on the dependence of the thermal diffusion factor $\\Lambda$ on the parameter space of the mixture is derived.

Motivated by field theoretical arguments and lattice model calculations, we demonstrate that the key feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect for $m$-pole conserving systems is the generation of an $(m+1)$th multipole moment. For example, in contrast to the conventional skin effect where charges are anomalously localized at one boundary, the dipole-conserving skin effect results in charges localized at both boundaries, in a configuration that generates an extremal quadrupole moment. In addition, we explore the dynamical consequences of the $m$-pole skin effect, focusing on charge and entanglement propagation. Both numerically and analytically, we provide evidence that long-time steady-states have Fock-space localization and an area-law scaling of entanglement entropy, which serve as quantum indicators of the skin effect.", "authors": "Jacopo Gliozzi, Giuseppe De Tomasi, Taylor L.

Upon lifting the energy offset, different tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the circular trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns in the macroscopic tunneling regime.

{"title": "Self-organization of active colloids mediated by chemical interactions", "abstract": "Self-propelled colloidal particles exhibit rich non-equilibrium phenomena and have promising applications in fields such as drug delivery and self-assembled active materials. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown that chemically active colloids that consume or produce a chemical can self-organize into clusters with diverse characteristics depending on the effective phoretic interactions. In this paper, we investigate self-organization in systems with multiple chemical species that undergo a network of reactions and multiple colloidal species that participate in different reactions. Active colloids propelled by complex chemical reactions with potentially nonlinear kinetics can be realized using enzymatic reactions that occur on the surface of enzyme-coated particles. To demonstrate how the self-organizing behavior depends on the chemical reactions active colloids catalyze and their chemical environment, we consider first a single type of colloid undergoing a simple catalytic reaction, and compare this often-studied case with self-organization in binary mixtures of colloids with sequential reactions, and binary mixtures with nonlinear autocatalytic reactions. Our results show that in general active colloids at low particle densities can form localized clusters in the presence of bulk chemical reactions and phoretic attractions. The characteristics of the clusters, however, depend on the reaction kinetics in the bulk and on the particles and phoretic coefficients. With one or two chemical species that only undergo surface reactions, the space for possible self-organizations are limited. By considering the additional system parameters that enter the chemical reaction network involving reactions on the colloids and in the fluid, the design space of colloidal self-organization can be enlarged, leading to a variety of non-equilibrium structures.", "authors": "Zhiwei Peng, Raymond Kapral", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

We extend our analysis also to the presence of axial confinement showing the effect of the trap on the density profile and therefore on the breathing mode frequency scaling. Our analysis confirms the stability of the quantum droplet against the particles emission when the flat-top density profile is observed.

The temporary equilibrium positions of atoms do not form any regular structure and are not fixed, unlike in solids. Instead, they are allowed to diffuse and this is why liquids can flow. However, this diffusive motion is characterized by much longer time scales compared to those of solid-like oscillations. Although this general picture is not particularly new, only in a recent series of works it has been possible to construct a coherent and internally consistent {\\it quantitative} description of transport properties such as self-diffusion, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Moreover, the magnitudes of these transport coefficients have been related to the properties of collective excitations in dense fluids. Importantly, the model is simple and no free parameters are involved. Recent achievements are summarized in this overview. Application of the vibrational model to various single-component model systems such as plasma-related Coulomb and screened Coulomb (Yukawa) fluids, the Lennard-Jones fluid, and the hard-sphere fluid is considered in detail.

{"title": "Hyperelastic swelling of tough hydrogels", "abstract": "Hydrogels are biphasic, swollen polymer networks where elastic deformation is coupled to nanoscale fluid flow. As a consequence, hydrogels can withstand large strains and exhibit nonlinear, hyperelastic properties. For low-modulus hydrogel and semiflexible biopolymer networks, previous studies have shown that these materials universally contract when sheared on timescales much longer than the poroelastic relaxation timescale. Using rheological and tribological measurements, we find that tough polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid hydrogels, with moduli of order ~10-100 kPa, exclusively exhibit dilatancy when sheared. The poroelastic relaxation process was examined using strain-controlled compression, indicating a diffusion constant of order 10^-9 m^2/s. On short timescales (minutes), an applied shear stress induced an increase in normal stress that varied quadratically with shear strain. At long timescales (hours), creep experiments revealed that tough hydrogels can ``remember'' the initial direction of applied shear, suggesting an evolution of the polymer network. Moreover, we show that this dilatant behavior manifests as swelling during tribological sliding, imbibing the hydrogel with fluid. We suggest that this inherent, hyperelastic dilatancy is an important feature in all tough hydrogels, and may explain rehydration and mechanical rejuvenation in biological tissues such as cartilage.", "authors": "Jing Wang, Justin C.

We characterize the golden braid state using different measures of topological entropy and the Lyapunov exponent.

{"title": "Force Propagation in Active Cytoskeletal Networks", "abstract": "In biological systems, molecular-scale forces and motions are pivotal for enabling processes like motility, shape change, and replication. These forces and motions are organized, amplified, and transmitted across macroscopic scales by active materials such as the cytoskeleton, which drives micron-scale cellular movement and re-organization. Despite the integral role of active materials, understanding how molecular-scale interactions alter macroscopic structure and force propagation remains elusive. This knowledge gap presents challenges to the harnessing and regulation of such dynamics across diverse length scales. Here, we demonstrate how mediating the bundling of microtubules can shift active matter between a global force-transmitting phase and a local force-dissipating phase. A fivefold increase in microtubule effective length results in the transition from local to global phase with a hundredfold increase in velocity autocorrelation. Through theory and simulation, we identify signatures of a percolation-driven transition between the two phases. This provides evidence for how force propagation can be generated when local molecular interactions reach a sufficient length scale. We show that force propagation in the active matter system enables material transport. Consequently, we demonstrate that the global phase is capable of facilitating millimeter-scale human cell transport and manipulation, as well as powering the movement of aqueous droplets. These findings underscore the potential for designing active materials capable of force organization and transmission.

For this, a linear polymer chain is modeled by a self voiding walks (SAWs) on a square lattice. The cis-side of a cone-shaped channel has a finite volume, whereas the trans-side has a semi-infinite space. The confining environment is varied either by changing the position of the back wall while keeping the apex angle fixed or altering the apex angle while keeping the position of the back wall fixed. In both cases, the effective space {\\phi}, which represents the number of monomers in a chain relative to the total number of accessible sites within the cone, is reduced due to the imposed confinement. Consequently, the translocation dynamics are affected. We analyze the entropy of the confined system as a function {\\phi}, which exhibits non-monotonic behaviour. We also calculate the free energy associated with the confinement as a function of a virtual coordinate for different positions of the back wall (base of the cone) along the conical axis for various apex angles.Employing the Fokker-Planck equation, we calculate the translocation time as a function of {\\phi} for different solvent conditions across the pore. Our findings indicate that the translocation time decreases as {\\phi} increases, but it eventually reaches a saturation point at a certain value of {\\phi}.

By numerical simulation we demonstrate a dynamical oscillation between the spin-Alice ring and a split-core hedgehog configuration via the appearance of ferromagnetic rings with associated vorticity inside an extended core region. We further show that a similar dynamics is exhibited by a spin-Alice ring surrounding a spin-vortex line resulting from the relaxation of a monopole situated on a spin-vortex line in the biaxial-nematic phase. In the cyclic phase similar states are shown instead to form extended phase-mixing cores containing rings with fractional mass circulation or cores whose spatial shape reflect the order-parameter symmetry of cyclic inner core, depending on the initial configuration.", "authors": "Giuseppe Baio, Magnus O.

However, when the temperature is increased, but still in the Bose-condensed phase, the impurity occupies the core of the trap and, thus, the system becomes miscible. This thermal-induced miscibility transition is also observed for a finite concentration of impurities in this inhomogeneous system. We find that the transition temperature for miscibility depends on the impurity-boson interaction and we indicate a novel nondestructive method to measure the temperature of a system based on the studied phenomenon.", "authors": "G.

In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that holistically addresses these hurdles. Given a Boolean composition of multiple state constraints that define the safe set, our approach starts with building a single continuously differentiable function whose 0-superlevel set provides an inner approximation of the safe set. We then use this function together with a smooth neural network to parameterize the CBF candidate. Finally, we design a training loss function based on a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation to train the CBF while enlarging the volume of the induced control invariant set.

As the direct link from the source to the destination is unavailable, and there is no noiseless relay in the diamond network, messages received from both relays must act as side information for each other and must be decoded jointly. We propose a joint decoder to decode two Luby transform (LT) codes received from both relays corresponding to the same original message.

Van der Waals heterostructures, which are created by stacking distinct 2D crystals on top of each other, are becoming increasingly important due to their unique optoelectronic and electromechanical properties. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the mechanical characteristics of vertically stacked Silicene/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructures are examined in this study. The response and structural stability of the heterostructures at various loading orientations and temperatures are given particular attention. The research findings highlight that the fracture strength of the Silicene/MoS2 heterostructure decreases by 40% in both armchair and zigzag orientations when the temperature is raised from 100K to 600K. Furthermore, a linear decrease in Young's modulus is observed as temperature rises. It is noteworthy that the Rule of Mixture (ROM) predictions for Young's Moduli are observed to be marginally lower than the simulation results. The analyses reveal that the silicene layer fractures first under both loading directions shows crack propagation at +-60°in the armchair and predominantly perpendicular in zigzag, followed by subsequent MoS2 layer failure. The study also shows that the MoS2 layer largely determines the elastic properties of the heterostructure, whereas the silicene layer primarily dictates the failure of the heterostructure.

More precisely, the unreliability of communication channels sometimes makes an agent incapable of sensing the local information or receiving it from neighboring nodes. Therefore, an intermittent communication scheme is proposed among the follower agents as a consequence of employing the linear auxiliary dynamics. The closed-loop networked system signals are proved to be noise-to-state practically stable in probability (NSpS-P). It has been justified that each agent follows the trajectory of the corresponding local auxiliary virtual system practically in probability. The simulation experiments finally quantify the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of providing a resilient performance against unreliability of communication channels and reaching the tracking consensus.", "authors": "Ali Azarbahram", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds", "abstract": "This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. Herein, we argue that this elastic softening can be attributed to the effect of electric-quadrupole degrees of freedom of the dangling bonds in the neutral single-atom vacancies of carbon. We present the results of ultrasonic investigations of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observe a magnetic-field-insensitive softening of the elastic constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures below 1 K. Our results strongly suggest a ppb level concentration of neutral single-atomic vacancies in all investigated diamonds.

Using first-principles calculations, we propose two C4N monolayers with a zigzag buckled (ZB) structure. The ZB C4N monolayers contain raised-C (raised-N) atoms with sp3 hybridization, different from the traditional 2D graphene-like carbon nitride materials with sp2 hybridization. Interestingly, the band structures of the ZB C4N monolayers exhibit quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Dirac nodal line that results from the corresponding quasi-1D structure of the zigzag carbon chains, which is essentially different from the more common ring-shaped nodal line. The quasi-1D Dirac nodal line exhibits the following features: (i) gapless Dirac points, (ii) varying Fermi velocity, and (iii) slightly curved band along the high-symmetry path. All these features are successfully explained by our proposed tight-binding model that includes interactions up to the third nearest-neighbor. The Fermi velocity of the 2D system can reach 105 m/s, which is promising for applications in high-speed electronic devices. The topological flat band structure determined by the Zak phase and band inversion of the corresponding 1D system is edge-dependent, which is corresponding to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, providing to rich physical phenomena.", "authors": "Linyang Li, Jialei Li, Yawei Yu, Yuxuan Song, Jia Li, Xiaobiao Liu, François M.

We begin the investigation by deriving the leading-order magnetic energy associated with a curved planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbon. The sum of the magnetic and the elastic energy is the total energy of the ribbon. We derive the equilibrium equations by taking the first variation of the total energy. We then systematically determine and analyse solutions to these equilibrium equations under various canonical boundary conditions. We also analyse the stability of the equilibrium solutions. Comparing our findings with the well-studied Euler's Elastica provides insights into the magnetic effects on the deformation behaviour of elastic ribbons.

{"title": "Secure Dynamic Event-triggered Consensus Under Asynchronous Denial of Service", "abstract": "This article proposes a secure implementation for consensus using a dynamic event-triggered (DET) communication scheme in high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) under asynchronous (distributed) denial of service (DoS) attacks. By introducing a linear auxiliary trajectory of the system, the DET data transmission scheme among the neighboring agents is employed to reduce the communication for each agent. The asynchronous DoS attacks can block each communication channel among the cooperative agents independently in an unknown pattern. To guarantee state consensus of auxiliary MAS under DoS, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based optimization approach is proposed which simultaneously designs all the unknown DET communication parameters as well as the state feedback control gain. In addition to asynchronous DoS attacks over the graph topology, the destructive effects of independent DoS attacks over the communication links between actual and auxiliary states are compensated as an additional layer of resiliency for the system. The output of each agent ultimately tracks the auxiliary state of the system and this results in the output consensus.", "authors": "Ali Azarbahram, Amir Amini", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

The surface passivation and carrier selectivity of the interface between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ allotropes of arsenene, antimonene, and bismuthene monolayers with Si (100) and Si(111) were estimated \\emph{via} first--principles calculations. Amongst the various interface configurations studied, all of the Si(111)--based slabs and only a couple of the Si(100)--based slabs are found to be stable. Bader charge analysis reveals that charge transfer from/to the Si slab to (As)/from (Sb and Bi) in the 2D layer occurs, indicating a strong interaction between atoms across the interface. Comparing within the various configurations of a particular charge (electron or hole) selective layer, the structural distortion of the Si slab is the lowest for $\\alpha$--As/Si and $\\beta$-Bi/Si. This translates as a lower surface density of states (DOS) in the band gap arising out of the Si slab when integrated with $\\alpha$--arsenene and $\\beta$--bismuthene, implying better surface passivation. All-in-all, our analysis suggests $\\alpha$-As as the best candidate for a passivating electron selective layer, while $\\beta$-Bi can be a promising candidate for a passivating hole selective layer.", "authors": "Gurudayal Behera, K.

Here we report the centrosymmetric, one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic WOI$_3$ undergoes a strain-induced ferroelectric distortion. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition is originated from the unconventional anisotropic $d^1$ mechanism, where an unpaired d electron of each W$^{5+}$ ion contributes to magnetic orders. Employing a Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict an antiferromagnetic spin configuration as the paraelectric ground state, transitioning to a ferroelectric phase with noncollinear spin arrangement under uniaxial strain. The ferroelectric polarization and noncollinear spin arrangement can be manipulated by varying the applied strain. While the energy barriers for switching ferroelectric polarizations with magnetic orders are on the order of a few dozen of meV, the shift current bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) exhibits remarkable differences, providing a precise and valuable tool for experimentally probing the interplay of ferroelectric and magnetic orders in 1D WOI$_3$.", "authors": "Zhihao Gong, Yechen Xun, Zhuang Qian, Kai Chang, Jingshan Qi, Hua Wang", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},

The large number of atoms in the unit cell results in low acoustic phonon cutoff frequency, flat phonon branches, low frequency Raman active modes, localized rattler-like vibrations and strong crystalline anharmonicity. The crystal structure complexity disrupts the phonon propagation through weak bonded Cu atoms, boson peak and poor phonon velocity. The sulfur at selenium sites (Cu26V2Sn6Se30S2) distort the crystal lattice by offering additional scattering mechanism at the anionic sites, thereby increases the power factor and decreases the kl.

{"title": "Nearly optimal quasienergy estimation and eigenstate preparation of time-periodic Hamiltonians by Sambe space formalism", "abstract": "Time-periodic (Floquet) systems are one of the most interesting nonequilibrium systems. As the computation of energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians is a central problem in both classical and quantum computation, quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates are the important targets. However, their computation has difficulty of time dependence; the problem can be mapped to a time-independent eigenvalue problem by the Sambe space formalism, but it instead requires additional infinite dimensional space and seems to yield higher computational cost than the time-independent cases. It is still unclear whether they can be computed with guaranteed accuracy as efficiently as the time-independent cases. We address this issue by rigorously deriving the cutoff of the Sambe space to achieve the desired accuracy and organizing quantum algorithms for computing quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates based on the cutoff. The quantum algorithms return quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates with guaranteed accuracy like Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which is the optimal algorithm for outputting energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians. While the time periodicity provides the additional dimension for the Sambe space and ramifies the eigenstates, the query complexity of the algorithms achieves the near-optimal scaling in allwable errors. In addition, as a by-product of these algorithms, we also organize a quantum algorithm for Floquet eigenstate preparation, in which a preferred gapped Floquet eigenstate can be deterministically implemented with nearly optimal query complexity in the gap. These results show that, despite the difficulty of time-dependence, quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates can be computed almost as efficiently as time-independent cases, shedding light on the accurate and fast simulation of nonequilibrium systems on quantum computers.", "authors": "Kaoru Mizuta", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

We record photoluminescence and reflection spectra at interlayer distances between 0.5 nm and 5.8 nm (0-16 hBN layers). We find that the energy transfer is dominated by states outside the light cone, indicative of a Förster transfer process, with an additional contribution from a Dexter process at 0.5 nm interlayer distance. We find that the measured dependence of the luminescence intensity on interlayer distances above 1 nm can be quantitatively described using recently reported values of the Förster transfer rates of thermalized charge carriers. At smaller interlayer distances, the experimentally observed transfer rates exceed the predictions and furthermore depend on excess energy as well as on excitation density. Since the transfer probability of the Förster mechanism depends on the momentum of electron-hole pairs, we conclude that at these distances, the transfer is driven by non-thermalized charge carrier distributions.", "authors": "David Tebbe, Marc Schütte, K.

The microstructure at the obtainable limit of strain are quite similar, which is a nanocrystalline structure in the order of 10 nm, dependent on the obtainable strain. The nanograins are partially supersaturated with carbon and the grain boundaries are stabilized by carbon. Another characteristic feature is the anisotropy in grain shape which results in an anisotropy of strength, ductility and fracture toughness.

In this approach, the phonon quasiparticle picture of each normal mode can be obtained directly by the velocity autocorrelation function and its power spectrum projected in $q$-space. By employing the retarded one phonon Green's function method, the phonon quasiparticle frequency and lifetime of each independent normal mode are effectively determined. On-the-fly machine learning force fields combine the precision of quantum mechanics and the scale of classical MD to analyze sizable supercells with long-wavelength phonons. This yields accurate LTC by using sufficient $q$-samples in the Brillouin zone, which cannot be achieved at the \\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics scale. The convergent LTC tensor of bulk and monolayer ZrSe$_2$ decays faster with increasing temperature than the well-known $\\frac{1}{T}$ scale, which is typically observed when considering only three-phonon scattering. The phonon lifetime and mean free path exhibit significant dependence on temperature. MD simulations encompass all orders of anharmonic effects, thereby enabling an accurate description of anharmonic interactions between phonons at finite temperatures.

In this work, we identify bound and unbound {Frenkel}-exciton complexes in an electron push-pull polymer semiconductor using coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy. We find that the dominant $A_{0-1}$ peak of the absorption vibronic progression is accompanied by a sub-peak, which we ascribe to excitons dressed by distinct vibrational modes. By considering the Liouville pathways within a two-exciton model, the two-dimensional cross-peak structure in one-quantum rephasing and non-rephasing spectra can be accounted for by the presence of pure biexcitons. The two-quantum non-rephasing spectra, on the other hand, provide direct evidence for biexcitons and unbound exciton pairs.

We propose a fast and scalable algorithm for the joint design of the base station (BS) multicast beamforming and the RIS passive beamforming to minimize the transmit power subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By exploring the structure of the joint optimization problem, we show that this QoS problem can be broken into a BS multicast QoS subproblem and an RIS max-min-fair (MMF) multicast subproblem, which are solved alternatingly. In our proposed algorithm, we utilize the optimal multicast beamforming structure to obtain the BS beamformers efficiently. Furthermore, we reformulate the challenging RIS multicast subproblem and employ a first-order projected subgradient algorithm (PSA) to solve it, which yields closed-form updates.

{"title": "Dynamic and Memory-efficient Shape Based Methodologies for User Type Identification in Smart Grid Applications", "abstract": "Detecting behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment and major appliances at the residential level and tracking their changes in real time is important for aggregators and traditional electricity utilities. In our previous work, we developed a systematic solution called IRMAC to identify residential users' BTM equipment and applications from their imported energy data. As a part of IRMAC, a Similarity Profile (SP) was proposed for dimensionality reduction and extracting self-join similarity from the end users' daily electricity usage data. The proposed SP calculation, however, was computationally expensive and required a significant amount of memory at the user's end. To realise the benefits of edge computing, in this paper, we propose and assess three computationally-efficient updating solutions, namely additive, fixed memory, and codebook-based updating methods. Extensive simulation studies are carried out using real PV users' data to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in identifying PV users, tracking changes in real time, and examining memory usage. We found that the Codebook-based solution reduces more than 30\\% of the required memory without compromising the performance of extracting users' features. When the end users' data storage and computation speed are concerned, the fixed-memory method outperforms the others. In terms of tracking the changes, different variations of the fixed-memory method show various inertia levels, making them suitable for different applications.", "authors": "Rui Yuan, S.

Recently, deep learning (DL) models have significantly enhanced the capabilities of SDTs, particularly for tasks such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and optimization. In many domains, including medicine, engineering, and education, SDTs use image data (image-based SDTs) to observe and learn system behaviors and control their behaviors.

However, despite being a cleaner alternative to combustion engine vehicles, EVs have negative impacts on the lifespan of microgrid equipment and energy balance due to increased power demand and the timing of their usage. In our view grid management should leverage on EVs scheduling flexibility to support local network balancing through active participation in demand response programs. In this paper, we propose a model-free solution, leveraging Deep Q-Learning to schedule the charging and discharging activities of EVs within a microgrid to align with a target energy profile provided by the distribution system operator. We adapted the Bellman Equation to assess the value of a state based on specific rewards for EV scheduling actions and used a neural network to estimate Q-values for available actions and the epsilon-greedy algorithm to balance exploitation and exploration to meet the target energy profile. The results are promising showing that the proposed solution can effectively schedule the EVs charging and discharging actions to align with the target profile with a Person coefficient of 0.99, handling effective EVs scheduling situations that involve dynamicity given by the e-mobility features, relying only on data with no knowledge of EVs and microgrid dynamics.", "authors": "Viorica Rozina Chifu, Tudor Cioara, Cristina Bianca Pop, Horia Rusu, Ionut Anghel", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Gain Scheduling with a Neural Operator for a Transport PDE with Nonlinear Recirculation", "abstract": "To stabilize PDE models, control laws require space-dependent functional gains mapped by nonlinear operators from the PDE functional coefficients. When a PDE is nonlinear and its \"pseudo-coefficient\" functions are state-dependent, a gain-scheduling (GS) nonlinear design is the simplest approach to the design of nonlinear feedback. The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains obtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE computations in real time may be prohibitive. The recently introduced neural operators (NO) can be trained to produce the gain functions, rapidly in real time, for each state value, without requiring a PDE solution. In this paper we introduce NOs for GS-PDE backstepping. GS controllers act on the premise that the state change is slow and, as a result, guarantee only local stability, even for ODEs. We establish local stabilization of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear recirculation using both a \"full-kernel\" approach and the \"gain-only\" approach to gain operator approximation. Numerical simulations illustrate stabilization and demonstrate speedup by three orders of magnitude over traditional PDE gain-scheduling.

Therefore, producing real time estimates with such observers is computationally burdensome. For both finite-dimensional and ODE systems, moving-horizon estimators (MHE) are operators whose output is the state estimate, while their inputs are the initial state estimate at the beginning of the horizon as well as the measured output and input signals over the moving time horizon. In this paper we introduce MHEs for PDEs which remove the need for a numerical solution of an observer PDE in real time. We accomplish this using the PDE backstepping method which, for certain classes of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, produces moving-horizon state estimates explicitly. Precisely, to explicitly produce the state estimates, we employ a backstepping transformation of a hard-to-solve observer PDE into a target observer PDE, which is explicitly solvable. The MHEs we propose are not new observer designs but simply the explicit MHE realizations, over a moving horizon of arbitrary length, of the existing backstepping observers. Our PDE MHEs lack the optimality of the MHEs that arose as duals of MPC, but they are given explicitly, even for PDEs. In the paper we provide explicit formulae for MHEs for both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, as well as simulation results that illustrate theoretically guaranteed convergence of the MHEs.", "authors": "Luke Bhan, Yuanyuan Shi, Iasson Karafyllis, Miroslav Krstic, James B.

For an off-grid renewable power to hydrogen system (OReP2HS), a grid-forming (GFM) source is essential to provide frequency and voltage references. Here, we take battery works as a GFM source, and the OReP2HS we focus on is comprised of solar photovoltaic, wind turbines, and alkaline electrolyzers for hydrogen generation. An elaborative full-time scale energy management strategy (EMS) covers GFM control to system scheduling (from milliseconds to hours) and is proposed to support high-precision production simulations. Loads of electrolysers are designed to track the renewable power closely to partly replace the energy balancing requirement of the battery. A continuous operation strategy during an emergency like a unit drop is also included in the presented EMS. An off-line simulation-based iterative searching algorithm is developed to find the most suitable size of the battery with the minimum levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). A practical OReP2H project located in Inner Mongolian, China is taken as a case study. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, and the optimized capacity of the battery (3.4MWh) only accounts for 13.6% of the total installed capacity of the sources with the proposed EMS. Sensitivity analysis shows that LOCH rises from 28.829 CYN/kg to 37.814 CYN/kg, with the time-step for fast power regulation of electrolysers changing from 4s to 1 min with a ramp rate of 0.05MW/s.", "authors": "Jie Zhu", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Adaptive Boosting with Fairness-aware Reweighting Technique for Fair Classification", "abstract": "Machine learning methods based on AdaBoost have been widely applied to various classification problems across many mission-critical applications including healthcare, law and finance. However, there is a growing concern about the unfairness and discrimination of data-driven classification models, which is inevitable for classical algorithms including AdaBoost. In order to achieve fair classification, a novel fair AdaBoost (FAB) approach is proposed that is an interpretable fairness-improving variant of AdaBoost. We mainly investigate binary classification problems and focus on the fairness of three different indicators (i.e., accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate). By utilizing a fairness-aware reweighting technique for base classifiers, the proposed FAB approach can achieve fair classification while maintaining the advantage of AdaBoost with negligible sacrifice of predictive performance. In addition, a hyperparameter is introduced in FAB to show preferences for the fairness-accuracy trade-off. An upper bound for the target loss function that quantifies error rate and unfairness is theoretically derived for FAB, which provides a strict theoretical support for the fairness-improving methods designed for AdaBoost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on three real-world datasets (i.e., Adult, COMPAS and HSLS) with respect to the three fairness indicators. The results are accordant with theoretic analyses, and show that (i) FAB significantly improves classification fairness at a small cost of accuracy compared with AdaBoost; and (ii) FAB outperforms state-of-the-art fair classification methods including equalized odds method, exponentiated gradient method, and disparate mistreatment method in terms of the fairness-accuracy trade-off.", "authors": "Xiaobin Song, Zeyuan Liu, Benben Jiang", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "On the Selection of Intermediate Length Representative Periods for Capacity Expansion", "abstract": "As the decarbonization of power systems accelerates, there has been increasing interest in capacity expansion models for their role in guiding this transition. Representative period selection is an important component of capacity expansion modeling, enabling computational tractability of optimization while ensuring fidelity between the representative periods and the full year. However, little attention has been devoted to selecting representative periods longer than a single day. This prevents the capacity expansion model from directly simulating interday energy sharing, which is of key importance as energy generation becomes more variable and storage more important. To this end, we propose a novel method for selecting representative periods of any length. The method is validated using a capacity expansion model and production cost model based on California's decarbonization goals.

This results in a reduced model quality. In this contribution, we show that these three normalization tasks are inherently coupled. Due to the existence of this coupling, we propose a solution to all three normalization challenges by introducing a normalization constant at the state derivative level. We show that the appropriate choice of the normalization constant is related to the dynamics of the to-be-identified system and we derive multiple methods of obtaining an effective normalization constant.

Here we explore how prediction may lie at the core of brain function by considering a neuron predicting the future of a scalar time series input. Assuming that the dynamics of the lag vector (a vector composed of several consecutive elements of the time series) are locally linear, Normal Mode Decomposition decomposes the dynamics into independently evolving (eigen-)modes allowing for straightforward prediction. We propose that a neuron learns the top mode and projects its input onto the associated subspace. Under this interpretation, the temporal filter of a neuron corresponds to the left eigenvector of a generalized eigenvalue problem. We mathematically analyze the operation of such an algorithm on noisy observations of synthetic data generated by a linear system. Interestingly, the shape of the temporal filter varies with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): a noisy input yields a monophasic filter and a growing SNR leads to multiphasic filters with progressively greater number of phases. Such variation in the temporal filter with input SNR resembles that observed experimentally in biological neurons.", "authors": "Siavash Golkar, Jules Berman, David Lipshutz, Robert Mihai Haret, Tim Gollisch, Dmitri B.

{"title": "Modeling AoII in Push- and Pull-Based Sampling of Continuous Time Markov Chains", "abstract": "Age of incorrect information (AoII) has recently been proposed as an alternative to existing information freshness metrics for real-time sampling and estimation problems involving information sources that are tracked by remote monitors. Different from existing metrics, AoII penalizes the incorrect information by increasing linearly with time as long as the source and the monitor are de-synchronized, and is reset when they are synchronized back. While AoII has generally been investigated for discrete time information sources, we develop a novel analytical model in this paper for push- and pull-based sampling and transmission of a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) process. In the pull-based model, the sensor starts transmitting information on the observed CTMC only when a pull request from the monitor is received. On the other hand, in the push-based scenario, the sensor, being aware of the AoII process, samples and transmits when the AoII process exceeds a random threshold. The proposed analytical model for both scenarios is based on the construction of a discrete time MC (DTMC) making state transitions at the embedded epochs of synchronization points, using the theory of absorbing CTMCs, and in particular phase-type distributions. For a given sampling policy, analytical models to obtain the mean AoII and the average sampling rate are developed.

Specifically, a weighted sum of predicted posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) for object relative position and velocity estimation is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory, where an efficient solution is obtained based on the successive convex approximation method. Furthermore, under a special case with the measurement mean square error (MSE), the optimal relative motion state is obtained and proved to keep a fixed elevation angle and zero relative velocity. Numerical results validate that the obtained solution to the predicted PCRB minimization can be approximated by the optimal relative motion state when predicted measurement MSE dominates the predicted PCRBs, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme.

Specifically, exponential input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system with respect to disturbances is achieved in this paper, which is superior to some existing results that only guarantee a practical exponential ISS property. The dynamic ETM is easy-to-implement in practical operation since all designed parameters are determined only by a simple data-driven linear matrix inequality (LMI), without additional complicated conditions as required in relevant literature. As quantization is the most common signal constraint in practice, the developed control scheme is further extended to the case where state transmission is affected by a uniform or logarithmic quantization effect. Finally, adequate simulations are performed to show the validity and superiority of the proposed control schemes.", "authors": "Tao Xu, Zhiyong Sun, Guanghui Wen, Zhisheng Duan", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Distributed Learning and Function Fusion in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space", "abstract": "We consider the problem of function estimation by a multi-agent system comprising of two agents and a fusion center. Each agent receives data comprising of samples of an independent variable (input) and the corresponding values of the dependent variable (output). The data remains local and is not shared with other members in the system. The objective of the system is to collaboratively estimate the function from the input to the output. To this end, we develop an iterative distributed algorithm for this function estimation problem. Each agent solves a local estimation problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and uploads the function to the fusion center. At the fusion center, the functions are fused by first estimating the data points that would have generated the uploaded functions and then subsequently solving a least squares estimation problem using the estimated data from both functions. The fused function is downloaded by the agents and is subsequently used for estimation at the next iteration along with incoming data. This procedure is executed sequentially and stopped when the difference between consecutively estimated functions becomes small enough. To analyze the algorithm, we define learning operators for the agents, fusion center and the system. We study the asymptotic properties of the norm of the learning operators and find sufficient conditions under which they converge to $1$. Given a sequence of data points, we define and prove the existence of the learning operator for the system. We prove that the porposed learning algorithm is consistent and demonstrate the same using an example.

To tackle this challenging problem, we treat the schedulability analysis as a black box that only returns true/false results. We propose a general and scalable framework to optimize real-time systems, named Numerical Optimizer with Real-Time Highlight (NORTH). NORTH is built upon the gradient-based active-set methods from the numerical optimization literature but with new methods to manage active constraints for the non-differentiable schedulability constraints. In addition, we also generalize NORTH to NORTH+, to collaboratively optimize certain types of discrete variables (\\eg priority assignments, categorical variables) with continuous variables based on numerical optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the algorithm performance with two example applications: energy minimization based on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and optimization of control system performance. In these experiments, NORTH achieved $10^2$ to $10^5$ times speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar or better solution quality.

The tool serves to (i) construct IMCs/IMDPs as finite abstractions of underlying original systems, and (ii) leverage interval iteration algorithms for formal verification and controller synthesis over infinite-horizon properties, including safety, reachability, and reach-avoid, while offering convergence guarantees. IMPaCT is developed in C++ and designed using AdaptiveCpp, an independent open-source implementation of SYCL, for adaptive parallelism over CPUs and GPUs of all hardware vendors, including Intel and NVIDIA. IMPaCT stands as the first software tool for the parallel construction of IMCs/IMDPs, empowered with the capability to leverage high-performance computing platforms and cloud computing services. Specifically, parallelism offered by IMPaCT effectively addresses the challenges arising from the state-explosion problem inherent in discretization-based techniques applied to large-scale stochastic systems. We benchmark IMPaCT on several physical case studies, adopted from the ARCH tool competition for stochastic models, including a 2-dimensional robot, a 3-dimensional autonomous vehicle, a 5-dimensional room temperature system, and a 7-dimensional building automation system.

{"title": "To Balance or to Not? Battery Aging-Aware Active Cell Balancing for Electric Vehicles", "abstract": "Due to manufacturing variabilities and temperature gradients within an electric vehicle's battery pack, the capacities of cells in it decrease differently over time. This reduces the usable capacity of the battery - the charge levels of one or more cells might be at the minimum threshold while most of the other cells have residual charge. Active cell balancing (i.e., transferring charge among cells) can equalize their charge levels, thereby increasing the battery pack's usable capacity. But performing balancing means additional charge transfer, which can result in energy loss and cell aging, akin to memory aging in storage technologies due to writing. This paper studies when cell balancing should be optimally triggered to minimize aging while maintaining the necessary driving capability. In particular, we propose optimization strategies for cell balancing while minimizing their impact on aging. By borrowing terminology from the storage domain, we refer to this as \"wear leveling-aware\" active balancing.", "authors": "Enrico Fraccaroli, Seongik Jang, Logan Stach, Hoeseok Yang, Sangyoung Park, Samarjit Chakraborty", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},

If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process.

To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner.

{"title": "Low-Complexity Control for a Class of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Generalized Time-Varying Output Constraints", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel control framework for addressing the satisfaction of multiple time-varying output constraints in uncertain high-order MIMO nonlinear control systems. Unlike existing methods, which often assume that the constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can handle coupled time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential infeasibilities. First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints essentially boils down to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable, representing the signed distance from the boundary of the time-varying output-constrained set. To achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is designed that, when satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the time-varying output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a novel robust and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the satisfaction of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a mechanism for online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a least violating solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for some time.

The epidemic spreading process is described by a susceptible-infected-vigilant (SIV) model, which introduces opinion-dependent epidemic vigilance state compared with the classical epidemic models. The opinion process is modeled by a polar opinion dynamics model, which includes infection prevalence and human stubbornness into the opinion evolution. By introducing an opinion-dependent reproduction number, we analyze the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria and derive sufficient conditions for their global asymptotic stability.

{"title": "Distributed Data-driven Unknown-input Observers", "abstract": "Unknown inputs related to, e.g., sensor aging, modeling errors, or device bias, represent a major concern in wireless sensor networks, as they degrade the state estimation performance. To improve the performance, unknown-input observers (UIOs) have been proposed. Most of the results available to design UIOs are based on explicit system models, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in real-world applications. Data-driven techniques, on the other hand, have become a viable alternative for the design and analysis of unknown systems using only data. In this context, a novel data-driven distributed unknown-input observer (D-DUIO) for an unknown linear system is developed, which leverages solely some data collected offline, without any prior knowledge of the system matrices. In the paper, first, the design of a DUIO is investigated by resorting to a traditional model-based approach. By resorting to a Lyapunov equation, it is proved that under some conditions, the state estimates at all nodes of the DUIO achieve consensus and collectively converge to the state of the system. Moving to a data-driven approach, it is shown that the input/output/state trajectories of the system are compatible with the equations of a D-DUIO, and this allows, under suitable assumptions, to express the matrices of a possible DUIO in terms of the matrices of pre-collected data. Then, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed D-DUIO are given.

In both demonstrations, the actuators are controlled by internal fluidic pressure. Capacitive sensors patterned onto the robot provide position estimation and serve as input to a feedback controller. We demonstrate position control of a single actuator during stepped setpoints and sinusoidal trajectory following, with root mean square error (RMSE) below 4 mm.

Such systems have a trapping region if all trajectories eventually converge to and stay within a bounded set.

However, prior solutions have used non-convex optimization methods, resulting in conservative estimates. In this paper, we build on this prior work and provide a convex semidefinite programming condition for the existence of a trapping region. The condition allows precise verification or falsification of the existence of a trapping region. If a trapping region exists, then we provide a second semidefinite program to compute the least conservative trapping region in the form of a ball.

Unmodeled aerodynamic drag forces from carried payloads can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Prior work model aerodynamic effects as residual dynamics or external disturbances in the control problem leading to a reactive policy that could be catastrophic. Moreover, redesigning controllers and tuning control gains on hardware platforms is a laborious effort. In this paper, we argue that adapting the trajectory generation component keeping the controller fixed can improve trajectory tracking for quadrotor systems experiencing drag forces. To achieve this, we formulate a drag-aware planning problem by applying a suitable relaxation to an optimal quadrotor control problem, introducing a tracking cost function which measures the ability of a controller to follow a reference trajectory. This tracking cost function acts as a regularizer in trajectory generation and is learned from data obtained from simulation. Our experiments in both simulation and on the Crazyflie hardware platform show that changing the planner reduces tracking error by as much as 83%.

The majority of current methodologies are only applicable to a single and specific scenario, predicated on scenario-specific assumptions. Consequently, their application in real-world environments is restricted by the innumerable nature of traffic scenarios. In this study, we propose a unified optimization approach that exhibits the potential to address cooperative decision-making problems related to traffic scenarios with generic road topologies. This development is grounded in the premise that the topologies of various traffic scenarios can be universally represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Particularly, the reference paths and time profiles for all involved CAVs are determined in a fully cooperative manner, taking into account factors such as velocities, accelerations, conflict resolutions, and overall traffic efficiency. The cooperative decision-making of CAVs is approximated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem building on the DAGs of road topologies. This favorably facilitates the use of standard numerical solvers and the global optimality can be attained through the optimization. Case studies corresponding to different multi-lane traffic scenarios featuring diverse topologies are scheduled as the test itineraries, and the efficacy of our proposed methodology is corroborated.", "authors": "Zhenmin Huang, Shaojie Shen, Jun Ma", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

A quick and accurate diagnosis is crucial to increase the chance of survival. However, in medical analysis, the manual annotation and segmentation of a brain tumor can be a complicated task. Multiple MRI modalities are typically analyzed as they provide unique information regarding the tumor regions. Although these MRI modalities are helpful for segmenting gliomas, they tend to increase overfitting and computation. This paper proposes a region of interest detection algorithm that is implemented during data preprocessing to locate salient features and remove extraneous MRI data. This decreases the input size, allowing for more aggressive data augmentations and deeper neural networks. Following the preprocessing of the MRI modalities, a fully convolutional autoencoder with soft attention segments the different brain MRIs. When these deep learning algorithms are implemented in practice, analysts and physicians cannot differentiate between accurate and inaccurate predictions.

The residuals in the implicit system of equations can be related to the NN's prediction error, hence, we can provide an error estimate at several points along a trajectory. We find that this error estimate highly correlates with the NN's prediction error and that increasing the order of the IRK method improves this estimate.

This paper covers both aspects by proposing (i) a federeted extended Kalman filter (FEKF), and (ii) a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) path tracking controller trained via an expert demonstrator to expedite the learning phase and increase robustess to the simulation-to-reality gap. The paper also presents the formulation of a vehicle model along with an effective yet simple procedure for identifying tis paramters. The experimentally validated model is used for (i) supporting the design of the FEKF and (ii) serving as a digital twin for training the proposed DRL-based path tracking algorithm. Experimental results confirm the ability of the FEKF to improve the estimate of the mobile robot's position. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the DRL path tracking strateguy is experimentally tested along manoeuvres not considered during training, showing also the ability of the AI-based solution to outpeform model-based control strategies and the demonstrator.

Existing techniques typically employ highly complex model structures which result in large model sizes and slow inference speeds. This often leads to high energy consumption and restricts their adoption for practical applications. To address this issue, this work employs a three-stage workflow for compressing deep SR models which significantly reduces their memory requirement. Restoration performance has been maintained through teacher-student knowledge distillation using a newly designed distillation loss. We have applied this approach to two popular image super-resolution networks, SwinIR and EDSR, to demonstrate its effectiveness. The resulting compact models, SwinIRmini and EDSRmini, attain an 89% and 96% reduction in both model size and floating-point operations (FLOPs) respectively, compared to their original versions.

Mitigating this concern necessitates the deployment and optimization of network energy-saving solutions, such as carrier shutdown, to dynamically manage network resources. Traditional optimization approaches encounter complexity due to factors like the large number of cells, stochastic traffic, channel variations, and intricate trade-offs. This paper introduces the simulated reality of communication networks (SRCON) framework, a novel, data-driven modeling paradigm that harnesses live network data and employs a blend of machine learning (ML)- and expert-based models. These mix of models accurately characterizes the functioning of network components, and predicts network energy efficiency and user equipment (UE) quality of service for any energy carrier shutdown configuration in a specific network. Distinguishing itself from existing methods, SRCON eliminates the reliance on expensive expert knowledge, drive testing, or incomplete maps for predicting network performance. This paper details the pipeline employed by SRCON to decompose the large network energy efficiency modeling problem into ML and expert-based submodels. It demonstrates how, by embracing stochasticity, and carefully crafting the relationship between such submodels, the overall computational complexity can be reduced and prediction accuracy enhanced. Results derived from real network data underscore the paradigm shift introduced by SRCON, showcasing significant gains over a state-of-the art method used by a operator for network energy efficiency modeling.

Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\\ell^1$-prior.

Moreover, the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of speech have been ignored. In this paper, we propose a feature enhancement algorithm for dysarthria speech called WHFEMD. It combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) to enhance features. With the proposed algorithm, the fast Fourier transform of the dysarthria speech is first performed and then followed by EMD to get intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). After that, FWHT is used to output new coefficients and to extract statistical features based on IMFs, power spectral density, and enhanced gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted experiments on two public pathological speech databases including UA Speech and TORGO. The results show that our algorithm performed better than traditional features in classification. We achieved improvements of 13.8% (UA Speech) and 3.84% (TORGO), respectively. Furthermore, the incorporation of an imbalanced classification algorithm to address data imbalance has resulted in a 12.18% increase in recognition accuracy.

Building a universal US foundation model holds the potential to address these issues. Nevertheless, the development of such foundational models encounters intrinsic challenges in US analysis, i.e., insufficient databases, low quality, and ineffective features. In this paper, we present a universal US foundation model, named USFM, generalized to diverse tasks and organs towards label efficient US image analysis. First, a large-scale Multi-organ, Multi-center, and Multi-device US database was built, comprehensively containing over two million US images. Organ-balanced sampling was employed for unbiased learning. Then, USFM is self-supervised pre-trained on the sufficient US database. To extract the effective features from low-quality US images, we proposed a spatial-frequency dual masked image modeling method. A productive spatial noise addition-recovery approach was designed to learn meaningful US information robustly, while a novel frequency band-stop masking learning approach was also employed to extract complex, implicit grayscale distribution and textural variations. Extensive experiments were conducted on the various tasks of segmentation, classification, and image enhancement from diverse organs and diseases. Comparisons with representative US image analysis models illustrate the universality and effectiveness of USFM.

{"title": "Acceleration Estimation of Signal Propagation Path Length Changes for Wireless Sensing", "abstract": "As indoor applications grow in diversity, wireless sensing, vital in areas like localization and activity recognition, is attracting renewed interest. Indoor wireless sensing relies on signal processing, particularly channel state information (CSI) based signal parameter estimation. Nonetheless, regarding reflected signals induced by dynamic human targets, no satisfactory algorithm yet exists for estimating the acceleration of dynamic path length change (DPLC), which is crucial for various sensing tasks in this context. Hence, this paper proposes DP-AcE, a CSI-based DPLC acceleration estimation algorithm. We first model the relationship between the phase difference of adjacent CSI measurements and the DPLC's acceleration. Unlike existing works assuming constant velocity, DP-AcE considers both velocity and acceleration, yielding a more accurate and objective representation. Using this relationship, an algorithm combining scaling with Fourier transform is proposed to realize acceleration estimation. We evaluate DP-AcE via the acceleration estimation and acceleration-based fall detection with the collected CSI. Experimental results reveal that, using distance as the metric, DP-AcE achieves a median acceleration estimation percentage error of 4.38%. Furthermore, in multi-target scenarios, the fall detection achieves an average true positive rate of 89.56% and a false positive rate of 11.78%, demonstrating its importance in enhancing indoor wireless sensing capabilities.", "authors": "Jiacheng Wang, Hongyang Du, Dusit Niyato, Mu Zhou, Jiawen Kang, H.

The severity of hip OA is often classified using the Crowe and Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classifications. However, as the classification is subjective, we aimed to develop an automated approach to classify the disease severity based on the two grades using digitally-reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CT images. Automatic grading of the hip OA severity was performed using deep learning-based models. The models were trained to predict the disease grade using two grading schemes, i.e., predicting the Crowe and KL grades separately, and predicting a new ordinal label combining both grades and representing the disease progression of hip OA. The models were trained in classification and regression settings. In addition, the model uncertainty was estimated and validated as a predictor of classification accuracy. The models were trained and validated on a database of 197 hip OA patients, and externally validated on 52 patients. The model accuracy was evaluated using exact class accuracy (ECA), one-neighbor class accuracy (ONCA), and balanced accuracy.The deep learning models produced a comparable accuracy of approximately 0.65 (ECA) and 0.95 (ONCA) in the classification and regression settings. The model uncertainty was significantly larger in cases with large classification errors (P<6e-3). In this study, an automatic approach for grading hip OA severity from CT images was developed. The models have shown comparable performance with high ONCA, which facilitates automated grading in large-scale CT databases and indicates the potential for further disease progression analysis.

Although several deep learning networks (DNNs) demonstrate promising results in terms of segmentation, they require a substantial quantity of training data in order to produce suitable outcomes. Furthermore, a major issue faced by most of these models is their ability to perform well when faced with unseen classes. To address these challenges, we propose a one-shot learning model for segmenting brain tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, based on a single prototype similarity score. Leveraging the recently developed techniques of few-shot learning, which involve the utilization of support and query sets of images for training and testing purposes, we strive to obtain a definitive tumor region by focusing on slices that contain foreground classes. This approach differs from other recent DNNs that utilize the entire set of images. The training process for this model is carried out iteratively, with each iteration involving the selection of random slices that contain foreground classes from randomly sampled data as the query set, along with a different random slice from the same sample as the support set. In order to distinguish the query images from the class prototypes, we employ a metric learning-based approach that relies on non-parametric thresholds.

{"title": "Nonasymptotic Regret Analysis of Adaptive Linear Quadratic Control with Model Misspecification", "abstract": "The strategy of pre-training a large model on a diverse dataset, then fine-tuning for a particular application has yielded impressive results in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic control. This strategy has vast potential in adaptive control, where it is necessary to rapidly adapt to changing conditions with limited data. Toward concretely understanding the benefit of pre-training for adaptive control, we study the adaptive linear quadratic control problem in the setting where the learner has prior knowledge of a collection of basis matrices for the dynamics. This basis is misspecified in the sense that it cannot perfectly represent the dynamics of the underlying data generating process. We propose an algorithm that uses this prior knowledge, and prove upper bounds on the expected regret after $T$ interactions with the system. In the regime where $T$ is small, the upper bounds are dominated by a term scales with either $\\texttt{poly}(\\log T)$ or $\\sqrt{T}$, depending on the prior knowledge available to the learner. When $T$ is large, the regret is dominated by a term that grows with $\\delta T$, where $\\delta$ quantifies the level of misspecification. This linear term arises due to the inability to perfectly estimate the underlying dynamics using the misspecified basis, and is therefore unavoidable unless the basis matrices are also adapted online. However, it only dominates for large $T$, after the sublinear terms arising due to the error in estimating the weights for the basis matrices become negligible. We provide simulations that validate our analysis. Our simulations also show that offline data from a collection of related systems can be used as part of a pre-training stage to estimate a misspecified dynamics basis, which is in turn used by our adaptive controller.", "authors": "Bruce D.

We observed a softening of one polar phonon in the THz range on cooling towards 460 and 300 K, i.e., temperatures at which $BiMn_{7}O_{12}$ undergoes subsequent structural phase transitions from monoclinic $\\textit{I2/m}$ to polar monoclinic $\\textit{Im}$ and triclinic $\\textit{P1}$ phases. The soft phonon causes dielectric anomalies typical for displacive ferroelectric phase transitions. Microwave measurements performed at 5.8 GHz up to 400 K qualitatively confirmed not only the dielectric anomaly at 300 K, but also revealed two other weak dielectric anomalies near the magnetic phase transitions at 60 K and 28 K. This evidences the multiferroic nature of the low-temperature phases, although the relatively high conductivity in the kHz and Hz spectral range prevented us from directly measuring the permittivity and ferroelectric polarization. Some Raman modes sense the magnetic phase transitions occurring near 60 and 25 K, showing that spin-phonon coupling is relevant in this compound and in this temperature range. The deviation of the Mn-O stretching mode frequency from the anharmonic temperature behavior was successfully explained by the spin correlation function calculated from the magnetic contribution to the specific heat.", "authors": "A.

For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA. Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio description of the material's electronic structure determines both aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometry Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$, including $X = $ Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal $\\mathrm{L}1_0$ order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted MCA.", "authors": "Christopher D.

{"title": "Microwave-assisted synthesis of LaMnO3+d: Tuning physical properties with microwave power", "abstract": "Synthesis of transition metal oxides by microwave irradiation is a faster and energy-saving method compared to conventional heating in an electrical furnace because microwave energy is directly converted into heat within precursors. However, not much is known about how the physical properties are modified by the power of microwaves. We synthesized LaMnO3+d by irradiating oxide precursors with microwaves and studied the impact of microwave power (P = 1000 W, 1200 W, 1400 W and 1600 W) on magnetism, resistivity, magnetoresistance, thermopower, magnetic entropy change, magnetostriction, and electron spin resonance. It is found that paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition becomes sharper, saturation magnetization increases, and electrical resistivity at low temperatures dramatically decreases as P increases. While the resistivity of samples irradiated with MW power of P less than or equal to 1400 W show insulating-like behavior down to 50 K, an insulator-metal transition occurs in the sample exposed to P = 1600 W and this sample also shows a maximum magnetoresistance (= -55%), magneto-thermopower (=-87%), magnetostriction (-180 x10-6) for H = 50 kOe and magnetic entropy change of 4.78 J/kg. K for H = 30 kOe around the Curie temperature. The intensity of electron spin resonance spectra at 300 K increases with P. We postulate that the much enhanced physical properties observed for the P = 1600 W sample arise from the creation of higher hole density, chemical homogeneity, and increased grain size.

{"title": "From anti-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in a dislocation-obstacle bypass: Atomistic Simulations and Theoretical Investigation", "abstract": "Dislocations are the primary carriers of plasticity in metallic material. Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations, we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress. More work needs to be performed to fully understand the discrepancies between Schoeck's and PAFI results compared to molecular dynamics.", "authors": "Mohammadhossein Nahavandian, Soumit Sarkar, Soumendu Bagchi, Danny Perez, Enrique Martinez", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Multivariate Extreme Value Theory Based Channel Modeling for Ultra-Reliable Communications", "abstract": "Attaining ultra-reliable communication (URC) in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks requires deriving statistics of channel in ultra-reliable region by modeling the extreme events.

In this paper, we propose a multivariate EVT (MEVT)-based channel modeling methodology for tail of the joint distribution of multi-channel by characterizing the multivariate extremes of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The proposed approach derives lower tail statistics of received power of each channel by using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Then, tail of the joint distribution is modeled as a function of estimated GPD parameters based on two approaches: logistic distribution, which utilizes logistic distribution to determine dependency factors among the Frechet transformed tail sequence and obtain a bi-variate extreme value model, and Poisson point process, which estimates probability measure function of the Pickands angular component to model bi-variate extreme values. Finally, validity of the proposed models is assessed by incorporating the mean constraint on probability measure function of Pichanks coordinates. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the superiority of proposed methodology compared to the conventional extrapolation-based methods in providing the best fit to the multivariate extremes.", "authors": "Niloofar Mehrnia, Sinem Coleri", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

The first one is the standard Sinusoidal Model (SM), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The second is the Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Model (EDSM) which has been proposed in the last decade, and utilizes a subspace method for parameter estimation, and finally the extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model (eaQHM), which has been recently proposed for AM-FM decomposition, and estimates the signal parameters using Least Squares on a set of basis function that are adaptive to the local characteristics of the signal. The parameter estimation of each model is briefly described and its performance is compared to the others in terms of signal reconstruction accuracy versus window size on a variety of synthetic signals and versus the number of sinusoids on real signals. The latter include highly non stationary signals, such as singing voices and guitar solos. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are presented via synthetic signals and then the application on real signals is discussed. Conclusively, eaQHM outperforms EDS in medium-to-large window size analysis, whereas EDSM yields higher reconstruction values for smaller analysis window sizes. Thus, a future research direction appears to be the merge of adaptivity of the eaQHM and parameter estimation robustness of the EDSM in a new paradigm for high-quality analysis and resynthesis of general audio signals.", "authors": "George P.

{"title": "Integrated Cyber-Physical Resiliency for Power Grids under IoT-Enabled Dynamic Botnet Attacks", "abstract": "The wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy devices improves the quality of life, but simultaneously, it enlarges the attack surface of the power grid system. The adversary can gain illegitimate control of a large number of these devices and use them as a means to compromise the physical grid operation, a mechanism known as the IoT botnet attack. This paper aims to improve the resiliency of cyber-physical power grids to such attacks. Specifically, we use an epidemic model to understand the dynamic botnet formation, which facilitates the assessment of the cyber layer vulnerability of the grid. The attacker aims to exploit this vulnerability to enable a successful physical compromise, while the system operator's goal is to ensure a normal operation of the grid by mitigating cyber risks. We develop a cross-layer game-theoretic framework for strategic decision-making to enhance cyber-physical grid resiliency. The cyber-layer game guides the system operator on how to defend against the botnet attacker as the first layer of defense, while the dynamic game strategy at the physical layer further counteracts the adversarial behavior in real time for improved physical resilience.

{"title": "Sensor Placement for Learning in Flow Networks", "abstract": "Large infrastructure networks (e.g. for transportation and power distribution) require constant monitoring for failures, congestion, and other adversarial events. However, assigning a sensor to every link in the network is often infeasible due to placement and maintenance costs. Instead, sensors can be placed only on a few key links, and machine learning algorithms can be leveraged for the inference of missing measurements (e.g. traffic counts, power flows) across the network. This paper investigates the sensor placement problem for networks. We first formalize the problem under a flow conservation assumption and show that it is NP-hard to place a fixed set of sensors optimally. Next, we propose an efficient and adaptive greedy heuristic for sensor placement that scales to large networks. Our experiments, using datasets from real-world application domains, show that the proposed approach enables more accurate inference than existing alternatives from the literature.

{"title": "Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Microphone Array Processing for Moving Humanoid Robots", "abstract": "The auditory system of humanoid robots has gained increased attention in recent years. This system typically acquires the surrounding sound field by means of a microphone array. Signals acquired by the array are then processed using various methods. One of the widely applied methods is direction of arrival estimation. The conventional direction of arrival estimation methods assume that the array is fixed at a given position during the estimation. However, this is not necessarily true for an array installed on a moving humanoid robot. The array motion, if not accounted for appropriately, can introduce a significant error in the estimated direction of arrival. The current paper presents a signal model that takes the motion into account. Based on this model, two processing methods are proposed. The first one compensates for the motion of the robot. The second method is applicable to periodic signals and utilizes the motion in order to enhance the performance to a level beyond that of a stationary array. Numerical simulations and an experimental study are provided, demonstrating that the motion compensation method almost eliminates the motion-related error. It is also demonstrated that by using the motion-based enhancement method it is possible to improve the direction of arrival estimation performance, as compared to that obtained when using a stationary array.", "authors": "Vladimir Tourbabin, Boaz Rafaely", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Train-Free Segmentation in MRI with Cubical Persistent Homology", "abstract": "We describe a new general method for segmentation in MRI scans using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. It works in three steps, first identifying the whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the various components of the segmentation. Although convoking classical ideas of TDA, such an algorithm has never been proposed separately from deep learning methods. To achieve this, our approach takes into account, in addition to the homology of the image, the localization of representative cycles, a piece of information that seems never to have been exploited in this context. In particular, it offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for large annotated data sets. TDA also provides a more interpretable and stable framework for segmentation by explicitly mapping topological features to segmentation components. By adapting the geometric object to be detected, the algorithm can be adjusted to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We carefully study the examples of glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a sphere is to be detected, as well as myocardium in cardiac MRI, involving a cylinder, and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are circles.

The use of mmWave for various applications including vehicular communications has been extensively discussed. However, applying mmWave to vehicular communications faces challenges of high mobility nodes and narrow coverage along the mmWave beams. Due to high mobility in dense networks, overlapping beams can cause strong interference which leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, beam switching capability in mmWave can be utilized. Then, frequent beam switching and cell change become inevitable to manage interference, which increase computational and signalling complexity. In order to deal with the complexity in interference control, we develop a new strategy called Multi-Agent Context Learning (MACOL), which utilizes Contextual Bandit to manage interference while allocating mmWave beams to serve vehicles in the network. Our approach demonstrates that by leveraging knowledge of neighbouring beam status, the machine learning agent can identify and avoid potential interfering transmissions to other ongoing transmissions.

Microphone arrays have been employed for spatial analyses with an important objective being the estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of direct sound and early room reflections using room impulse responses (RIRs). An optimal method for DOA estimation is the multiple signal classification algorithm. When RIRs are considered, this method typically fails due to the correlation of room reflections, which leads to rank deficiency of the cross-spectrum matrix. Preprocessing methods for rank restoration, which may involve averaging over frequency, for example, have been proposed exclusively for spherical arrays. However, these methods fail in the case of reflections with equal time delays, which may arise in practice and could be of interest. In this paper, a method is proposed for systems that combine a spherical microphone array and a spherical loudspeaker array, referred to as multiple-input multiple-output systems. This method, referred to as modal smoothing, exploits the additional spatial diversity for rank restoration and succeeds where previous methods fail, as demonstrated in a simulation study.

To address this issue, we propose a reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-aided SLAM system in this paper. The RHS is a novel type of low-cost antenna that can cut down the hardware cost by replacing phased arrays in conventional SLAM systems. However, compared with a phased array where the phase shifts of parallelfed signals are adjusted, the RHS exhibits a different radiation model because its amplitude-controlled radiation elements are series-fed by surface waves, implying that traditional schemes cannot be applied directly. To address this challenge, we propose an RHS-aided beam steering method for sensing the surrounding environment and design the corresponding SLAM algorithm.

Specifically, we design a complex-domain multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer (CMixer), which utilizes two kinds of complex-domain MLP modules to learn the space and frequency characteristics respectively and then interleaves them to couple the learned properties. The complex-domain computation facilitates the learning on the complex-valued channel data, while the interleaving tightens the coupling of space and frequency domains. These two designs jointly reduce the learning burden, making the physics-inspired CMixer more effective on channel representation learning than existing data-driven approaches. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme brings 4.6~10dB gains in mapping accuracy compared to existing schemes under different settings. Besides, ablation studies show the necessity of complex-domain computation as well as the extent to which the interleaved learning matches the channel properties.", "authors": "Zirui Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Lei Liu", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},

A modified XCMP method based on edge detection was proposed to allow real-time TOFs estimation, then dielectric constant and thickness predictions. Field tests using a multi-channel GPR system were performed for validation. Both the surface reflection and XCMP setups were conducted.

Therefore, the ability to detect tumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep learning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging situations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML) comprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The detection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive tasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and pre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients of each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with real world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the testing, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to Patient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the detection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor region. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both in Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification phase.

Expanding on a free-field assumption, errors are incorporated separately for each array and error bounds are defined, facilitating error analysis for the system. The dependency of the error bounds on the SLA and SMA parameters is studied and it is recommended that parameters should be chosen to assure matched OFRs of the arrays in MIMO system design.

Determining an appropriate transmission strategy that satisfies ultra-reliability constraint necessitates derivation of statistics of channel in ultra-reliable region and, subsequently, integration of these statistics into rate selection while incorporating a confidence interval to account for potential uncertainties that may arise during estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ultra-reliable real-time transmission considering both spatial diversities and ultra-reliable channel statistics based on multivariate extreme value theory. First, tail distribution of joint received power sequences obtained from different receivers is modeled while incorporating inter-relations of extreme events occurring rarely based on Poisson point process approach in MEVT. The optimum transmission strategies are then developed by determining optimum transmission rate based on estimated joint tail distribution and incorporating confidence intervals into estimations to cope with the availability of limited data. Finally, system reliability is assessed by utilizing outage probability metric. Through analysis of data obtained from the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, our study showcases the effectiveness of proposed methodology in surpassing traditional extrapolation-based approaches.

To further improve the reconstruction ability and pitch accuracy to enhance the editability of user-provided sound, we propose HyperGANStrument, which introduces a pitch-invariant hypernetwork to modulate the weights of a pre-trained GANStrument generator, given a one-shot sound as input. The hypernetwork modulation provides feedback for the generator in the reconstruction of the input sound. In addition, we take advantage of an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the hypernetwork to improve the reconstruction fidelity and generation diversity of the generator.

{"title": "On the Target Detection Performance of a Molecular Communication Network with Multiple Mobile Nanomachines", "abstract": "A network of nanomachines (NMs) can be used to build a target detection system for a variety of promising applications. They have the potential to detect toxic chemicals, infectious bacteria, and biomarkers of dangerous diseases such as cancer within the human body. Many diseases and health disorders can be detected early and efficiently treated in the future by utilizing these systems. To fully grasp the potential of these systems, mathematical analysis is required. This paper describes an analytical framework for modeling and analyzing the performance of target detection systems composed of multiple mobile nanomachines of varying sizes with passive/absorbing boundaries. We consider both direct contact detection, in which NMs must physically contact the target to detect it, and indirect sensing, in which NMs must detect the marker molecules emitted by the target. The detection performance of such systems is calculated for degradable and non-degradable targets, as well as mobile and stationary targets. The derived expressions provide various insights, such as the effect of NM density and target degradation on detection probability.", "authors": "Nithin V. Sabu, Abhishek K.

{"title": "SonicVisionLM: Playing Sound with Vision Language Models", "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production. However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations. In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models. Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs). When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content. This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models. To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.

{"title": "Optimal Transcoding Resolution Prediction for Efficient Per-Title Bitrate Ladder Estimation", "abstract": "Adaptive video streaming requires efficient bitrate ladder construction to meet heterogeneous network conditions and end-user demands. Per-title optimized encoding typically traverses numerous encoding parameters to search the Pareto-optimal operating points for each video. Recently, researchers have attempted to predict the content-optimized bitrate ladder for pre-encoding overhead reduction. However, existing methods commonly estimate the encoding parameters on the Pareto front and still require subsequent pre-encodings. In this paper, we propose to directly predict the optimal transcoding resolution at each preset bitrate for efficient bitrate ladder construction. We adopt a Temporal Attentive Gated Recurrent Network to capture spatial-temporal features and predict transcoding resolutions as a multi-task classification problem. We demonstrate that content-optimized bitrate ladders can thus be efficiently determined without any pre-encoding. Our method well approximates the ground-truth bitrate-resolution pairs with a slight Bjøntegaard Delta rate loss of 1.21% and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art fixed ladder.", "authors": "Jinhai Yang, Mengxi Guo, Shijie Zhao, Junlin Li, Li Zhang", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

Under high mobility channels with multiple lags and multiple Doppler-shifts (MLMD), the signal suffers doubly selective (DS) fadings in time and frequency domain, and data symbols modulated on orthogonal chirps are interfered by each other. To address the problem of symbol detection of OCDM over MLMD channel, under the assumption that path attenuation factors, delays, and Doppler shifts of the channel are available, we first derive the closed-form channel matrix in Fresnel domain, and then propose a low-complexity method to approximate it as a sparse matrix. Based on the approximated Fresnel-domain channel, we propose a message passing (MP) based detector to estimate the transmit symbols iteratively. Finally, under two MLMD channels (an underspread channel for terrestrial vehicular communication, and an overspread channel for narrow-band underwater acoustic communications), Monte Carlo simulation results and analysis are provided to validate its advantages as a promising detector for OCDM.", "authors": "Yun Liu, Fei Ji, Miaowen Wen, Hua Qing", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A Change Point Detection Integrated Remaining Useful Life Estimation Model under Variable Operating Conditions", "abstract": "By informing the onset of the degradation process, health status evaluation serves as a significant preliminary step for reliable remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of complex equipment. This paper proposes a novel temporal dynamics learning-based model for detecting change points of individual devices, even under variable operating conditions, and utilises the learnt change points to improve the RUL estimation accuracy. During offline model development, the multivariate sensor data are decomposed to learn fused temporal correlation features that are generalisable and representative of normal operation dynamics across multiple operating conditions. Monitoring statistics and control limit thresholds for normal behaviour are dynamically constructed from these learnt temporal features for the unsupervised detection of device-level change points. The detected change points then inform the degradation data labelling for training a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based RUL estimation model. During online monitoring, the temporal correlation dynamics of a query device is monitored for breach of the control limit derived in offline training. If a change point is detected, the device's RUL is estimated with the well-trained offline model for early preventive action. Using C-MAPSS turbofan engines as the case study, the proposed method improved the accuracy by 5.6\\% and 7.5\\% for two scenarios with six operating conditions, when compared to existing LSTM-based RUL estimation models that do not consider heterogeneous change points.", "authors": "Anushiya Arunan, Yan Qin, Xiaoli Li, Chau Yuen", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

To learn from multimodal videos effectively, in this work, we propose a novel audio-video recognition approach termed audio video Transformer, AVT, leveraging the effective spatio-temporal representation by the video Transformer to improve action recognition accuracy. For multimodal fusion, simply concatenating multimodal tokens in a cross-modal Transformer requires large computational and memory resources, instead we reduce the cross-modality complexity through an audio-video bottleneck Transformer. To improve the learning efficiency of multimodal Transformer, we integrate self-supervised objectives, i.e., audio-video contrastive learning, audio-video matching, and masked audio and video learning, into AVT training, which maps diverse audio and video representations into a common multimodal representation space. We further propose a masked audio segment loss to learn semantic audio activities in AVT.

{"title": "Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spatial-Temporal Traffic Flow Forecasting", "abstract": "Accurate spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting is crucial in aiding traffic managers in implementing control measures and assisting drivers in selecting optimal travel routes. Traditional deep-learning based methods for traffic flow forecasting typically rely on historical data to train their models, which are then used to make predictions on future data. However, the performance of the trained model usually degrades due to the temporal drift between the historical and future data. To make the model trained on historical data better adapt to future data in a fully online manner, this paper conducts the first study of the online test-time adaptation techniques for spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting problems. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Double Correction by Series Decomposition (ADCSD) method, which first decomposes the output of the trained model into seasonal and trend-cyclical parts and then corrects them by two separate modules during the testing phase using the latest observed data entry by entry. In the proposed ADCSD method, instead of fine-tuning the whole trained model during the testing phase, a lite network is attached after the trained model, and only the lite network is fine-tuned in the testing process each time a data entry is observed. Moreover, to satisfy that different time series variables may have different levels of temporal drift, two adaptive vectors are adopted to provide different weights for different time series variables.

In the first stage, the GAWNO is trained on a dataset of normal operating conditions to learn the underlying data distribution. In the second stage, a reconstruction error-based threshold approach using the trained GAWNO is employed to detect and isolate faults based on the discrepancy values.

In particular, it is assumed that an RIS is near the transmitter vehicle and another RIS is close to the receiver vehicles to provide a wider smart radio environment. Besides, we suppose that the channels between two RISs suffer from the Fisher-Snedecor F fading model. Under this scenario, we first provide the marginal distributions of equivalent channels at the legitimate receiver vehicles by exploiting the central limit theorem (CLT). Then, in order to evaluate the PLS performance of the considered secure communication system, we derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by using the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and the Gaussian quadrature techniques. Moreover, to gain more insights into the secrecy performance, the asymptotic expression of the ASC is obtained.

Existing methods for simultaneous extraction of clean vocals and vocal pitches can be classified into two categories: pipeline methods and naive joint learning methods. However, the efficacy of these methods is limited by the following problems: On the one hand, pipeline methods train models for each task independently, resulting a mismatch between the data distributions at the training and testing time. On the other hand, naive joint learning methods simply add the losses of both tasks, possibly leading to a misalignment between the distinct objectives of each task.

It enables precise and detailed monitoring of operations, facilitating timely detection of potential hazards and efficient management. However, adverse weather conditions, such as atmospheric haziness and precipitation, can have a significant impact on image quality. When the atmosphere contains dense haze or water droplets, the incident light scatters, leading to degraded captured images. This degradation is evident in the form of image blur and reduced contrast, increasing the likelihood of incorrect assessments and interpretations by intelligent imaging systems (IIS). To address the challenge of restoring degraded images in hazy and rainy conditions, this paper proposes a novel multi-view knowledge-guided scene recovery network (termed MvKSR). Specifically, guided filtering is performed on the degraded image to separate high/low-frequency components. Subsequently, an en-decoder-based multi-view feature coarse extraction module (MCE) is used to coarsely extract features from different views of the degraded image. The multi-view feature fine fusion module (MFF) will learn and infer the restoration of degraded images through mixed supervision under different views.

We compute the uplink ergodic throughput of each scheduled user under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and non-orthogonal pilot signals. As maximum-radio combining is deployed locally at the ground gateway and the APs, the uplink ergodic throughput is obtained in a closed-form expression. The analytical results explicitly unveil the effects of channel conditions and pilot contamination on each scheduled user. By maximizing the sum throughput, the system can simultaneously determine scheduled users and perform power allocation based on either a model-based approach with alternating optimization or a learning-based approach with the graph neural network.

However, 30-40% of these trials fail mainly because such studies have inadequate sample sizes, stemming from the inability to obtain accurate initial estimates of average treatment effect parameters. To remove this obstacle from the drug development cycle, we present a new algorithm called Trend-Adaptive Design with a Synthetic-Intervention-Based Estimator (TAD-SIE) that appropriately powers a parallel-group trial, a standard RCT design, by leveraging a state-of-the-art hypothesis testing strategy and a novel trend-adaptive design (TAD). Specifically, TAD-SIE uses SECRETS (Subject-Efficient Clinical Randomized Controlled Trials using Synthetic Intervention) for hypothesis testing, which simulates a cross-over trial in order to boost power; doing so, makes it easier for a trial to reach target power within trial constraints (e.g., sample size limits). To estimate sample sizes, TAD-SIE implements a new TAD tailored to SECRETS given that SECRETS violates assumptions under standard TADs. In addition, our TAD overcomes the ineffectiveness of standard TADs by allowing sample sizes to be increased across iterations without any condition while controlling significance level with futility stopping. On a real-world Phase-3 clinical RCT (i.e., a two-arm parallel-group superiority trial with an equal number of subjects per arm), TAD-SIE reaches typical target operating points of 80% or 90% power and 5% significance level in contrast to baseline algorithms that only get at best 59% power and 4% significance level.", "authors": "Sayeri Lala, Niraj K.

{"title": "Involution Fused ConvNet for Classifying Eye-Tracking Patterns of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder", "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complicated neurological condition which is challenging to diagnose. Numerous studies demonstrate that children diagnosed with autism struggle with maintaining attention spans and have less focused vision. The eye-tracking technology has drawn special attention in the context of ASD since anomalies in gaze have long been acknowledged as a defining feature of autism in general. Deep Learning (DL) approaches coupled with eye-tracking sensors are exploiting additional capabilities to advance the diagnostic and its applications. By learning intricate nonlinear input-output relations, DL can accurately recognize the various gaze and eye-tracking patterns and adjust to the data. Convolutions alone are insufficient to capture the important spatial information in gaze patterns or eye tracking. The dynamic kernel-based process known as involutions can improve the efficiency of classifying gaze patterns or eye tracking data. In this paper, we utilise two different image-processing operations to see how these processes learn eye-tracking patterns. Since these patterns are primarily based on spatial information, we use involution with convolution making it a hybrid, which adds location-specific capability to a deep learning model. Our proposed model is implemented in a simple yet effective approach, which makes it easier for applying in real life. We investigate the reasons why our approach works well for classifying eye-tracking patterns. For comparative analysis, we experiment with two separate datasets as well as a combined version of both. The results show that IC with three involution layers outperforms the previous approaches.", "authors": "Md.

{"title": "Exploiting Storage for Computing: Computation Reuse in Collaborative Edge Computing", "abstract": "Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) is a new edge computing paradigm that enables neighboring edge servers to share computational resources with each other. Although CEC can enhance the utilization of computational resources, it still suffers from resource waste. The primary reason is that end-users from the same area are likely to offload similar tasks to edge servers, thereby leading to duplicate computations. To improve system efficiency, the computation results of previously executed tasks can be cached and then reused by subsequent tasks. However, most existing computation reuse algorithms only consider one edge server, which significantly limits the effectiveness of computation reuse. To address this issue, this paper applies computation reuse in CEC networks to exploit the collaboration among edge servers. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to minimize the overall task response time and decompose it into a caching subproblem and a scheduling subproblem. By analyzing the properties of optimal solutions, we show that the optimal caching decisions can be efficiently searched using the bisection method. For the scheduling subproblem, we utilize projected gradient descent and backtracking to find a local minimum.

While existing adversarial perturbations are primarily applied to uncompressed images or compressed images by the traditional image compression method, i.e., JPEG, limited studies have investigated the robustness of models for image classification in the context of DNN-based image compression. With the rapid evolution of advanced image compression, DNN-based learned image compression has emerged as the promising approach for transmitting images in many security-critical applications, such as cloud-based face recognition and autonomous driving, due to its superior performance over traditional compression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to fully investigate the robustness of a classification system post-processed by learned image compression. To bridge this research gap, we explore the adversarial attack on a new pipeline that targets image classification models that utilize learned image compressors as pre-processing modules.

{"title": "Reliability-Optimized User Admission Control for URLLC Traffic: A Neural Contextual Bandit Approach", "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is the cornerstone for a broad range of emerging services in next-generation wireless networks. URLLC fundamentally relies on the network's ability to proactively determine whether sufficient resources are available to support the URLLC traffic, and thus, prevent so-called cell overloads. Nonetheless, achieving accurate quality-of-service (QoS) predictions for URLLC user equipment (UEs) and preventing cell overloads are very challenging tasks. This is due to dependency of the QoS metrics (latency and reliability) on traffic and channel statistics, users' mobility, and interdependent performance across UEs. In this paper, a new QoS-aware UE admission control approach is developed to proactively estimate QoS for URLLC UEs, prior to associating them with a cell, and accordingly, admit only a subset of UEs that do not lead to a cell overload. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to find an efficient UE admission control policy, cognizant of UEs' QoS requirements and cell-level load dynamics. To solve this problem, a new machine learning based method is proposed that builds on (deep) neural contextual bandits, a suitable framework for dealing with nonlinear bandit problems. In fact, the UE admission controller is treated as a bandit agent that observes a set of network measurements (context) and makes admission control decisions based on context-dependent QoS (reward) predictions.

In order to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs, we formulate a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem under constraints on the per-AP transmit power, quality-of-service rate requirements, maximum fronthaul signalling load, and maximum number of UEs served by each AP. In order to solve the formulated problem efficiently, we propose two different schemes according to the different sizes of the CFmMIMO systems. For small-scale CFmMIMO systems, we present a successive convex approximation (SCA) method to obtain a stationary solution and also develop a learning-based method (JointCFNet) to reduce the computational complexity. For large-scale CFmMIMO systems, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm using accelerated projected gradient (APG) techniques.

Determining the vehicle class, such as the BRDM2 tank, BMP2 tank, BTR60 tank, and BTR70 tank, is crucial, as it can help determine whether the target object is an ally or an enemy. While the ML algorithm provides feedback on the recognized target, the final decision is left to the commanding officers. Therefore, providing detailed information alongside the identified target can significantly impact their actions. This detailed information includes the SAR image features that contributed to the classification, the classification confidence, and the probability of the identified object being classified as a different object type or class. We propose a GNN-based ATR framework that provides the final classified class and outputs the detailed information mentioned above. This is the first study to provide a detailed analysis of the classification class, making final decisions more straightforward. Moreover, our GNN framework achieves an overall accuracy of 99.2\\% when evaluated on the MSTAR dataset, improving over previous state-of-the-art GNN methods.", "authors": "Sasindu Wijeratne, Bingyi Zhang, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna, Carl Busart", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

Meanwhile, the 6G networks will also evolve from the Internet-of-everything to the Internet-of-intelligence with hybrid heterogeneous network architectures. In the future, the interplay between GAI and the 6G will lead to new opportunities, where GAI can learn the knowledge of personalized data from the massive connected 6G end devices, while GAI's powerful generation ability can provide advanced network solutions for 6G network and provide 6G end devices with various AIGC services. However, they seem to be an odd couple, due to the contradiction of data and resources. To achieve a better-coordinated interplay between GAI and 6G, the GAI-native networks (GainNet), a GAI-oriented collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework, is proposed in this paper. By deeply integrating GAI with 6G network design, GainNet realizes the positive closed-loop knowledge flow and sustainable-evolution GAI model optimization. On this basis, the GAI-oriented generic resource orchestration mechanism with integrated sensing, communication, and computing (GaiRom-ISCC) is proposed to guarantee the efficient operation of GainNet. Two simple case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes.

{"title": "Gradient weighting for speaker verification in extremely low Signal-to-Noise Ratio", "abstract": "Speaker verification is hampered by background noise, particularly at extremely low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under 0 dB. It is difficult to suppress noise without introducing unwanted artifacts, which adversely affects speaker verification. We proposed the mechanism called Gradient Weighting (Grad-W), which dynamically identifies and reduces artifact noise during prediction. The mechanism is based on the property that the gradient indicates which parts of the input the model is paying attention to. Specifically, when the speaker network focuses on a region in the denoised utterance but not on the clean counterpart, we consider it artifact noise and assign higher weights for this region during optimization of enhancement. We validate it by training an enhancement model and testing the enhanced utterance on speaker verification. The experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces artifact noise, improving speaker verification across various SNR levels.", "authors": "Yi Ma, Kong Aik Lee, Ville Hautamäki, Meng Ge, Haizhou Li", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order.

To avoid the cost of expensive data acquisition, researchers use the abundant data available on the internet.

Recent works such as CUDA propose solutions to this problem by adding class-wise blurs to make datasets unlearnable, i.e a model can never use the acquired dataset for learning. However these methods often reduce the quality of the data making it useless for practical applications. We introduce PosCUDA, a position based convolution for creating unlearnable audio datasets. PosCUDA uses class-wise convolutions on small patches of audio. The location of the patches are based on a private key for each class, hence the model learns the relations between positional blurs and labels, while failing to generalize.

We demonstrate for improving the analysis of intravoxel incoherent motion imaging (IVIM) magnetic resonance (MR) images, using image denoising and a quantitative approach that does not require imposing specific exponential models. IVIM images were acquired for 13 head-and-neck patients prior to radiotherapy. Of these, 5 patients also had post-radiotherapy scans acquired. Image quality was improved prior to parameter fitting via denoising. For this, we employed neural blind deconvolution, a method of undertaking the ill-posed mathematical problem of blind deconvolution using neural networks. The signal decay curve was then quantified in terms of area under the curve ($AUC$) parameters. Denoised images were assessed in terms of blind image quality metrics, and correlations between their derived parameters in parotid glands with radiotherapy dose levels. We assessed the method's ability to recover artificial pseudokernels which had been applied to denoised images. $AUC$ parameters were compared with the apparent diffusion coefficient ($ADC$), biexponential, and triexponential model parameters, in terms of their correlations with dose, and their relative contributions to the total variance of the dataset, obtained through singular value decomposition. Image denoising resulted in improved blind image quality metrics, and higher correlations between IVIM parameters and dose. $AUC$ parameters were more correlated with dose than traditional IVIM parameters, and captured the highest proportion of the dataset's variance. V This method of describing the signal decay curve with model-independent parameters like the $AUC$, and preprocessing images with denoising techniques, shows potential for improving reproducibility and utility of IVIM imaging.", "authors": "Caleb Sample, Jonn Wu, Haley Clark", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Enhancing Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker TTS with Negated Speaker Representations", "abstract": "Zero-shot multi-speaker TTS aims to synthesize speech with the voice of a chosen target speaker without any fine-tuning. Prevailing methods, however, encounter limitations at adapting to new speakers of out-of-domain settings, primarily due to inadequate speaker disentanglement and content leakage. To overcome these constraints, we propose an innovative negation feature learning paradigm that models decoupled speaker attributes as deviations from the complete audio representation by utilizing the subtraction operation. By eliminating superfluous content information from the speaker representation, our negation scheme not only mitigates content leakage, thereby enhancing synthesis robustness, but also improves speaker fidelity. In addition, to facilitate the learning of diverse speaker attributes, we leverage multi-stream Transformers, which retain multiple hypotheses and instigate a training paradigm akin to ensemble learning. To unify these hypotheses and realize the final speaker representation, we employ attention pooling. Finally, in light of the imperative to generate target text utterances in the desired voice, we adopt adaptive layer normalizations to effectively fuse the previously generated speaker representation with the target text representations, as opposed to mere concatenation of the text and audio modalities.

While ganglion cell firings can be predicted via data-trained deep neural nets, the networks remain indecipherable, thus providing little understanding of the cells' underlying operations. To extract knowledge from the cell firings, in this paper we learn an interpretable graph-based classifier from data to predict the firings of ganglion cells in response to visual stimuli. Specifically, we learn a positive semi-definite (PSD) metric matrix $\\mathbf{M} \\succeq 0$ that defines Mahalanobis distances between graph nodes (visual events) endowed with pre-computed feature vectors; the computed inter-node distances lead to edge weights and a combinatorial graph that is amenable to binary classification. Mathematically, we define the objective of metric matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ optimization using a graph adaptation of large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), which is rewritten as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. We solve it efficiently via a fast approximation called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA) linearization.

{"title": "Shrinking Your TimeStep: Towards Low-Latency Neuromorphic Object Recognition with Spiking Neural Network", "abstract": "Neuromorphic object recognition with spiking neural networks (SNNs) is the cornerstone of low-power neuromorphic computing. However, existing SNNs suffer from significant latency, utilizing 10 to 40 timesteps or more, to recognize neuromorphic objects. At low latencies, the performance of existing SNNs is drastically degraded. In this work, we propose the Shrinking SNN (SSNN) to achieve low-latency neuromorphic object recognition without reducing performance. Concretely, we alleviate the temporal redundancy in SNNs by dividing SNNs into multiple stages with progressively shrinking timesteps, which significantly reduces the inference latency. During timestep shrinkage, the temporal transformer smoothly transforms the temporal scale and preserves the information maximally. Moreover, we add multiple early classifiers to the SNN during training to mitigate the mismatch between the surrogate gradient and the true gradient, as well as the gradient vanishing/exploding, thus eliminating the performance degradation at low latency. Extensive experiments on neuromorphic datasets, CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech101, and DVS-Gesture have revealed that SSNN is able to improve the baseline accuracy by 6.55% ~ 21.41%. With only 5 average timesteps and without any data augmentation, SSNN is able to achieve an accuracy of 73.63% on CIFAR10-DVS.

{"title": "Multichannel blind speech source separation with a disjoint constraint source model", "abstract": "Multichannel convolutive blind speech source separation refers to the problem of separating different speech sources from the observed multichannel mixtures without much a priori information about the mixing system. Multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF) has been proven to be one of the most powerful separation frameworks and the representative algorithms such as MNMF and the independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) have demonstrated great performance. However, the sparseness properties of speech source signals are not fully taken into account in such a framework. It is well known that speech signals are sparse in nature, which is considered in this work to improve the separation performance. Specifically, we utilize the Bingham and Laplace distributions to formulate a disjoint constraint regularizer, which is subsequently incorporated into both MNMF and ILRMA. We then derive majorization-minimization rules for updating parameters related to the source model, resulting in the development of two enhanced algorithms: s-MNMF and s-ILRMA.

However, a large number of antennas deployed in massive MIMO-ISAC raises critical challenges in acquiring both accurate channel state information and target parameter information. To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we first analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel tensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target sensing problems. Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional communication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we associate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets in terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions. Then, we propose a shared training pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the channel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a canonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical expression. On this basis, we first investigate the uniqueness condition of the tensor factorization and the maximum number of resolvable targets by utilizing the specific Vandermonde", "authors": "Ruoyu Zhang, Lei Cheng, Shuai Wang, Yi Lou, Yulong Gao, Wen Wu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Independent low-rank matrix analysis based on the Sinkhorn divergence source model for blind source separation", "abstract": "The so-called independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) has demonstrated a great potential for dealing with the problem of determined blind source separation (BSS) for audio and speech signals. This method assumes that the spectra from different frequency bands are independent and the spectral coefficients in any frequency band are Gaussian distributed. The Itakura-Saito divergence is then employed to estimate the source model related parameters. In reality, however, the spectral coefficients from different frequency bands may be dependent, which is not considered in the existing ILRMA algorithm. This paper presents an improved version of ILRMA, which considers the dependency between the spectral coefficients from different frequency bands. The Sinkhorn divergence is then exploited to optimize the source model parameters. As a result of using the cross-band information, the BSS performance is improved. But the number of parameters to be estimated also increases significantly, and so is the computational complexity. To reduce the algorithm complexity, we apply the Kronecker product to decompose the modeling matrix into the product of a number of matrices of much smaller dimensionality. An efficient algorithm is then developed to implement the Sinkhorn divergence based BSS algorithm and the complexity is reduced by an order of magnitude.", "authors": "Jianyu Wang, Shanzheng Guan, Jingdong Chen, Jacob Benesty", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

In recent years, data-aided solutions have been shown to achieve higher performance, enabled by the adaptivity of the feedback scheme to the propagation environment of the base station (BS) cell. In particular, a versatile limited feedback scheme utilizing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) was recently introduced. The scheme supports multi-user communications, exhibits low complexity, supports parallelization, and offers significant flexibility concerning various system parameters. Conceptually, a GMM captures environment knowledge and is subsequently transferred to the mobile terminals (MTs) for online inference of feedback information. Afterward, the BS designs precoders using either directional information or a generative modeling-based approach. A major shortcoming of recent works is that the assessed system performance is only evaluated through synthetic simulation data that is generally unable to fully characterize the features of real-world environments. It raises the question of how the GMM-based feedback scheme performs on real-world measurement data, especially compared to the well-established DFT-based solution.

A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or man-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas. In such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save the national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the PSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services in the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible, mobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted PSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area's ground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV. The objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the video streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by optimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the distribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power, while satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate, rate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To this end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is mathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge for a solution.

Then, we propose a greedy scheme to iteratively and alternately solve this problem, where a transformer-based beam predictor is trained to estimate the conditional power distribution based on the probing beams and user location within each iteration, and the trained predictor selects an unmeasured beam that minimizes the entropy of remaining beams. To further reduce the number of interactions and the computational complexity of the iterative scheme, we propose a two-stage probing beam selection scheme. Firstly, probing beams are selected from a location-specific codebook designed by an entropy-based criterion, and predictions are made with corresponding feedback. Secondly, the optimal beam is identified using additional probing beams with the highest predicted power values.

{"title": "A proposal for a minimal model of free reed", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a minimal model for free reeds  taking into account the significant phenomena. This free reed model may be used to build models of free reed instruments which permit numerical simulations. Several definitions for the section by which the airflow passes through the reed are reviewed and a new one is proposed which takes into account the entire escape area under the reed and the reed thickness. To derive this section, it is necessary to distinguish the neutral section (the only section of the reed which always keeps its length constant while moving) from the upstream or downstream sections. A minimal configuration is chosen to permit the instabilities of both (-,+) and (+,-) reeds on the basis of a linear analysis of instabilities conditions. This configuration is used to illustrate,  with temporal simulations, the minimal model for both kinds of reeds and to discuss the model assumptions. Some clues are given about the influence, on the playing frequency and on the dynamic of the sound, of two main parameters of the geometrical model: the size of the volume and the level of the excitation. It is shown that the playing frequency of a (+,-) reed can vary in a large range according to the  size of the volume upstream of the reed; that the playing frequency is nearly independent of the excitation but that the dynamic of the sound increases with the excitation level. Some clues are also proposed to determine the nature of the bifurcation for free reeds: it seems that free reeds may present inverse bifurcations. The influence of the reed thickness is also studied for configurations where the reed length or the reed width vary to keep the mass constant. This study shows that the reed thickness can have a great influence on the sound magnitude, the playing frequency and the magnitude of the reed displacement which justifies its introduction in the reed model.This article has been published in Acta Acustica united with Acustica, Vol. 93 (2007), p. 122-144.", "authors": "Laurent Millot", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Hallucinations in Neural Automatic Speech Recognition: Identifying Errors and Hallucinatory Models", "abstract": "Hallucinations are a type of output error produced by deep neural networks. While this has been studied in natural language processing, they have not been researched previously in automatic speech recognition. Here, we define hallucinations in ASR as transcriptions generated by a model that are semantically unrelated to the source utterance, yet still fluent and coherent. The similarity of hallucinations to probable natural language outputs of the model creates a danger of deception and impacts the credibility of the system. We show that commonly used metrics, such as word error rates, cannot differentiate between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models. To address this, we propose a perturbation-based method for assessing the susceptibility of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to hallucination at test time, which does not require access to the training dataset. We demonstrate that this method helps to distinguish between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models that have similar baseline word error rates. We further explore the relationship between the types of ASR errors and the types of dataset noise to determine what types of noise are most likely to create hallucinatory outputs. We devise a framework for identifying hallucinations by analysing their semantic connection with the ground truth and their fluency. Finally, we discover how to induce hallucinations with a random noise injection to the utterance.", "authors": "Rita Frieske, Bertram E. Shi", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

While most existing works consider that each receiver requires either the same or independent semantic information, this paper explores the scenario where the semantic information desired by different receivers is different but correlated. In particular, we investigate semantic communications over Gaussian broadcast channels where the transmitter has a common observable source but the receivers wish to recover hierarchical semantic information in adaptation to their channel conditions. Inspired by the capacity achieving property of superposition codes, we propose a deep learning based superposition coded modulation (DeepSCM) scheme. Specifically, the hierarchical semantic information is first extracted and encoded into basic and enhanced feature vectors. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then developed to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is uncorrelated with the basic features. Finally, the basic features and their refinement are superposed for broadcasting after probabilistic modulation. Experiments are conducted for two-receiver image semantic broadcasting with coarse and fine classification as hierarchical semantic tasks. DeepSCM outperforms the benchmarking coded-modulation scheme without a superposition structure, especially with large channel disparity and high order modulation.

This approach employs deep neural networks representing a dedicated encoder at the transmitter and multiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle diverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input reconstruction, and integrated sensing and communications. To extend the applicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision the deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning addresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging federated learning techniques that distribute model updates across decentralized nodes. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent on the robustness of the employed deep learning models. We scrutinize potential vulnerabilities stemming from adversarial attacks during both training and testing phases. These attacks aim to manipulate both the inputs at the encoder at the transmitter and the signals received over the air on the receiver side, highlighting the importance of fortifying semantic communications against potential multi-domain exploits.

This work proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-aware threshold-based dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (T-DFSA) for contention resolution in random access machine-type communication networks. Unlike conventional DFSA that maximizes the throughput in each frame, the frame length and age-gain threshold in T-DFSA are determined to minimize the normalized average AoI reduction of the network in each frame. At the start of each frame in the proposed protocol, the common Access Point (AP) stores an estimate of the age-gain distribution of a typical node. Depending on the observed status of the slots, age-gains of successful nodes, and maximum available AoI, the AP adjusts its estimation in each frame. The maximum available AoI is exploited to derive the maximum possible age-gain at each frame and thus, to avoid overestimating the age-gain threshold, which may render T-DFSA unstable.

For the case with unknown semantic source distribution, while only a set of the source samples is available, we propose a neural-network-based method by leveraging the generative networks to learn the semantic source distribution. Furthermore, for a special case where the semantic state is a deterministic function of the observation, we design a cascade neural network to estimate the SRDF. For the case with perfectly known semantic source distribution, we propose a general Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to effectively compute the SRDF. Finally, experimental results validate our proposed algorithms for the scenarios with ideal Gaussian semantic source and some practical datasets.", "authors": "Dongxu Li, Jianhao Huang, Chuan Huang, Xiaoqi Qin, Han Zhang, Ping Zhang", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Quadratic Time-Frequency Analysis of Vibration Signals for Diagnosing Bearing Faults", "abstract": "Diagnosis of bearing faults is paramount to reducing maintenance costs and operational breakdowns. Bearing faults are primary contributors to machine vibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into their health status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlled environments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotational speeds and the vibration's non-stationary nature. This paper presents a fusion of time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearing faults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels. First, we formulate the bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between their non-stationarity and the bearing's inherent and operational parameters. We also elucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate their effectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated with different bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequency convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults in rolling-element bearings. Our experimental findings undeniably demonstrate the superior performance of TF-CNN in comparison to recently developed techniques. They also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationary features that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience to noise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noise ratios and performance metrics. Altogether, the TF-CNN achieves substantial accuracy improvements up to 15%, in severe noise conditions.", "authors": "Mohammad Al-Sa'd, Tuomas Jalonen, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Reinforcement Learning for SAR View Angle Inversion with Differentiable SAR Renderer", "abstract": "The electromagnetic inverse problem has long been a research hotspot. This study aims to reverse radar view angles in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images given a target model. Nonetheless, the scarcity of SAR data, combined with the intricate background interference and imaging mechanisms, limit the applications of existing learning-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an interactive deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, where an electromagnetic simulator named differentiable SAR render (DSR) is embedded to facilitate the interaction between the agent and the environment, simulating a human-like process of angle prediction. Specifically, DSR generates SAR images at arbitrary view angles in real-time. And the differences in sequential and semantic aspects between the view angle-corresponding images are leveraged to construct the state space in DRL, which effectively suppress the complex background interference, enhance the sensitivity to temporal variations, and improve the capability to capture fine-grained information. Additionally, in order to maintain the stability and convergence of our method, a series of reward mechanisms, such as memory difference, smoothing and boundary penalty, are utilized to form the final reward function. Extensive experiments performed on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. When utilized in the cross-domain area, the proposed method greatly mitigates inconsistency between simulated and real domains, outperforming reference methods significantly.", "authors": "Yanni Wang, Hecheng Jia, Shilei Fu, Huiping Lin, Feng Xu", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing the allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and meanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission schemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For the resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework capable of addressing all of them. Numerical results show that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their counterparts without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission energy consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme consistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is more appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and limited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low cross-link interference scenarios.", "authors": "Ying Gao, Qingqing WU, Wen Chen", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

To mitigate the coverage limitations, high-gain beamforming is essential. Implementation of beamforming involves a large number of antennas, which introduces analog beam constraint, i.e., only one frequency-flat beam is generated per transceiver chain (TRx). Recently introduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true time delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam constraint by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams per TRx, for scheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division manner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with \"rainbow\" beams, which tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class focused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose frequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth or elevation direction. In this paper, we present a novel 3D beamforming codebook design aimed at maximizing beamforming gain to steer radiation toward desired azimuth and elevation directions, as well as across sub-bands partitioned according to scheduled users' bandwidth requirements.

Our experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly enhances the Transformer model's ability to learn representations, improving its robustness in artifact classification tasks. Among various SSL techniques, including masking, contrastive learning, and DINO (self-distillation with no labels)-contrastive learning exhibited the most stable and superior performance in small PPG datasets.

However, NeRF suffers from severe visual quality degradation when the input images have been captured under imperfect conditions, such as poor illumination, defocus blurring, and lens aberrations. Especially, defocus blur is quite common in the images when they are normally captured using cameras. Although few recent studies have proposed to render sharp images of considerably high-quality, yet they still face many key challenges. In particular, those methods have employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based NeRF, which requires tremendous computational time. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel technique Sharp-NeRF -- a grid-based NeRF that renders clean and sharp images from the input blurry images within half an hour of training. To do so, we used several grid-based kernels to accurately model the sharpness/blurriness of the scene. The sharpness level of the pixels is computed to learn the spatially varying blur kernels. We have conducted experiments on the benchmarks consisting of blurry images and have evaluated full-reference and non-reference metrics.

{"title": "GLIMPSE: Generalized Local Imaging with MLPs", "abstract": "Deep learning is the current de facto state of the art in tomographic imaging. A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for example the backprojection, to a convolutional neural network (CNN) which then computes the reconstruction. Despite strong results on 'in-distribution' test data similar to the training data, backprojection from sparse-view data delocalizes singularities, so these approaches require a large receptive field to perform well. As a consequence, they overfit to certain global structures which leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Moreover, their memory complexity and training time scale unfavorably with image resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical resolutions, especially in 3D: a standard U-Net requires a substantial 140GB of memory and 2600 seconds per epoch on a research-grade GPU when training on 1024x1024 images. In this paper, we introduce GLIMPSE, a local processing neural network for computed tomography which reconstructs a pixel value by feeding only the measurements associated with the neighborhood of the pixel to a simple MLP. While achieving comparable or better performance with successful CNNs like the U-Net on in-distribution test data, GLIMPSE significantly outperforms them on OOD samples while maintaining a memory footprint almost independent of image resolution; 5GB memory suffices to train on 1024x1024 images.

Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement tasks in this work.

However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for meshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging off-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit the NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel Continuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two innovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based on the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of self-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally suitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more compactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function factorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group and across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the similarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows our method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data processing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising) and off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery) validate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "authors": "Yisi Luo, Xile Zhao, Deyu Meng", "date": " 1 Jan 2024"},

The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding. For linear coding, we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability. We then propose an efficient algorithm for joint encoder/decoder design. For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding. Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance. We also demonstrate that our linear coding excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs. We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.", "authors": "Junghoon Kim, Taejoon Kim, Anindya Bijoy Das, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, David J.

{"title": "Sounding Out Reconstruction Error-Based Evaluation of Generative Models of Expressive Performance", "abstract": "Generative models of expressive piano performance are usually assessed by comparing their predictions to a reference human performance. A generative algorithm is taken to be better than competing ones if it produces performances that are closer to a human reference performance. However, expert human performers can (and do) interpret music in different ways, making for different possible references, and quantitative closeness is not necessarily aligned with perceptual similarity, raising concerns about the validity of this evaluation approach. In this work, we present a number of experiments that shed light on this problem. Using precisely measured high-quality performances of classical piano music, we carry out a listening test indicating that listeners can sometimes perceive subtle performance difference that go unnoticed under quantitative evaluation. We further present tests that indicate that such evaluation frameworks show a lot of variability in reliability and validity across different reference performances and pieces. We discuss these results and their implications for quantitative evaluation, and hope to foster a critical appreciation of the uncertainties involved in quantitative assessments of such performances within the wider music information retrieval (MIR) community.", "authors": "Silvan David Peter, Carlos Eduardo Cancino-Chacón, Emmanouil Karystinaios, Gerhard Widmer", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},

Fortunately, up to 70 percent of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free if properly diagnosed and treated, and a reliable technique to monitor the onset of seizures could improve the quality of life of patients who are constantly facing the fear of random seizure attacks. The scalp-based EEG test, despite being the gold standard for diagnosing epilepsy, is costly, necessitates hospitalization, demands skilled professionals for operation, and is discomforting for users. In this paper, we propose EarSD, a novel lightweight, unobtrusive, and socially acceptable ear-worn system to detect epileptic seizure onsets by measuring the physiological signals from behind the user's ears. EarSD includes an integrated custom-built sensing, computing, and communication PCB to collect and amplify the signals of interest, remove the noises caused by motion artifacts and environmental impacts, and stream the data wirelessly to the computer or mobile phone nearby, where data are uploaded to the host computer for further processing. We conducted both in-lab and in-hospital experiments with epileptic seizure patients who were hospitalized for seizure studies.

The complexity arises as a single optical data can have multiple SAR representations based on the SAR viewing geometry. We propose a novel approach, termed SAR Temporal Shifting, which inputs an optical data from the desired timestamp along with a SAR data from a different temporal point but with a consistent viewing geometry as the expected SAR data, both complemented with a change map of optical data during the intervening period. This model modifies the SAR data based on the changes observed in optical data to generate the SAR data for the desired timestamp. Our model, a dual conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named Temporal Shifting GAN (TSGAN), incorporates a siamese encoder in both the Generator and the Discriminator. To prevent the model from overfitting on the input SAR data, we employed a change weighted loss function. Our approach surpasses traditional translation methods by eliminating the GAN's fiction phenomenon, particularly in unchanged regions, resulting in higher SSIM and PSNR in these areas. Additionally, modifications to the Pix2Pix architecture and the inclusion of attention mechanisms have enhanced the model's performance on all regions of the data. This research paves the way for leveraging legacy optical datasets, the most abundant and longstanding source of Earth imagery data, extending their use to SAR domains and temporal analyses.

However, to achieve desired channel gains through beamforming in HMT, phase-shifts of a large number of elements need to be appropriately set, which is challenging. Also, these optimal phase-shifts depend on the location of the receivers, which could be unknown. In this work, we develop a learning algorithm using a {\\it fixed-budget multi-armed bandit framework} to beamform and maximize received signal strength at the receiver for far-field regions. Our algorithm, named \\Algo exploits the parametric form of channel gains of the beams, which can be expressed in terms of two {\\it phase-shifting parameters}. Even after parameterization, the problem is still challenging as phase-shifting parameters take continuous values. To overcome this, {\\it\\HB} works with the discrete values of phase-shifting parameters and exploits their unimodal relations with channel gains to learn the optimal values faster. We upper bound the probability of {\\it\\HB} incorrectly identifying the (discrete) optimal phase-shift parameters in terms of the number of pilots used in learning. We show that this probability decays exponentially with the number of pilot signals.

While employing numerous sensors with high-frequency sampling rates usually improves the results, it often leads to data inefficiency and unnecessary expansion of the ANN, posing a challenge for their practical deployment on edge devices. Addressing these issues, our work introduces a pragmatic framework for data-efficient utilization in HAR tasks, considering the optimization of both sensor modalities and sampling rate simultaneously. Central to our approach are the designed trainable parameters, termed 'Weight Scores,' which assess the significance of each sensor modality and sampling rate during the training phase. These scores guide the sensor modalities and sampling rate selection. The pruning method allows users to make a trade-off between computational budgets and performance by selecting the sensor modalities and sampling rates according to the weight score ranking. We tested our framework's effectiveness in optimizing sensor modality and sampling rate selection using three public HAR benchmark datasets. The results show that the sensor and sampling rate combination selected via CoSS achieves similar classification performance to configurations using the highest sampling rate with all sensors but at a reduced hardware cost.", "authors": "Mengxi Liu, Zimin Zhao, Daniel Geißler, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Wavelet Dynamic Selection Network for Inertial Sensor Signal Enhancement", "abstract": "As attitude and motion sensing components, inertial sensors are widely used in various portable devices. But the severe errors of inertial sensors restrain their function, especially the trajectory recovery and semantic recognition. As a mainstream signal processing method, wavelet is hailed as the mathematical microscope of signal due to the plentiful and diverse wavelet basis functions. However, complicated noise types and application scenarios of inertial sensors make selecting wavelet basis perplexing. To this end, we propose a wavelet dynamic selection network (WDSNet), which intelligently selects the appropriate wavelet basis for variable inertial signals. In addition, existing deep learning architectures excel at extracting features from input data but neglect to learn the characteristics of target categories, which is essential to enhance the category awareness capability, thereby improving the selection of wavelet basis. Therefore, we propose a category representation mechanism (CRM), which enables the network to extract and represent category features without increasing trainable parameters. Furthermore, CRM transforms the common fully connected network into category representations, which provide closer supervision to the feature extractor than the far and trivial one-hot classification labels. We call this process of imposing interpretability on a network and using it to supervise the feature extractor the feature supervision mechanism, and its effectiveness is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically in this paper. The enhanced inertial signal can perform impracticable tasks with regard to the original signal, such as trajectory reconstruction. Both quantitative and visual results show that WDSNet outperforms the existing methods.

Case studies on both energy demand and supply data show that the forecasts from our proposed method can provide accurate information in both time and frequency domains. Across the resolutions, the forecasts also demonstrate high consistency. More importantly, we explore the operational effects of our produced forecasts in the day-ahead and intra-day energy scheduling.

In our approach, first, we pre-process the CIR data which involves meticulous aggregation of measurements and extraction of key statistics. Afterwards, we leverage a convolutional deep neural network to map the CIRs into precise location estimates with sub-30 cm accuracy. Similarly, we achieve accurate human activity recognition and occupancy counting results.

Due to the NP-hard nature of sparse recovery, existing methods are known to suffer either from restrictive (or even unknown) applicability conditions, or high computational cost. Recently, iterative regularization methods have emerged as a promising fast approach because they can achieve sparse recovery in one pass through early stopping, rather than the tedious grid-search used in the traditional methods. However, most of those iterative methods are based on the $\\ell_1$ norm which requires restrictive applicability conditions and could fail in many cases. Therefore, achieving sparse recovery with iterative regularization methods under a wider range of conditions has yet to be further explored. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative regularization algorithm, IRKSN, based on the $k$-support norm regularizer rather than the $\\ell_1$ norm. We provide conditions for sparse recovery with IRKSN, and compare them with traditional conditions for recovery with $\\ell_1$ norm regularizers. Additionally, we give an early stopping bound on the model error of IRKSN with explicit constants, achieving the standard linear rate for sparse recovery.

{"title": "Eating Speed Measurement Using Wrist-Worn IMU Sensors in Free-Living Environments", "abstract": "Eating speed is an important indicator that has been widely scrutinized in nutritional studies. The relationship between eating speed and several intake-related problems such as obesity, diabetes, and oral health has received increased attention from researchers. However, existing studies mainly use self-reported questionnaires to obtain participants' eating speed, where they choose options from slow, medium, and fast. Such a non-quantitative method is highly subjective and coarse in individual level. In this study, we propose a novel approach to measure eating speed in free-living environments automatically and objectively using wrist-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. Specifically, a temporal convolutional network combined with a multi-head attention module (TCN-MHA) is developed to detect bites (including eating and drinking gestures) from free-living IMU data. The predicted bite sequences are then clustered to eating episodes. Eating speed is calculated by using the time taken to finish the eating episode to divide the number of bites. To validate the proposed approach on eating speed measurement, a 7-fold cross validation is applied to the self-collected fine-annotated full-day-I (FD-I) dataset, and a hold-out experiment is conducted on the full-day-II (FD-II) dataset. The two datasets are collected from 61 participants in free-living environments with a total duration of 513 h, which are publicly available. Experimental results shows that the proposed approach achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.110 and 0.146 in the FD-I and FD-II datasets, respectively, showcasing the feasibility of automated eating speed measurement.

Due to the absence of high-resolution MS images, available deep-learning-based methods usually follow the paradigm of training at reduced resolution and testing at both reduced and full resolution. When taking original MS and PAN images as inputs, they always obtain sub-optimal results due to the scale variation. In this paper, we propose to explore the self-supervised representation of pansharpening by designing a cross-predictive diffusion model, named CrossDiff. It has two-stage training. In the first stage, we introduce a cross-predictive pretext task to pre-train the UNet structure based on conditional DDPM, while in the second stage, the encoders of the UNets are frozen to directly extract spatial and spectral features from PAN and MS, and only the fusion head is trained to adapt for pansharpening task.

{"title": "Detecting QT prolongation From a Single-lead ECG With Deep Learning", "abstract": "For a number of antiarrhythmics, drug loading requires a 3 day hospitalization with monitoring for QT prolongation. Automated QT monitoring with wearable ECG monitors would facilitate out-of-hospital care. We develop a deep learning model that infers QT intervals from ECG lead-I - the lead most often acquired from ambulatory ECG monitors - and to use this model to detect clinically meaningful QT-prolongation episodes during Dofetilide drug loading. Using 4.22 million 12-lead ECG recordings from 903.6 thousand patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital, we develop a deep learning model, QTNet, that infers QT intervals from lead-I. Over 3 million ECGs from 653 thousand patients are used to train the model and an internal-test set containing 633 thousand ECGs from 135 thousand patients was used for testing. QTNet is further evaluated on an external-validation set containing 3.1 million ECGs from 667 thousand patients at another institution. QTNet was used to detect Dofetilide-induced QT prolongation in a publicly available database (ECGRDVQ-dataset) containing ECGs from subjects enrolled in a clinical trial evaluating the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. QTNet achieves mean absolute errors of 12.63ms (internal-test) and 12.30ms (external-validation) for estimating absolute QT intervals. The associated Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.91 (internal-test) and 0.92 (external-validation). For the ECGRDVQ-dataset, QTNet detects Dofetilide-induced QTc prolongation with 87% sensitivity and 77% specificity. The negative predictive value of the model is greater than 95% when the pre-test probability of drug-induced QTc prolongation is below 25%.

In this paper, we introduce domain generalization into automatic sleep staging and propose the task of generalizable sleep staging which aims to improve the model generalization ability to unseen datasets. Inspired by existing domain generalization methods, we adopt the feature alignment idea and propose a framework called SleepDG to solve it. Considering both of local salient features and sequential features are important for sleep staging, we propose a Multi-level Feature Alignment combining epoch-level and sequence-level feature alignment to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Specifically, we design an Epoch-level Feature Alignment to align the feature distribution of each single sleep epoch among different domains, and a Sequence-level Feature Alignment to minimize the discrepancy of sequential features among different domains.

This has limited their applications in many scenarios (e.g., autonomous systems, supersonic flows) that have a limited energy budget and require near real-time response. Leveraging optical computing, this paper develops an on-chip training framework for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), aiming to solve high-dimensional PDEs with fJ/MAC photonic power consumption and ultra-low latency. Despite the ultra-high speed of optical neural networks, training a PINN on an optical chip is hard due to (1) the large size of photonic devices, and (2) the lack of scalable optical memory devices to store the intermediate results of back-propagation (BP). To enable realistic optical PINN training, this paper presents a scalable method to avoid the BP process. We also employ a tensor-compressed approach to improve the convergence and scalability of our optical PINN training. This training framework is designed with tensorized optical neural networks (TONN) for scalable inference acceleration and MZI phase-domain tuning for \\textit{in-situ} optimization. Our simulation results of a 20-dim HJB PDE show that our photonic accelerator can reduce the number of MZIs by a factor of $1.17\\times 10^3$, with only $1.36$ J and $1.15$ s to solve this equation.

The clinical technique radiologists adopt for distinguishing between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using Machine Resonance Imaging (MRI) encounter hurdles because they are not consistent and reliable. Machine learning has been shown to offer promise for early AD diagnosis. However, existing models focused on focal fine-grain features without considerations to focal structural features that give off information on neurodegeneration of the brain cerebral cortex. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML) framework that integrates Gamma correction, an image enhancement technique, and includes a structure-focused neurodegeneration convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called SNeurodCNN for discriminating between AD and MCI. The ML framework leverages the mid-sagittal and para-sagittal brain image viewpoints of the structure-focused Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Through experiments, our proposed machine learning framework shows exceptional performance. The parasagittal viewpoint set achieves 97.8% accuracy, with 97.0% specificity and 98.5% sensitivity. The midsagittal viewpoint is shown to present deeper insights into the structural brain changes given the increase in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, which are 98.1% 97.2%, and 99.0%, respectively.

Features of the attended and ignored speech stream can also be reconstructed from the EEG recordings, with the reconstruction quality serving as a marker of selective auditory attention. Using the stimulus-reconstruction method, we show that with this device auditory attention can be decoded from short segments of EEG recordings which are of just a few seconds in duration.

This is particularly beneficial in the context of rail defect detection, where the ICS would emulate human-like analysis of image data for defect patterns. Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in visual defect classification, the scarcity of large datasets for rail defect detection remains a challenge due to infrequent accident events that would result in defective parts and images. Contemporary researchers have addressed this data scarcity challenge by exploring rule-based and generative data augmentation models.

Traditionally, DR is monitored using Color Fundus Photography (CFP), a widespread 2-D imaging modality. However, DR classifications based on CFP have poor predictive power, resulting in suboptimal DR management. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a recent 3-D imaging modality offering enhanced structural and functional information (blood flow) with a wider field of view. This paper investigates automatic DR severity assessment using 3-D OCTA. A straightforward solution to this task is a 3-D neural network classifier. However, 3-D architectures have numerous parameters and typically require many training samples. A lighter solution consists in using 2-D neural network classifiers processing 2-D en-face (or frontal) projections and/or 2-D cross-sectional slices. Such an approach mimics the way ophthalmologists analyze OCTA acquisitions: 1) en-face flow maps are often used to detect avascular zones and neovascularization, and 2) cross-sectional slices are commonly analyzed to detect macular edemas, for instance. However, arbitrary data reduction or selection might result in information loss. Two complementary strategies are thus proposed to optimally summarize OCTA volumes with 2-D images: 1) a parametric en-face projection optimized through deep learning and 2) a cross-sectional slice selection process controlled through gradient-based attribution. The full summarization and DR classification pipeline is trained from end to end. The automatic 2-D summary can be displayed in a viewer or printed in a report to support the decision.

{"title": "UGPNet: Universal Generative Prior for Image Restoration", "abstract": "Recent image restoration methods can be broadly categorized into two classes: (1) regression methods that recover the rough structure of the original image without synthesizing high-frequency details and (2) generative methods that synthesize perceptually-realistic high-frequency details even though the resulting image deviates from the original structure of the input. While both directions have been extensively studied in isolation, merging their benefits with a single framework has been rarely studied. In this paper, we propose UGPNet, a universal image restoration framework that can effectively achieve the benefits of both approaches by simply adopting a pair of an existing regression model and a generative model. UGPNet first restores the image structure of a degraded input using a regression model and synthesizes a perceptually-realistic image with a generative model on top of the regressed output. UGPNet then combines the regressed output and the synthesized output, resulting in a final result that faithfully reconstructs the structure of the original image in addition to perceptually-realistic textures. Our extensive experiments on deblurring, denoising, and super-resolution demonstrate that UGPNet can successfully exploit both regression and generative methods for high-fidelity image restoration.", "authors": "Hwayoon Lee, Kyoungkook Kang, Hyeongmin Lee, Seung-Hwan Baek, Sunghyun Cho", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},

Existing methods tend to independently utilize each of these knowledge components with multiple blocks, overlooking the inherent 3D nature of HSIs where domain knowledge is strongly interlinked, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a spatial-spectral recurrent transformer U-Net (SSRT-UNet) for HSI denoising. The proposed SSRT-UNet integrates NSS and GSC properties within a single SSRT block. This block consists of a spatial branch and a spectral branch. The spectral branch employs a combination of transformer and recurrent neural network to perform recurrent computations across bands, allowing for GSC exploitation beyond a fixed number of bands. Concurrently, the spatial branch encodes NSS for each band by sharing keys and values with the spectral branch under the guidance of GSC. This interaction between the two branches enables the joint utilization of NSS and GSC, avoiding their independent treatment.

{"title": "Pseudorange Rigidity and Solvability of Cooperative GNSS Positioning", "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are a widely used technology for positioning and navigation. GNSS positioning relies on pseudorange measurements from satellites to receivers. A pseudorange is the apparent distance between two agents deduced from the time-of-flight of a signal sent from one agent to the other. Because of the lack of synchronization between the agents' clocks, it is a biased version of their distance. This paper introduces a new rigidity theory adapted to pseudorange measurements. The peculiarity of pseudoranges is that they are asymmetrical measurements. Therefore, unlike other usual rigidities, the graphs of pseudorange frameworks are directed. In this paper, pseudorange rigidity is proved to be a generic property of the underlying undirected graph of constraints. The main result is a characterization of rigid pseudorange graphs as combinations of rigid distance graphs and connected graphs. This new theory is adapted for GNSS.

{"title": "Inverse Nonlinearity Compensation of Hyperelastic Deformation in Dielectric Elastomer for Acoustic Actuation", "abstract": "This paper delves into the analysis of nonlinear deformation induced by dielectric actuation in pre-stressed ideal dielectric elastomers. It formulates a nonlinear ordinary differential equation governing this deformation based on the hyperelastic model under dielectric stress. Through numerical integration and neural network approximations, the relationship between voltage and stretch is established. Neural networks are employed to approximate solutions for voltage-to-stretch and stretch-to-voltage transformations obtained via an explicit Runge-Kutta method. The effectiveness of these approximations is demonstrated by leveraging them for compensating nonlinearity through the waveshaping of the input signal. The comparative analysis highlights the superior accuracy of the approximated solutions over baseline methods, resulting in minimized harmonic distortions when utilizing dielectric elastomers as acoustic actuators. This study underscores the efficacy of the proposed approach in mitigating nonlinearities and enhancing the performance of dielectric elastomers in acoustic actuation applications.", "authors": "Jin Woo Lee, Gwang Seok An, Jeong-Yun Sun, Kyogu Lee", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "An event-based implementation of saliency-based visual attention for rapid scene analysis", "abstract": "Selective attention is an essential mechanism to filter sensory input and to select only its most important components, allowing the capacity-limited cognitive structures of the brain to process them in detail. The saliency map model, originally developed to understand the process of selective attention in the primate visual system, has also been extensively used in computer vision. Due to the wide-spread use of frame-based video, this is how dynamic input from non-stationary scenes is commonly implemented in saliency maps. However, the temporal structure of this input modality is very different from that of the primate visual system. Retinal input to the brain is massively parallel, local rather than frame-based, asynchronous rather than synchronous, and transmitted in the form of discrete events, neuronal action potentials (spikes). These features are captured by event-based cameras. We show that a computational saliency model can be obtained organically from such vision sensors, at minimal computational cost. We assess the performance of the model by comparing its predictions with the distribution of overt attention (fixations) of human observers, and we make available an event-based dataset that can be used as ground truth for future studies.", "authors": "Camille Simon Chane, Ernst Niebur, Ryad Benosman, Sio-Hoi Ieng", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Probing the Limits and Capabilities of Diffusion Models for the Anatomic Editing of Digital Twins", "abstract": "Numerical simulations can model the physical processes that govern cardiovascular device deployment. When such simulations incorporate digital twins; computational models of patient-specific anatomy, they can expedite and de-risk the device design process. Nonetheless, the exclusive use of patient-specific data constrains the anatomic variability which can be precisely or fully explored. In this study, we investigate the capacity of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to edit digital twins to create anatomic variants, which we term digital siblings. Digital twins and their corresponding siblings can serve as the basis for comparative simulations, enabling the study of how subtle anatomic variations impact the simulated deployment of cardiovascular devices, as well as the augmentation of virtual cohorts for device assessment. However, while diffusion models have been characterized in their ability to edit natural images, their capacity to anatomically edit digital twins has yet to be studied. Using a case example centered on 3D digital twins of cardiac anatomy, we implement various methods for generating digital siblings and characterize them through morphological and topological analyses. We specifically edit digital twins to introduce anatomic variation at different spatial scales and within localized regions, demonstrating the existence of bias towards common anatomic features. We further show that such anatomic bias can be leveraged for virtual cohort augmentation through selective editing, partially alleviating issues related to dataset imbalance and lack of diversity. Our experimental framework thus delineates the limits and capabilities of using latent diffusion models in synthesizing anatomic variation for in silico trials.", "authors": "Karim Kadry, Shreya Gupta, Farhad R.

{"title": "Creating Personalized Synthetic Voices from Articulation Impaired Speech Using Augmented Reconstruction Loss", "abstract": "This research is about the creation of personalized synthetic voices for head and neck cancer survivors. It is focused particularly on tongue cancer patients whose speech might exhibit severe articulation impairment. Our goal is to restore normal articulation in the synthesized speech, while maximally preserving the target speaker's individuality in terms of both the voice timbre and speaking style. This is formulated as a task of learning from noisy labels. We propose to augment the commonly used speech reconstruction loss with two additional terms. The first term constitutes a regularization loss that mitigates the impact of distorted articulation in the training speech. The second term is a consistency loss that encourages correct articulation in the generated speech. These additional loss terms are obtained from frame-level articulation scores of original and generated speech, which are derived using a separately trained phone classifier. Experimental results on a real case of tongue cancer patient confirm that the synthetic voice achieves comparable articulation quality to unimpaired natural speech, while effectively maintaining the target speaker's individuality.

{"title": "Mapping Information in Feature Extraction Transformation for Chirp Signal", "abstract": "Chirp signals have established diverse applications caused by the capable of producing time-dependent linear frequencies. Most feature extraction transformation methods for chirp signals focus on enhancing the performance of transform methods but neglecting the information derived from the transformation process. Consequently, they may fail to fully exploit the information from observations, resulting in decreased performance under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio and limited observations. In this work, we develop a novel post-processing method called mapping information model to addressing this challenge. The model establishes a link between the observation space and feature space in feature extraction transform, enabling interference suppression and obtain more accurate information by iteratively resampling and assigning weights in both spaces. Analysis of the iteration process reveals a continual increase in weight of signal samples and a gradual stability in weight of noise samples. The demonstration of the noise suppression in the iteration process and feature enhancement supports the effectiveness of the mapping information model. Furthermore, numerical simulations also affirm the high efficiency of the proposed model by showcasing enhanced signal detection and estimation performances without requiring additional observations. This superior model allows amplifying performance within feature extraction transformation for chirp signal processing under low SNR and limited observation conditions, opens up new opportunities for areas such as communication, biomedicine, and remote sensing.", "authors": "Shuyi Gu, Zhenghua Luo, Lin Hu, Yilin Zhang, Junxiong Guo", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration of boosting LLMs with the ability to generate speech, by combining pre-trained LLM LLaMA/OPT and text-to-speech synthesis model VALL-E. We compare three integration methods between LLMs and speech synthesis models, including directly fine-tuned LLMs, superposed layers of LLMs and VALL-E, and coupled LLMs and VALL-E using LLMs as a powerful text encoder. Experimental results show that, using LoRA method to fine-tune LLMs directly to boost the speech synthesis capability does not work well, and superposed LLMs and VALL-E can improve the quality of generated speech both in speaker similarity and word error rate (WER). Among these three methods, coupled methods leveraging LLMs as the text encoder can achieve the best performance, making it outperform original speech synthesis models with a consistently better speaker similarity and a significant (10.9%) WER reduction.", "authors": "Hongkun Hao, Long Zhou, Shujie Liu, Jinyu Li, Shujie Hu, Rui Wang, Furu Wei", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

{"title": "A Novel Approach for Defect Detection of Wind Turbine Blade Using Virtual Reality and Deep Learning", "abstract": "Wind turbines are subjected to continuous rotational stresses and unusual external forces such as storms, lightning, strikes by flying objects, etc., which may cause defects in turbine blades. Hence, it requires a periodical inspection to ensure proper functionality and avoid catastrophic failure. The task of inspection is challenging due to the remote location and inconvenient reachability by human inspection. Researchers used images with cropped defects from the wind turbine in the literature. They neglected possible background biases, which may hinder real-time and autonomous defect detection using aerial vehicles such as drones or others. To overcome such challenges, in this paper, we experiment with defect detection accuracy by having the defects with the background using a two-step deep-learning methodology. In the first step, we develop virtual models of wind turbines to synthesize the near-reality images for four types of common defects - cracks, leading edge erosion, bending, and light striking damage. The Unity perception package is used to generate wind turbine blade defects images with variations in background, randomness, camera angle, and light effects. In the second step, a customized U-Net architecture is trained to classify and segment the defect in turbine blades. The outcomes of U-Net architecture have been thoroughly tested and compared with 5-fold validation datasets.

Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time).", "authors": "Eduardo Sebastian, Thai Duong, Nikolay Atanasov, Eduardo Montijano, Carlos Sagues", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

To this end, a novel view to incorporate hierarchical information path LUPET into multilingual ASR is proposed. The LUPET is a path encoding multiple information in different granularity from shallow to deep encoder layers. Early information in this path is beneficial for deriving later occurred information. Specifically, the input goes from LID prediction to acoustic unit discovery followed by phoneme sharing, and then dynamically routed by mixture-of-expert for final token recognition. Experiments on 10 languages of Common Voice examined the superior performance of LUPET. Importantly, LUPET significantly boosts the recognition on high-resource languages, thus mitigating the compromised phenomenon towards low-resource languages in a multilingual setting.", "authors": "Wei Liu, Jingyong Hou, Dong Yang, Muyong Cao, Tan Lee", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

Traditional tempo estimation methods typically detect signal periodicities that reflect the underlying rhythmic structure of the music, often using some form of autocorrelation of the amplitude envelope (Lartillot and Toiviainen 2007).

The aim here is to provide an overview of some of the more common AI-based tempo estimation algorithms and to shine a light on notable benefits and potential drawbacks of each.

The resultant precoders only need to be updated once per block, and while not necessarily constant over all the symbol slots, we refer to the technique as block-level slot-variant IE precoding. Through a careful examination of the optimal structure and the explicit duality inherent in block-level power minimization (PM) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing (SB) problems, we discover that the joint optimization can be decomposed into subproblems with smaller variable sizes. As a step further, we propose block-level slot-invariant IE precoding by adding a structural constraint on the slot-variant IE precoding to maintain a constant precoder throughout the block. A novel linear precoder for IE is further presented, and we prove that the proposed slot-variant and slot-invariant IE precoding share an identical solution when the number of symbol slots does not exceed the number of users.

Body-area capacitive sensing, also called body-area electric field sensing, is becoming a promising alternative for wearable devices to accomplish certain tasks in human activity recognition and human-computer interaction. Over the last decade, researchers have explored plentiful novel sensing systems backed by the body-area electric field.

Although several methods to suppress the exterior radiation have been proposed, suppression in all outward directions is generally difficult, especially when the number of loudspeakers is not sufficiently large. We propose the directionally weighted exterior radiation representation to prioritize the suppression directions by incorporating it into the optimization problem of sound field synthesis.

To address this research gap, background subtraction is proposed on the monostatic sensing echoes, which effectively addresses clutter removal and facilitates detection and tracking of user equipments (UEs) in cluttered indoor environments with SAC. A realistic evaluation of the introduced SAC strategy is provided, using ray tracing (RT) data with the scenario layout following Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) indoor factory (InF) channel models.

The proposed system builds upon decomposing speech into semantic tokens, speaker representations and emotion embeddings. Using these factors, we propose a framework to reconstruct the pitch contour of the given speech signal and train a decoder that reconstructs the speech signal.

The free movement of antenna elements within a given aperture allows several users to share the same radio channel at no additional cost and without the need of precoding. However, the true potential of FAS is still unknown due to the high spatial correlation of the wireless channel between very close-by antenna positions, which yields intractable analyses for conventional correlation models such as Jake's. Therefore, there is an outstanding need for simple yet accurate correlation models that allow to unveil the multiplexing capabilities of FAS, since realistic classical models are prohibitively complex while state-of-the-art approximations may be too simplistic. Aiming to fill this gap, we here propose a general framework to approximate spatial correlation by block-diagonal matrices, motivated by the well-known block fading assumption and by statistical results on large correlation matrices. The proposed block-correlation model makes the performance analysis possible, and tightly approximates the results obtained with realistic models such as Jake's and Clarke's.

The advantage of this measure is its simplicity as the posterior probabilities of each class are available in connectionist phoneme recognition. The entropy and a number of measures based on differentiation of the entropy are used in isolation and in combination. The decision methods for predicting the boundaries range from simple thresholds to neural network based procedure.

On the one hand, the stripe noise is separately modeled by the tensor decomposition, which can effectively encode the spatial-spectral correlation of the stripe noise. On the other hand, adaptive hyper-Laplacian spatial-spectral regularization is introduced to represent the distribution structure of different HSI gradient data by adaptively estimating the optimal hyper-Laplacian parameter, which can reduce the spatial information loss and over-smoothing caused by the previous total variation regularization.

However, in high spatial resolution remote sensing image (RSI), the same category from different domains (\\emph{e.g.}, urban and rural) can appear to be totally different with extremely inconsistent distributions, which heavily limits the UDA accuracy. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Covariance Alignment (DCA) model for UDA RSI segmentation. The DCA can explicitly align category features to learn shared domain-invariant discriminative feature representations, which enhances the ability of model generalization. Specifically, a Category Feature Pooling (CFP) module is first employed to extract category features by combining the coarse outputs and the deep features. Then, we leverage a novel Covariance Regularization (CR) to enforce the intra-category features to be closer and the inter-category features to be further separate. Compared with the existing category alignment methods, our CR aims to regularize the correlation between different dimensions of the features and thus performs more robustly when dealing with the divergent category features of imbalanced and inconsistent distributions.

In contrast to finger-based PPG signals, wrist-based PPG are more susceptible to noise, particularly in their low frequency range, which includes respiratory information. Therefore, the existing methods struggle to accurately extract RR when PPG data are collected from wrist area under free-living conditions. The increasing popularity of smartwatches, equipped with various sensors including PPG, has prompted the need for a robust RR estimation method. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach to extract RR from PPG, accelerometer, and gyroscope signals captured via smartwatches.

Following prior arts in self-supervised audio-visual representation learning, HiCMAE adopts two primary forms of self-supervision for pre-training, namely masked data modeling and contrastive learning. Unlike them which focus exclusively on top-layer representations while neglecting explicit guidance of intermediate layers, HiCMAE develops a three-pronged strategy to foster hierarchical audio-visual feature learning and improve the overall quality of learned representations. To verify the effectiveness of HiCMAE, we conduct extensive experiments on 9 datasets covering both categorical and dimensional AVER tasks.

Building upon the Intrinsic Time Decomposition (ITD) and information-theoretical analysis, we introduce two alternative procedures for selecting the tendency from the ITD baselines. The first is based on the maximum extrema prominence, namely the maximum difference between extrema within each baseline. Specifically this method selects the tendency as the baseline from which an ITD step would produce the largest decline of the maximum prominence. The second method uses the rotations from the ITD and selects the tendency as the last baseline for which the associated rotation is statistically stationary.

However, this also inevitably incurs higher hardware and energy cost, which may not be affordable in future wireless systems. To address this issue, we propose in this paper to exploit two types of sparse arrays (SAs) for enabling near-field communications. Specifically, we first consider the linear sparse array (LSA) and characterize its near-field beam pattern. It is shown that despite the achieved beam-focusing gain, the LSA introduces several undesired grating-lobes, which have comparable beam power with the main-lobe and are focused on specific regions. An efficient hybrid beamforming design is then proposed for the LSA to deal with the potential strong inter-user interference (IUI). Next, we consider another form of SA, called extended coprime array (ECA), which is composed of two LSA subarrays with different (coprime) inter-antenna spacing. By characterizing the ECA near-field beam pattern, we show that compared with the LSA with the same array sparsity, the ECA can greatly suppress the beam power of near-field grating-lobes thanks to the offset effect of the two subarrays, albeit with a larger number of grating-lobes. This thus motivates us to propose a customized two-phase hybrid beamforming design for the ECA.

In this setting, it is common to assume that limited information is known about the turbulent medium, such as a space- and time-averaged statistic (e.g., root-mean-square), but without information about the state of the spatial variations. It could be helpful to gain more information if the state of the turbulent medium can be characterized with the spatial variations and evolution in time described. Here, we propose to investigate the use of data assimilation techniques for this purpose. A computational setting is used with the paraxial wave equation, and the extended Kalman filter is used to conduct data assimilation using intensity measurements. To reduce computational cost, the evolution of the turbulent medium is modeled as a stochastic process. Following some past studies, the process has only a small number of Fourier wavelengths for spatial variations. The results show that the spatial and temporal variations of the medium are recovered accurately in many cases. In some time windows in some cases, the error is larger for the recovery.

However, an automatic speaker verification system is still vulnerable to spoofing attacks such as replay or Deep-Fake audio. Deep-Fake audio means that the spoofed utterances are generated using text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) algorithms. Here, we propose a novel framework based on hybrid features with the self-attention mechanism. It is expected that hybrid features can be used to get more discrimination capacity. Firstly, instead of only one type of conventional feature, deep learning features and Mel-spectrogram features will be extracted by two parallel paths: convolution neural networks and a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) followed by Mel-frequency. Secondly, features will be concatenated by a max-pooling layer. Thirdly, there is a Self-attention mechanism for focusing on essential elements. Finally, ResNet and a linear layer are built to get the results. Experimental results reveal that the hybrid features, compared with conventional features, can cover more details of an utterance. We achieve the best Equal Error Rate (EER) of 9.67\\% in the physical access (PA) scenario and 8.94\\% in the Deep fake task on the ASVspoof 2021 dataset. Compared with the best baseline system, the proposed approach improves by 74.60\\% and 60.05\\%, respectively.", "authors": "Lian Huang, Chi-Man Pun", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

In this paper, we report extensive analysis and validation of four search methods bag of visual words (BoVW), Yottixel, SISH, RetCCL, and some of their potential variants. We analyze their algorithms and structures and assess their performance. For this evaluation, we utilized four internal datasets ($1269$ patients) and three public datasets ($1207$ patients), totaling more than $200,000$ patches from $38$ different classes/subtypes across five primary sites. Certain search engines, for example, BoVW, exhibit notable efficiency and speed but suffer from low accuracy. Conversely, search engines like Yottixel demonstrate efficiency and speed, providing moderately accurate results. Recent proposals, including SISH, display inefficiency and yield inconsistent outcomes, while alternatives like RetCCL prove inadequate in both accuracy and efficiency.

Class-probability-based confidence scores do not accurately represent the quality of overconfident ASR predictions. An ancillary Confidence Estimation Model (CEM) calibrates the predictions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions use binary target scores for CEM training. However, the binary labels do not reveal the granular information of predicted words, such as temporal alignment between reference and hypothesis and whether the predicted word is entirely incorrect or contains spelling errors. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Temporal-Lexeme Similarity (TeLeS) confidence score to train CEM. To address the data imbalance of target scores while training CEM, we use shrinkage loss to focus on hard-to-learn data points and minimise the impact of easily learned data points. We conduct experiments with ASR models trained in three languages, namely Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada, with varying training data sizes. Experiments show that TeLeS generalises well across domains. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, we formulate a TeLeS-based Acquisition (TeLeS-A) function for sampling uncertainty in active learning.

In this context, a feature that deserves further exploration is the frequency scattering that occurs when the elements are periodically switched, referred to as Space-Time-Coding metasurface (STCM) topology. This type of topology causes impairments to the established communication methods by generating undesirable interference both in frequency and space, which is worsened when using wideband signals. Nevertheless, it has the potential to bring forward useful features for sensing and localization. This work exploits STCM sensing capabilities in target detection, localization, and classification using narrowband downlink pilot signals at the base station (BS). The results of this novel approach reveal the ability to retrieve a scattering point (SP) localization within the sub-centimeter and sub-decimeter accuracy depending on the SP position in space. We also analyze the associated detection and classification probabilities, which show reliable detection performance in the whole analyzed environment. In contrast, the classification is bounded by physical constraints, and we conclude that this method presents a promising approach for future integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) protocols by providing a tool to perform sensing and localization services using legacy communication signals.", "authors": "Herman L. dos Santos, Martin Voigt Vejling, Taufik Abrão, Petar Popovski", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Short-Time Fourier Transform for deblurring Variational Autoencoders", "abstract": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models, however their generated samples are known to suffer from a characteristic blurriness, as compared to the outputs of alternative generating techniques. Extensive research efforts have been made to tackle this problem, and several works have focused on modifying the reconstruction term of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). In particular, many have experimented with augmenting the reconstruction loss with losses in the frequency domain. Such loss functions usually employ the Fourier transform to explicitly penalise the lack of higher frequency components in the generated samples, which are responsible for sharp visual features. In this paper, we explore the aspects of previous such approaches which aren't well understood, and we propose an augmentation to the reconstruction term in response to them. Our reasoning leads us to use the short-time Fourier transform and to emphasise on local phase coherence between the input and output samples.

The axial resolution of OCT is intrinsically constrained by the spectral bandwidth of the employed light source while maintaining a fixed center wavelength for a specific application. Physically extending this bandwidth faces strong limitations and requires a substantial cost. We present a novel computational approach, called as O-PRESS, for boosting the axial resolution of OCT with Prior Guidance, a Recurrent mechanism, and Equivariant Self-Supervision. Diverging from conventional superresolution methods that rely on physical models or data-driven techniques, our method seamlessly integrates OCT modeling and deep learning, enabling us to achieve real-time axial-resolution enhancement exclusively from measurements without a need for paired images. Our approach solves two primary tasks of resolution enhancement and noise reduction with one treatment. Both tasks are executed in a self-supervised manner, with equivariance imaging and free space priors guiding their respective processes. Experimental evaluations, encompassing both quantitative metrics and visual assessments, consistently verify the efficacy and superiority of our approach, which exhibits performance on par with fully supervised methods.

{"title": "Prompt-driven Latent Domain Generalization for Medical Image Classification", "abstract": "Deep learning models for medical image analysis easily suffer from distribution shifts caused by dataset artifacts bias, camera variations, differences in the imaging station, etc., leading to unreliable diagnoses in real-world clinical settings. Domain generalization (DG) methods, which aim to train models on multiple domains to perform well on unseen domains, offer a promising direction to solve the problem. However, existing DG methods assume domain labels of each image are available and accurate, which is typically feasible for only a limited number of medical datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel DG framework for medical image classification without relying on domain labels, called Prompt-driven Latent Domain Generalization (PLDG). PLDG consists of unsupervised domain discovery and prompt learning. This framework first discovers pseudo domain labels by clustering the bias-associated style features, then leverages collaborative domain prompts to guide a Vision Transformer to learn knowledge from discovered diverse domains. To facilitate cross-domain knowledge learning between different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generator that enables knowledge sharing between domain prompts and a shared prompt. A domain mixup strategy is additionally employed for more flexible decision margins and mitigates the risk of incorrect domain assignments. Extensive experiments on three medical image classification tasks and one debiasing task demonstrate that our method can achieve comparable or even superior performance than conventional DG algorithms without relying on domain labels.

Localization of blood vessels in retina images is an important process in medical image analysis. This process is also more challenging with the presence of bright and dark lesions. In this thesis, two automated vessel localization methods to handle both healthy and unhealthy (pathological) retina images are analyzed. Each method consists of two major steps and the second step is the same in the two methods. In the first step, an algorithm is used to decrease the effect of bright lesions. In Method 1, this algorithm is based on K- Means segmentation, and in Method 2, it is based on a regularization procedure. In the second step of both methods, a multi-scale line operator is used to localize the line-shaped vascular structures and ignore the dark lesions which are generally assumed to have irregular patterns. After the introduction of the methods, a detailed quantitative and qualitative comparison of the methods with one another as well as the state-of-the-art solutions in the literature based on the segmentation results on the images of the two publicly available datasets, DRIVE and STARE, is reported.

To address the computational challenges of CS reconstruction, our objective is to develop an interpretable and concise neural network model for reconstructing natural images using CS. We achieve this by mapping one step of the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to a deep network block, representing one iteration of ISTA. To enhance learning ability and incorporate structural diversity, we integrate aggregated residual transformations (ResNeXt) and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanisms into the ISTA block. This block serves as a deep equilibrium layer, connected to a semi-tensor product network (STP-Net) for convenient sampling and providing an initial reconstruction. The resulting model, called MsDC-DEQ-Net, exhibits competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art network-based methods. It significantly reduces storage requirements compared to deep unrolling methods, using only one iteration block instead of multiple iterations. Unlike deep unrolling models, MsDC-DEQ-Net can be iteratively used, gradually improving reconstruction accuracy while considering computation trade-offs.

{"title": "Pheme: Efficient and Conversational Speech Generation", "abstract": "In recent years, speech generation has seen remarkable progress, now achieving one-shot generation capability that is often virtually indistinguishable from real human voice. Integrating such advancements in speech generation with large language models might revolutionize a wide range of applications. However, certain applications, such as assistive conversational systems, require natural and conversational speech generation tools that also operate efficiently in real time. Current state-of-the-art models like VALL-E and SoundStorm, powered by hierarchical neural audio codecs, require large neural components and extensive training data to work well. In contrast, MQTTS aims to build more compact conversational TTS models while capitalizing on smaller-scale real-life conversational speech data. However, its autoregressive nature yields high inference latency and thus limits its real-time usage. In order to mitigate the current limitations of the state-of-the-art TTS models while capitalizing on their strengths, in this work we introduce the Pheme model series that 1) offers compact yet high-performing models, 2) allows for parallel speech generation of 3) natural conversational speech, and 4) it can be trained efficiently on smaller-scale conversational data, cutting data demands by more than 10x but still matching the quality of the autoregressive TTS models.

These variations limit the feasibility and robustness of generalizing population-wise features of eye organs to an unbiased spatial reference. To tackle these limitations, we propose a process for creating high-resolution unbiased eye atlases. First, to restore spatial details from scans with a low through-plane resolution compared to a high in-plane resolution, we apply a deep learning-based super-resolution algorithm. Then, we generate an initial unbiased reference with an iterative metric-based registration using a small portion of subject scans. We register the remaining scans to this template and refine the template using an unsupervised deep probabilistic approach that generates a more expansive deformation field to enhance the organ boundary alignment. We demonstrate this framework using magnetic resonance images across four different MRI tissue contrasts, generating four atlases in separate spatial alignments. For each tissue contrast, we find a significant improvement in the average Dice score across four labeled regions compared to a standard registration framework consisting of rigid, affine, and deformable transformations. These results highlight the effective alignment of eye organs and boundaries using our proposed process.

Previous studies have shown that such a network can be targeted by adversarial attacks causing traffic jams or safety violations ending in collisions. We focus on attacks targeting the V2X communication network used to share vehicle data and consider as well uncertainties due to noise in sensor measurements and communication channels. To combat these, motivated by recent work on the safe control of CAVs, we propose a trust-aware robust event-triggered decentralized control and coordination framework that can provably guarantee safety. We maintain a trust metric for each vehicle in the network computed based on their behavior and used to balance the tradeoff between conservativeness (when deeming every vehicle as untrustworthy) and guaranteed safety and security. It is important to highlight that our framework is invariant to the specific choice of the trust framework. Based on this framework, we propose an attack detection and mitigation scheme which has twofold benefits: (i) the trust framework is immune to false positives, and (ii) it provably guarantees safety against false positive cases.

To alleviate the multi-hop attenuation, the semi-self sensing RIS approach is adopted, wherein sensors are configured at the RIS to receive the radar echo signal. Focusing on the estimation accuracy, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the direction-of-the-angles is derived as the metric for sensing performance. A joint optimization problem on hybrid beamforming and RIS phaseshifts is proposed to minimize the CRB, while maintaining satisfactory communication performance evaluated by the achievable data rate. The CRB minimization problem is first transformed as a more tractable form based on Fisher information matrix (FIM). To solve the complex non-convex problem, a double layer loop algorithm is proposed based on penalty concave-convex procedure (penalty-CCCP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method with two sub-problems. Successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and second order cone (SOC) constraints are employed to tackle the non-convexity in the hybrid beamforming optimization.

{"title": "A Stochastic-MILP dispatch optimization model for Concentrated Solar Thermal under uncertainty", "abstract": "Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) offers a promising solution for large-scale solar energy utilization as Thermal Energy Storage (TES) enables electricity generation independently of daily solar fluctuations, shifting to high-priced electricity intervals. The development of dispatch planning tools is mandatory to account for uncertainties associated with solar irradiation and electricity price forecasts as well as limited storage capacity. This study proposes the Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program (SMILP) to maximize expected profit within a specified scenario space. The SMILP scenario space is generated by different Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function percentiles of the potential solar energy to accumulate in storage and the expected profit is estimated using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. SMILP exhibits robust performance, however, its computational time poses a challenge. Thus, three heuristic solutions are developed which run a set of deterministic optimizations on different historical weather profiles to generate candidate dispatching plans (DPs). The candidate DP with the best average performance on all profiles is then selected. The new methods were applied to a case study for a 115 MW CST plant in South Australia. When the historical database has a limited set of historical weather profiles, the SMILP achieves 6% to 9% higher profit than the closest benchmark when the DP is applied to novel weather conditions. With a large historical weather data, the performance of SMILP and Heuristic-2 becomes nearly identical because the SMILP can only utilize a limited number of trajectories for optimization without becoming computationally infeasible. In this case, Heuristic-2 emerges a practical alternative, since it provides similar average profit in a reasonable time (saving about 7 hours in computing time).", "authors": "Navid Mohammadzadeh, Huy Truong-Ba, Michael E.

To address this issue, in this letter, a pure integral-type phase-locked loop (IPLL) with a damping branch is proposed to replace the traditional PI-type PLL. The equivalent damping coefficient of an IPLL-synchronized inverter is decoupled with the steady-state power angle. As a result, the IPLL-synchronized inverter can stably operate under an ultra-weak grid when the equilibrium point exists.

The traditional channel estimation methods using pilot frames (PF) lead to excessive overhead. To reduce the demand for PF, data frames (DF) can be adopted for joint channel estimation and data recovery. However, the computational complexity of the DF-based methods is prohibitively high. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a joint channel estimation and data recovery (JCD) method assisted by a small number of PF for mmWave massive MIMO systems. The proposed method has two stages. In Stage 1, differing from the traditional PF-based methods, the proposed PF-assisted method is utilized to capture the angle of arrival (AoA) of principal components (PC) of channels. In Stage 2, JCD is designed for parallel implementation based on the multi-user decoupling strategy. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the PF-assisted JCD method can achieve equivalent performance to the Bayesian-optimal DF-based method, while greatly reducing the computational complexity.

Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous success in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies, and extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes. Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to classify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle to capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures of the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in signal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal dependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel characteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation strategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model's robustness to modulation-related features.

However, current literature does not provide information concerning the impact of ideal direct sound representation on externalization, in the context of Ambisonics. This paper aims to assess the importance of the spatial information in the direct sound in the externalization of a sound field when using binaural reproduction. This is done in the spherical harmonics (SH) domain, where an ideal direct sound representation within an otherwise Ambisonics signal is simulated, and its perceived externalization is evaluated in a formal listening test.

To reduce this gap, we propose an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based SemCom system that is compatible with existing digital communication infrastructures. In the considered system, the extracted semantics is quantized by scalar quantizers, transformed into OFDM signal, and then transmitted over the frequency-selective channel. Moreover, we propose a semantic importance measurement method to build the relationship between target task and semantic features. Based on semantic importance, we formulate a sub-carrier and bit allocation problem to maximize communication performance. However, the optimization objective function cannot be accurately characterized using a mathematical expression due to the neural network-based semantic codec. Given the complex nature of the problem, we first propose a low-complexity sub-carrier allocation method that assigns sub-carriers with better channel conditions to more critical semantics. Then, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based bit allocation algorithm with dynamic action space.

As a result, our approach can handle high noise transients and low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of our detection approach is examined using three datasets: seven months of recordings from the Mediterranean Sea containing manually verified ambient noise; several days of manually labelled data collected from the Dominica Island containing approximately 40,000 clicks from multiple sperm whales; and a dataset from the Bahamas containing 1,203 labelled clicks from a single sperm whale.

In order to manage this level of growth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining various improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new technologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network densification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new waveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates significant interference that needs to be handled carefully.

{"title": "An alternative approach for the convolution in time-domain: the taches-algorithms", "abstract": "We present an alternative temporal approach for convolution, providing a new algorithm, called the taches-algorithm. Based on interferences between the successive delayed and amplified output signals associated respectively with the impulses constituting the input signal, the taches-algorithm can give access immediately to the new output sample and have a low latency response even without using vector-based optimisation of the calculation. With the taches-algorithm it seems easy to change (even in real-time) the impulse response while running the calculation, simply by updating the impulse response to use it for next samples, a task rather difficult to achieve using FFT convolution.

{"title": "Socially Compliant Control of Autonomous Vehicles with Application to Eco-Driving", "abstract": "Control design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has mostly focused on achieving a prespecified goal for an individually controlled AV or for a swarm of cooperatively controlled AVs. However, the impact of autonomous driving on human-driven vehicles (HVs) has been largely ignored in AV controller synthesis, which could result in egoistic AV behavior detrimental to the safety of passengers and surrounding traffic. In this study we develop a general framework for socially compliant control design of AVs with a useful metric of social psychology, called social value orientation (SVO), allowing AVs to leverage their impact on the behavior of the following HVs. This is critical since AVs that behave in a socially compliant manner enable human drivers to comprehend their actions and respond appropriately. Within the proposed framework, we define the utilities of the controlled AV and its following vehicle, to be maximized in a weighted fashion determined by the AV's SVO. The utility maximization covers an array of design objectives given the goal of the AV and the benefits for the following HV stemming from the courtesy of socially compliant AV controls. An optimal control problem is then formulated to maximize the utility function defined, which is numerically solved using Pontryagin's minimum principle with optimality guarantees. The methodology developed is applied to synthesize socially compliant control for eco-driving of AVs. A set of numerical results are presented to show the mechanism and effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world experimental data collected on Highway 55 in Minnesota.", "authors": "Shian Wang", "date": " 1 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Energy Sharing among Resources within Electrical Distribution Systems: A Systematic Review", "abstract": "The rapid increase in Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption provides a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency in transportation systems. However, the increasing numbers of EVs pose significant challenges to the electrical grids. In addition, the number of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Microgrids (MGs) is increasing on a global scale to meet the energy demand, consequently changing the energy infrastructure. Recently, energy-sharing methods have been proposed to share excess energy from DERs and EVs in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) and MGs. Accommodating this sharing mechanism with the existing electrical distribution systems is a critical issue concerning the economic, reliability, and resilience aspects. This study examines the ever-changing field of EVCI and the critical role of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in mitigating the problems with grid management that result from unorganized EV charging and intermittency in DER. Also, the possibility of energy sharing in electrical distribution systems for microgrids and EVCI on various energy-sharing methods and algorithms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the application of market clearing algorithms like game theory, double auction theory, blockchain technology, optimization techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other models from the existing literature are presented. This paper discusses the policies, economic benefits, environmental impacts, societal advantages, and challenges in distribution systems related to sharing in EVCI and MGs.

In this work, we develop a holistic and equitable approach to manage UAM air traffic and its community noise impact in urban environments. The proposed approach is a hybrid approach that considers a mix of different noise mitigation strategies, including limiting the number of operations, cruising at higher altitudes, and ambient noise masking. We tackle the problem through the lens of network system control and formulate a multi-objective optimization model for managing traffic flow in a multi-layer UAM network while concurrently pursuing demand fulfillment, noise control, and energy saving.

The role of the public charging station depot is to charge the vehicle, prioritizing the achievement of the desired state of charge (SoC) value for the EV battery or charging till the departure of the EV, whichever occurs first. The integration of cyber and physical components within EVCI defines it as a cyber physical power system (CPPS), increasing its vulnerability to diverse cyber attacks. When an EV interfaces with the EVCI, mutual exchange of data takes place via various communication protocols like the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP), and IEC 61850. Unauthorized access to this data by intruders leads to cyber attacks, potentially resulting in consequences like energy theft, and revenue loss. These scenarios may cause the EVCI to incur higher charges than the actual energy consumed or the EV owners to remit payments that do not correspond adequately to the amount of energy they have consumed.

{"title": "Beyond Subspace Isolation: Many-to-Many Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution", "abstract": "The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.", "authors": "Zeke Zexi Hu, Xiaoming Chen, Vera Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen", "date": " 1 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Robust Control Barrier Functions using Uncertainty Estimation with Application to Mobile Robots", "abstract": "Model uncertainty poses a significant challenge to the implementation of safety-critical control systems. With this as motivation, this paper proposes a safe control design approach that guarantees the robustness of nonlinear feedback systems in the presence of matched or unmatched unmodelled system dynamics and external disturbances. Our approach couples control barrier functions (CBFs) with a new uncertainty/disturbance estimator to ensure robust safety against input and state-dependent model uncertainties. We prove upper bounds on the estimator's error and estimated outputs. We use an uncertainty estimator-based composite feedback control law to adaptively improve robust control performance under hard safety constraints by compensating for the matched uncertainty. Then, we robustify existing CBF constraints with this uncertainty estimate and the estimation error bounds to ensure robust safety via a quadratic program (CBF-QP). We also extend our method to higher-order CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which causes relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbance. We assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a second-order cone (SOC) condition. The proposed robust HOCBFs method is demonstrated in a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem. Finally, the efficacy of our method is experimentally demonstrated on a tracked robot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.", "authors": "Ersin Das, Joel W.

{"title": "Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality in Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis", "abstract": "Multi-modal Learning has attracted widespread attention in medical image analysis. Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is not easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited resources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure the training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing modality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to performance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the clinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation framework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The single-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the multi-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI from the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 0.861 on the test set without missing data, but also yields an AUC of 0.842 when the rate of missing modality is 80\\%. This shows the effectiveness of the approach in dealing with multi-modal data and missing modality.

{"title": "On Approximate Opacity of Stochastic Control Systems", "abstract": "This paper investigates an important class of information-flow security property called opacity for stochastic control systems. Opacity captures whether a system's secret behavior (a subset of the system's behavior that is considered to be critical) can be kept from outside observers. Existing works on opacity for control systems only provide a binary characterization of the system's security level by determining whether the system is opaque or not. In this work, we introduce a quantifiable measure of opacity that considers the likelihood of satisfying opacity for stochastic control systems modeled as general Markov decision processes (gMDPs). We also propose verification methods tailored to the new notions of opacity for finite gMDPs by using value iteration techniques. Then, a new notion called approximate opacity-preserving stochastic simulation relation is proposed, which captures the distance between two systems' behaviors in terms of preserving opacity. Based on this new system relation, we show that one can verify opacity for stochastic control systems using their abstractions (modeled as finite gMDPs).

Supervised deep learning achieves excellent results in cancer image classification, usually through transfer learning. However, these models require large amounts of labelled data and for several types of cancer, large labelled datasets do not exist. In this paper, we demonstrate that a model pre-trained using a self-supervised learning algorithm known as Barlow Twins can outperform the conventional supervised transfer learning pipeline. We juxtapose two base models: i) pretrained in a supervised fashion on ImageNet; ii) pretrained in a self-supervised fashion on ImageNet. Both are subsequently fine tuned on a small labelled skin lesion dataset and evaluated on a large test set. We achieve a mean test accuracy of 70\\% for self-supervised transfer in comparison to 66\\% for supervised transfer. Interestingly, boosting performance further is possible by self-supervised pretraining a second time (on unlabelled skin lesion images) before subsequent fine tuning. This hints at an alternative path to collecting more labelled data in settings where this is challenging - namely just collecting more unlabelled images.

{"title": "Self-supervised Reflective Learning through Self-distillation and Online Clustering for Speaker Representation Learning", "abstract": "Speaker representation learning is critical for modern voice recognition systems. While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data, unsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a scalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning (SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised frameworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online clustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative bottlenecks. Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels through online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the student model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input and model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated via an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past iterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for consistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples. Experiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current iterative approaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single training round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components like noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent improvements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts demonstrate SSRL's effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data.

To address the lack of appliance data, we propose two physics-informed data generators: one for high sampling rate signals (kHz) and another for low sampling rate signals (Hz). These generators rely on prior knowledge of the physics of appliance energy consumption, and are capable of simulating a virtually unlimited number of different appliances and their corresponding signatures for any time period.

In this study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning to integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid tumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to predict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to extract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature representations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for the final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of different image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the information from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image blocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by classification to determine the category of the region.

We present a unified treatment of all of these problems using an approach which converts linear-quadratic problems to matrix-valued linear-linear problems with a positivity constraint. This is done through a system representation where the joint state/input covariance (the outer product in the deterministic case) matrix is the fundamental object. LQ problems then become infinite-dimensional semidefinite programs, and the key tool used is that of linear-conic duality. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) emerge naturally as conal constraints on dual problems. Riccati equations characterize extrema of these special LMIs, and therefore provide solutions to the dual problems. The state-feedback structure of all optimal signals in these problems emerge out of alignment (complementary slackness) conditions between primal and dual problems. Perhaps the new insight gained from this approach is that first LMIs, and then second, Riccati equations arise naturally in dual, rather than primal problems. Furthermore, while traditional LQ problems are set up in $L^2$ spaces of signals, their equivalent covariance-representation problems are most naturally set up in $L^1$ spaces of matrix-valued signals.", "authors": "Bassam Bamieh", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

To achieve this, we deploy image priors in conjunction with appropriate conditioning mechanisms in order to control the image generative process, including natural language text prompts acquired from medical science and applied radiology. We perform experiments and quantitatively evaluate our results on the COVID-19 Radiography Database containing labelled chest X-rays with differing pathologies via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Multi Scale Structural Similarity Metric (MS-SSIM) metrics obtained between real and generated images. The resulting system also exhibits a range of latent capabilities including zero-shot localized disease induction, which are evaluated with real examples from the cheXpert dataset.", "authors": "Ammar A.

{"title": "A Wireless Ear EEG Drowsiness Monitor", "abstract": "Wireless, neural wearables can enable life-saving drowsiness, cognitive, and health monitoring for heavy machinery operators, pilots, and drivers. While existing systems use in-cabin sensors to alert operators before accidents, wearables may enable monitoring across many user environments. Current neural wearables are promising but limited by consumable electrodes and bulky, wired electronics. To improve neural wearable usability, scalability, and enable discreet use in daily and itinerant environments, this work showcases the end-to-end design of the first wireless, in-ear, dry-electrode drowsiness monitoring platform. The proposed platform integrates additive manufacturing processes for gold-plated dry electrodes, user-generic earpiece designs, wireless electronics, and low-complexity machine learning algorithms. To evaluate the platform, thirty-five hours of ExG data were recorded across nine subjects performing repetitive drowsiness-inducing tasks. The data was used to train three, offline classifier models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) and evaluated with three training regimes (user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out). The support vector machine classifier achieved an average accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate for the first time that dry, 3D printed, user-generic electrodes can be used with wireless electronics to rapidly prototype wearable systems and achieve comparable average accuracy (>90%) to existing state-of-the-art in-ear and scalp ExG systems that utilize wet electrodes and wired, benchtop electronics. Further, this work demonstrates the feasibility of using population-trained machine learning models in future, wearable ear ExG applications focused on cognitive health and wellness tracking.", "authors": "Ryan Kaveh, Carolyn Schwendeman, Ana C.

{"title": "Sea ice detection using concurrent multispectral and synthetic aperture radar imagery", "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is the primary data type used for sea ice mapping due to its spatio-temporal coverage and the ability to detect sea ice independent of cloud and lighting conditions. Automatic sea ice detection using SAR imagery remains problematic due to the presence of ambiguous signal and noise within the image. Conversely, ice and water are easily distinguishable using multispectral imagery (MSI), but in the polar regions the ocean's surface is often occluded by cloud or the sun may not appear above the horizon for many months. To address some of these limitations, this paper proposes a new tool trained using concurrent multispectral Visible and SAR imagery for sea Ice Detection (ViSual\\_IceD). ViSual\\_IceD is a convolution neural network (CNN) that builds on the classic U-Net architecture by containing two parallel encoder stages, enabling the fusion and concatenation of MSI and SAR imagery containing different spatial resolutions. The performance of ViSual\\_IceD is compared with U-Net models trained using concatenated MSI and SAR imagery as well as models trained exclusively on MSI or SAR imagery. ViSual\\_IceD outperforms the other networks, with a F1 score 1.60\\% points higher than the next best network, and results indicate that ViSual\\_IceD is selective in the image type it uses during image segmentation. Outputs from ViSual\\_IceD are compared to sea ice concentration products derived from the AMSR2 Passive Microwave (PMW) sensor. Results highlight how ViSual\\_IceD is a useful tool to use in conjunction with PMW data, particularly in coastal regions. As the spatial-temporal coverage of MSI and SAR imagery continues to increase, ViSual\\_IceD provides a new opportunity for robust, accurate sea ice coverage detection in polar regions.", "authors": "Martin S J Rogers, Maria Fox, Andrew Fleming, Louisa van Zeeland, Jeremy Wilkinson, J.

{"title": "Tissue Artifact Segmentation and Severity Analysis for Automated Diagnosis Using Whole Slide Images", "abstract": "Traditionally, pathological analysis and diagnosis are performed by manually eyeballing glass slide specimens under a microscope by an expert. The whole slide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide image enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to computational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are utilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data. Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity automatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity evaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The proposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of six fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This method outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for artifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the evaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the system was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical usability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.", "authors": "Galib Muhammad Shahriar Himel", "date": " 1 Jan 2024 ("},

This framework consists of characterizing the statistics of extreme events by fitting the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to the channel tail, deriving the GPD parameters and their associated CIs, and obtaining the transmission rate within a confidence interval. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the accuracy of the estimated rate obtained through the EVT-based framework considering the confidence interval for the GPD parameters.

In this work, we propose to use tiny neural networks (NNs) to learn the relationship between angle difference-of-arrival (ADoA) measurements and locations of a receiver in an indoor environment. To relieve training data collection efforts, we resort to a self-supervised approach by bootstrapping the training of our neural network through location estimates obtained from a state-of-the-art localization algorithm. We evaluate our scheme via mmWave measurements from indoor 60-GHz double-directional channel sounding. We process the measurements to yield dominant multipath components, use the corresponding angles to compute ADoA values, and finally obtain location fixes.

{"title": "Integrating Edges into U-Net Models with Explainable Activation Maps for Brain Tumor Segmentation using MR Images", "abstract": "Manual delineation of tumor regions from magnetic resonance (MR) images is time-consuming, requires an expert, and is prone to human error. In recent years, deep learning models have been the go-to approach for the segmentation of brain tumors. U-Net and its' variants for semantic segmentation of medical images have achieved good results in the literature. However, U-Net and its' variants tend to over-segment tumor regions and may not accurately segment the tumor edges. The edges of the tumor are as important as the tumor regions for accurate diagnosis, surgical precision, and treatment planning. In the proposed work, the authors aim to extract edges from the ground truth using a derivative-like filter followed by edge reconstruction to obtain an edge ground truth in addition to the brain tumor ground truth. Utilizing both ground truths, the author studies several U-Net and its' variant architectures with and without tumor edges ground truth as a target along with the tumor ground truth for brain tumor segmentation. The author used the BraTS2020 benchmark dataset to perform the study and the results are tabulated for the dice and Hausdorff95 metrics. The mean and median metrics are calculated for the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) regions. Compared to the baseline U-Net and its variants, the models that learned edges along with the tumor regions performed well in core tumor regions in both training and validation datasets. The improved performance of edge-trained models trained on baseline models like U-Net and V-Net achieved performance similar to baseline state-of-the-art models like Swin U-Net and hybrid MR-U-Net. The edge-target trained models are capable of generating edge maps that can be useful for treatment planning.

Determining the appropriate transmission rate to satisfy this ultra-reliability constraint requires deriving the statistics of the channel in the ultra-reliable region and then incorporating these statistics into the rate selection. In this paper, we propose a framework for determining the rate selection for ultra-reliable communications based on the extreme value theory (EVT). We first model the wireless channel at URLLC by estimating the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) best fitting to the tail distribution of the received powers, i.e., the power values below a certain threshold. Then, we determine the maximum transmission rate by incorporating the Pareto distribution into the rate selection function. Finally, we validate the selected rate by computing the resulting error probability.

A critical reason is that these methods represent overlapping events using shared and entangled frame-wise features, which degrades the feature discrimination. To solve the problem, we propose a disentangled feature learning framework to learn a category-specific representation. Specifically, we employ different projectors to learn the frame-wise features for each category. To ensure that these feature does not contain information of other categories, we maximize the common information between frame-wise features within the same category and propose a frame-wise contrastive loss. In addition, considering that the labeled data used by the proposed method is limited, we propose a semi-supervised frame-wise contrastive loss that can leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to achieve feature disentanglement.

{"title": "Self-navigated 3D diffusion MRI using an optimized CAIPI sampling and structured low-rank reconstruction", "abstract": "3D multi-slab acquisitions are an appealing approach for diffusion MRI because they are compatible with the imaging regime delivering optimal SNR efficiency. In conventional 3D multi-slab imaging, shot-to-shot phase variations caused by motion pose challenges due to the use of multi-shot k-space acquisition. Navigator acquisition after each imaging echo is typically employed to correct phase variations, which prolongs scan time and increases the specific absorption rate (SAR). The aim of this study is to develop a highly efficient, self-navigated method to correct for phase variations in 3D multi-slab diffusion MRI without explicitly acquiring navigators. The sampling of each shot is carefully designed to intersect with the central kz plane of each slab, and the multi-shot sampling is optimized for self-navigation performance while retaining decent reconstruction quality. The central kz intersections from all shots are jointly used to reconstruct a 2D phase map for each shot using a structured low-rank constrained reconstruction that leverages the redundancy in shot and coil dimensions. The phase maps are used to eliminate the shot-to-shot phase inconsistency in the final 3D multi-shot reconstruction. We demonstrate the method's efficacy using retrospective simulations and prospectively acquired in-vivo experiments at 1.22 mm and 1.09 mm isotropic resolutions. Compared to conventional navigated 3D multi-slab imaging, the proposed self-navigated method achieves comparable image quality while shortening the scan time by 31.7% and improving the SNR efficiency by 15.5%. The proposed method produces comparable quality of DTI and white matter tractography to conventional navigated 3D multi-slab acquisition with a much shorter scan time.", "authors": "Ziyu Li, Karla L.

Until now, the paths followed by the atoms during the B2 to B19' transformation were imagined as independent shears and shuffles. Here, we propose a simplified hard-sphere atomistic model of phase transformation decomposed into three distinct types of atomic movements. The model's inputs are the Ti and Ni atomic or ionic diameters and the monoclinic angle beta. The outputs are the lattice parameters of the B19' phase and the atomic positions. The results are remarkably close to those reported in the literature from X-ray diffraction experiments or DFT simulations. The hard-sphere model explains the change of enthalpy by the formation of short Ti-Ti bonds in B19'. It is also shown that the value of the monoclinic angle beta close to 97.9 degrees corresponds to the highest molar volume among all the possible hard-sphere monoclinic B19' structures; which suggests that it could be a consequence of a maximization of the vibrational entropy. The hard-sphere model was applied in the special case of absence of monoclinicity to predict the B19 structure. The calculations do not agree well with the B19 structure reported in NiTi alloys; they are however in excellent agreement with the B19 structures reported in other binary alloys, such as in AuTi, PdTi, and AuCd.", "authors": "Cyril Cayron", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

Both values are given randomly and independently from each other, with arbitrary probability densities. Each particle evolves at constant velocity until eventually they meet. When this happens, a perfectly-plastic collision is produced, resulting in a new particle composed by the sum of their masses and the weighted average velocity.The merged particles evolve indistinguishably from the non-merged ones, i.e. they move at constant velocity until a new plastic collision eventually happens. As in any open system, the particles are not confined to any region or reservoir, so as time progresses, they go on to infinity. From this non-equilibrium process, the number of (now, non-identical) final particles, $\\tilde{X}_N$, the distribution of masses of these final particles and the kinetic energy loss from all plastic collisions, is studied. Counterintuitively, the way to achieve the number of final particles and each of their masses does not need to rely on evolving the particle system; this result can be obtained by simply considering the initial conditions. Moreover, they can also be used to obtain an accurate approximation of the energy loss. Finally, I will also present strong evidence for the validity of the following conjecture: $\\langle \\tilde{X}_N \\rangle=\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{k}$ (which behaves as $log(N)+\\gamma$ for large $N$), additionally an explicit expression for the variance will also be given.", "authors": "Daniel Fraiman", "date": " 2 Jan 2024 ("},

To shed light on this behavior, we illustrate that an exactly solvable model reveals that while the single-particle gap remains, the many-body gap does in fact close.

In this contribution we discuss in a tutorial manner a particular technique to systematically derive, for a planar, nonideal interface, matching conditions for the quasi-particle Boltzmann equation. The technique is based on pseudizing the transport problem by two auxiliary interface-free systems and matching Green functions at the interface. Provided quasiparticles exist in the auxiliary systems, the framework can be put onto the semiclassical level and the desired boundary conditions result.

In this system, some of the hexagons exhibit alternate bonds along the Cu-O-Cu exchange paths, while others remain uniform. We found that a long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges when uniform hexagons dominate. However, when the order disappears due to the increase number of alternate-bond hexagons, two different types of paramagnetic states are found. Interestingly, even though their proportions of alternate-bond hexagons are similar, these two paramagnetic states exhibit dramatically different low-temperature specific-heat behaviors, which can be attributed to the properties of a quantum-spin-liquid state versus a trivial paramagnetic state.

The most commonly used methods are the algorithms designed to maximize modularity over different partitions of the network nodes. Using 80 real and random networks from a wide range of contexts, we investigate the extent to which current heuristic modularity maximization algorithms succeed in returning maximum-modularity (optimal) partitions. We evaluate (1) the ratio of the algorithms' output modularity to the maximum modularity for each input graph, and (2) the maximum similarity between their output partition and any optimal partition of that graph. We compare eight existing heuristic algorithms against an exact integer programming method that globally maximizes modularity. The average modularity-based heuristic algorithm returns optimal partitions for only 19.4% of the 80 graphs considered. Additionally, results on adjusted mutual information reveal substantial dissimilarity between the sub-optimal partitions and any optimal partition of the networks in our experiments. More importantly, our results show that near-optimal partitions are often disproportionately dissimilar to any optimal partition. Taken together, our analysis points to a crucial limitation of commonly used modularity-based heuristics for discovering communities: they rarely produce an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal partition. If modularity is to be used for detecting communities, exact or approximate optimization algorithms are recommendable for a more methodologically sound usage of modularity within its applicability limits.", "authors": "Samin Aref, Mahdi Mostajabdaveh, Hriday Chheda", "date": " 28 Feb 2023 ("},

There is a recent interest in studying defects in different biological systems with distinct textures. However, a robust method to directly recognize defects and extract their structural features from various traditional and nontraditional nematic systems remains challenging to date. Here we present a machine learning solution, termed Machine Eye for Defects (MED), for automated defect analysis in images with diverse nematic textures. MED seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art object detection networks, Segment Anything Model, and vision transformer algorithms with tailored computer vision techniques. We show that MED can accurately identify the positions, winding numbers, and orientations of $\\pm 1/2$ defects across distinct cellular contours, sparse vector fields of nematic directors, actin filaments, microtubules, and simulation images of Gay--Berne particles. MED performs faster than conventional defect detection method and can achieve over 90\\% accuracy on recognizing $\\pm1/2$ defects and their orientations from vector fields and experimental tissue images. We further demonstrate that MED can identify defect types that are not included in the training data, such as giant-core defects and defects with higher winding number. Remarkably, MED provides correct structural information about $\\pm 1$ defects, i.e., the phase angle for $+1$ defects and the orientation angle for $-1$ defects.

{"title": "The transition to collective motion in nonreciprocal active matter: coarse graining agent-based models into fluctuating hydrodynamics", "abstract": "Two hallmarks of non-equilibrium systems, from active colloids to animal herds, are agents motility and nonreciprocal interactions. Their interplay creates feedback loops leading to complex spatiotemporal dynamics crucial to understand and control the nonlinear response of active systems. Here, we introduce a minimal model that captures these two features at the microscopic scale, while admitting an exact hydrodynamic theory valid also in the fully-nonlinear regime. Our goal is to account for the fact that animal herds and colloidal swarms are rarely in the thermodynamic limit where particle number fluctuations can be completely ignored. Using statistical mechanics techniques we exactly coarse-grain a nonreciprocal microscopic model into a fluctuating hydrodynamics and use dynamical systems insights to analyze the resulting equations. In the absence of motility, we find two transitions to oscillatory phases occurring via distinct mechanisms: a Hopf bifurcation and a Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC) bifurcation. In the presence of motility, this rigorous approach, complemented by numerical simulations, allows us to quantitatively assess the hitherto neglected impact of inter-species nonreciprocity on a paradigmatic transition in active matter: the emergence of collective motion. When nonreciprocity is weak, we show that flocking is accelerated and bands tend to synchronize with a spatial overlap controlled by nonlinearities. When nonreciprocity is strong, flocking is superseded by a Chase & Rest dynamical phase where each species alternates between a chasing state, when they propagate, and a resting state, when they stand still. Finally, we demonstrate how fluctuations in finite systems can be harnessed to characterize microscopic non-reciprocity from macroscopic time-correlation functions, even in phases where nonreciprocal interactions do not affect the thermodynamic steady-state.", "authors": "David Martin, Daniel Seara, Yael Avni, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli", "date": " 17 Jul 2023 ("},
{"title": "Exotic quantum liquids in Bose-Hubbard models with spatially-modulated symmetries", "abstract": "We investigate the effect that spatially modulated continuous conserved quantities can have on quantum ground states. We do so by introducing a family of one-dimensional local quantum rotor and bosonic models which conserve finite Fourier momenta of the particle number, but not the particle number itself. These correspond to generalizations of the standard Bose-Hubbard model (BHM), and relate to the physics of Bose surfaces. First, we show that while having an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space, such systems feature a non-trivial Hilbert space fragmentation for momenta incommensurate with the lattice. This is linked to the nature of the conserved quantities having a dense spectrum and provides the first such example. We then characterize the zero-temperature phase diagram for both commensurate and incommensurate momenta. In both cases, analytical and numerical calculations predict a phase transition between a gapped (Mott insulating) and quasi-long range order phase; the latter is characterized by a two-species Luttinger liquid in the infrared, but dressed by oscillatory contributions when computing microscopic expectation values. Following a rigorous Villain formulation of the corresponding rotor model, we derive a dual description, from where we estimate the robustness of this phase using renormalization group arguments, where the driving perturbation has ultra-local correlations in space but power law correlations in time. We support this conclusion using an equivalent representation of the system as a two-dimensional vortex gas with modulated Coulomb interactions within a fixed symmetry sector.

This finding contrasts with the results of a prior study conducted on YIG/Pt/CuOx, which reported the opposite effect. On the other hand, when we added the same $CuOx(3nm)$ layer to $YIG/Ti(4nm)$ structures, there was not much change in the spin pumping signal. This occurred because Ti does not generate much orbital current at the $Ti/CuOx$ interface, unlike Pt, due to its weaker spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, when we added the $CuOx(3nm)$ layer to $SiO_{2}/Py(5nm)/Pt(4nm)$ structures, the spin pumping signal increased. However, in $SiO_{2}/CuOx(3nm)/Pt(4nm)/Py(5nm)$ structures, the signal decreased. Finally, we delve into a theoretical analysis of the spin (orbital) Hall effect in YIG/Heavy-metal systems.

In this study, we employ a maximum entropy approach to investigate the universality in various constraint-based metabolic networks of Escherichia coli. Our findings reveal the existence of universal scaling relations across different nutritional environments and metabolic network models, similar to the universality observed in physics. By analyzing single-cell data, we confirm that metabolism of Escherichia coli operates close to the state with maximum Fisher information, which serves as a signature of criticality. This critical state provides functional advantages such as high sensitivity and long-range correlation.

Generally, it is understood to originate from the chiral-anomaly (CA) induced charge pumping between doubly degenerate Weyl nodes.

Here, we report the PHE, magnetoresistance, and thermal transport properties (Seebeck and Nernst coefficients) on the Ag intercalated PdTe$_2$. We observe positive longitudinal magnetoresistance, the linear field dependence of the amplitude of PHE, and a prolate pattern in the parametric plots. The planar Hall resistivity and anisotropic magnetoresitance fits well with theoretical study of CA being the origin of PHE.

After quenching the strength of the transverse field, the effects of quantum coherence are studied by Fisher zeros, rate function and winding number. We find that quantum coherence not only recovers the traditional DQPT related to quantum phase transition, but also generates some entirely new DQPTs which are independent of equilibrium quantum critical point. In these entirely new QDPTs, the line of Fisher zeros cuts the imaginary axis twice, i.e., there are two critical modes, one makes the winding number jump down but another makes it jump up. We also find that the rate function can not be used to describe DQPT at high temperature, because the critical mode no longer dominates.

Different extensions of the trapping region are considered, from infinite to cases of semi infinite and finite intervals. The mean trapping time turns out to be simply the inverse of the trapping rate for infinitely extended trapping zones, while it has a nontrivial form in the semi-infinite case and is undefined for finite domains, due to the appearance of long tails in the trapping time distribution.

Motivated by this fact, we study a recurrent-network model in which neuronal units and synaptic couplings are interacting dynamic variables, with couplings subject to Hebbian modification with decay around quenched random strengths. Rather than assigning a specific role to the plasticity, we use dynamical mean-field theory and other techniques to systematically characterize the neuronal-synaptic dynamics, revealing a rich phase diagram. Adding Hebbian plasticity slows activity in chaotic networks and can induce chaos in otherwise quiescent networks. Anti-Hebbian plasticity quickens activity and produces an oscillatory component. Analysis of the Jacobian shows that Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity push locally unstable modes toward the real and imaginary axes, explaining these behaviors. Both random-matrix and Lyapunov analysis show that strong Hebbian plasticity segregates network timescales into two bands with a slow, synapse-dominated band driving the dynamics, suggesting a flipped view of the network as synapses connected by neurons. For increasing strength, Hebbian plasticity initially raises the complexity of the dynamics, measured by the maximum Lyapunov exponent and attractor dimension, but then decreases these metrics, likely due to the proliferation of stable fixed points. We compute the marginally stable spectra of such fixed points as well as their number, showing exponential growth with network size. In chaotic states with strong Hebbian plasticity, a stable fixed point of neuronal dynamics is destabilized by synaptic dynamics, allowing any neuronal state to be stored as a stable fixed point by halting the plasticity.

Exploiting the state evolution of ASP, we count the number of metastable states in the measure, derive the 1RSB free entropy and find the behavior of the Parisi parameter throughout the spin glass phase.", "authors": "Siyu Chen, Guanhao Huang, Giovanni Piccioli, Lenka Zdeborová", "date": " 12 Aug 2022 ("},
{"title": "Constraints on Phase Transitions in Neutron Star Matter", "abstract": "Recent inference results of the sound velocity in the cores of neutron stars are summarized. Implications for the equation of state and the phase structure of highly compressed baryonic matter are discussed. In view of the strong constraints imposed by the heaviest known pulsars, the equation of state must be very stiff in order to ensure the stability of these extreme objects. This required stiffness limits the possible appearance of phase transitions in neutron star cores. For example, a Bayes factor analysis quantifies strong evidence for squared sound velocities $c_s^2 > 0.1$ in the cores of 2.1 solar-mass and lighter neutron stars. Only weak first-order phase transitions with a small phase coexistence density range $\\Delta\\rho/\\rho < 0.2$ (at 68\\% level) in a Maxwell construction turn out to be still possible within neutron stars. The central baryon densities in even the heaviest neutron stars do not exceed five times the density of normal nuclear matter.

{"title": "Sliding friction and superlubricity of colloidal AFM probes coated by tribo-induced graphitic transfer layers", "abstract": "Colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows to explore sliding friction phenomena in graphite contacts of nominal lateral size up to hundreds of nanometers. It is known that contact formation involves tribo-induced material transfer of graphite flakes from the graphitic substrate to the colloidal probe. In this context, sliding states with nearly-vanishing friction, i.e. superlubricity, may set in. A comprehensive investigation of the transfer layer properties is mandatory to ascertain the origin of superlubricity. Here we explore the friction response of micrometric beads, of different size and pristine surface roughness, sliding on graphite under ambient conditions. We show that such tribosystems undergo a robust transition towards a low-adhesion, low-friction state dominated by mechanical interactions at one dominant tribo-induced nanocontact. Friction force spectroscopy reveals that the nanocontact can be superlubric or dissipative, in fact undergoing a load-driven transition from dissipative stick-slip to continuous superlubric sliding. This behavior is excellently described by the thermally-activated, single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson model. Our results indicate that upon formation of the transfer layer, friction depends on the energy landscape experienced by the topographically-highest tribo-induced nanoasperity. Consistently we find larger dissipation when the tribo-induced nanoasperity is sled against surfaces with higher atomic corrugation than graphite, like MoS2 and WS2, in prototypical Van der Waals layered hetero-junctions.", "authors": "Renato Buzio, Andrea Gerbi, Cristina Bernini, Luca Repetto, Andrea Vanossi", "date": " 3 Oct 2022 ("},

If such black holes originate from rapidly rotating progenitors, the large angular momentum reserve in the star could drive a collapsar-like supernova explosion, hence substantially impacting these characteristics of the black holes in the binary. To examine the effect of stellar rotation on the resulting black hole mass and spin, we conduct a 1D general relativistic study of the end phase of the collapse. We find that the resulting black hole mass at times differ significantly from the previously assumed values. We quantify the dependence of the black hole spin magnitude on the hydrodynamics of the accretion flow, providing analytical relations for calculating the mass and spin based on the progenitor's pre-collapse properties.

Both the light curve fitting and galaxy scaling relationships suggest a central black hole mass in the range of 5.9<logM_BH/M_sun<6.4. A delayed X-ray brightening was found around 590 days after the optical discovery, but shows unusual long-time rising to peak over at least 558 days, which could be coming from delayed accretion of a newly forming debris disk. We report the discovery of delayed radio flares around 1105 days since its discovery, characterized by an initial steep rise of ~>175 days, a flattening lasting about 544 days, and a phase with another steep rise. The rapid rise in radio flux coupled with the slow decay in the X-ray emission points to a delayed launching of outflow, perhaps due to a transition in the accretion state. However, known accretion models can hardly explain the origins of the secondary radio flare that is rising even more rapidly in comparison with the initial one. If confirmed, AT2018cqh would be a rare TDE in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting optical, X-ray and radio flares.

Our analysis focuses on Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) systems and employs the period-average approximation to derive evolution equations of these binary parameters in the Newtonian limit. We find that the binary evolution history can be significantly modulated by the backreaction towards large circular equatorial orbits with reduced termination rate.

In this study, we explore the gas dynamic effects of day-to-night temperature contrasts on the escaping atmosphere of a tidally locked planet. Using a combination of 3D hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer post-processing, we modeled the transmission spectra of the metastable helium triplet. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Increasing the day-night anisotropy leads to a narrowing of the helium line and an increase in the blueshift of the line centroid of a few km~s$^{-1}$. (2) The velocity shift of the line depends on the line-forming altitude, with higher planetary mass-loss rates causing the line to form at higher altitudes, resulting in a more pronounced velocity shift. (3) A critical point of day-night anisotropy comes about when the blueshift saturates, due to turbulent flows generated by outflow material falling back onto the planet's night side. (4) A strong stellar wind and the presence of turbulent flows may induce time variations in the velocity shift. Assuming that the day-night temperature gradient is the main cause of the observed blueshifts in the He-1083~nm triplet, the correlation between the velocity shift and day-night anisotropy provides an opportunity to constrain the temperature gradient of the line-forming region.", "authors": "Fabienne Nail, Antonija Oklopčić, Morgan MacLeod", "date": " 7 Dec 2023 ("},

Mitigation is achieved via time-shifting individual measurements in a data processing step known as time-delay interferometry (TDI). The suppression performance of TDI relies on accurate knowledge and consideration of the delays experienced by the interfering lasers. While considerable efforts have been dedicated to the accurate determination of inter-spacecraft ranging delays, the sources for onboard delays have been either neglected or assumed to be known. Contrary to these assumptions, analog delays of the phasemeter front end and the laser modulator are not only large but also prone to change with temperature and heterodyne frequency. This motivates our proposal for a novel method enabling a calibration of these delays on-ground and in-space, based on minimal functional additions to the receiver architecture. Specifically, we establish a set of calibration measurements and elucidate how these measurements are utilized in data processing, leading to the mitigation of the delays in the TDI Michelson variables. Following a performance analysis of the calibration measurements, proposed calibration scheme is assessed through numerical simulations. We find that in the absence of the calibration scheme, the assumed drifts of the analog delays increase residual laser noise at high frequencies of the LISA measurement band. A single, on-ground calibration of the analog delays leads to an improvement by roughly one order of magnitude, while re-calibration in space may improve performance by yet another order of magnitude. Towards lower frequencies, ranging error is always found to be the limiting factor for which countermeasures are discussed.", "authors": "Philipp Euringer, Niklas Houba, Gerald Hechenblaikner, Oliver Mandel, Francis Soualle, Walter Fichter", "date": " 5 Dec 2023 ("},

Extensions to Ricci notation offer novel representations for entrywise, pagewise, and broadcasting operations popular in EMV frameworks for imaging. Complementing the EMV algebra computable with MATLAB, the RTToolbox demonstrates programmatic and computational efficiency thanks to careful design of tensor and dual-variant index classes.

The stacked data are binned according to the UV luminosity function of these sources, and the average photometry of the UV-selected galaxies is estimated. By fitting modified black bodies and IR model templates to the stacked photometry, average dust temperatures and total IR luminosity are determined. The luminosity-weighted average temperatures are consistent with a weak trend of increasing temperature with redshift found by previous studies. Infrared excess, unobscured, and obscured star formation rate (SFR) values are obtained from the UV and IR luminosities. We see a trend in which dust attenuation increases as UV luminosity decreases. It remains constant as a function of IR luminosities at fixed redshift across the luminosity range of our sources. In comparison to local luminous infrared galaxies with similar SFRs, the higher redshift star-forming galaxies in the sample show a lesser degree of dust attenuation. Finally, the inferred dust attenuation is used to correct the unobscured SFR density in the redshift range $0.6-1.2$.

Moreover, we show that implementing sharing and niching techniques ensures an effective exploration of the parameter space, even in the presence of local optima, always helping to find the global optima. This approach is invaluable in the cosmological context, where exhaustive space exploration of parameters is essential. We use dark energy models to exemplify the use of genetic algorithms in cosmological parameter estimation, including a multimodal problem, and we also show how to use the output of a genetic algorithm to obtain derived cosmological functions.

Recently, a simple system-plus-bath model has been proposed which shows a similar behaviour. Here, we make a general argument as to why such a Page-curve-like entanglement dynamics should be expected to hold generally for system-plus-bath models at small coupling and low temperatures, when the system is initialised in a pure state far from equilibrium. The interaction with the bath will then generate entanglement entropy, but it eventually has to decrease to the value prescribed by the corresponding mean-force Gibbs state. Under those conditions, it is close to the system ground state. We illustrate this on two paradigmatic open-quantum-system models, the exactly solvable harmonic quantum Brownian motion and the spin-boson model, which we study numerically. In the first example we find that the entanglement entropy peaks at intermediate times even if the impurity state stays close to the ground state during the whole evolution.

{"title": "Modeling Current and Future High-Cadence Surveys of Repeating FRB Populations", "abstract": "In recent years, the CHIME (Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment) interferometer has revealed a large number of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), including a sizable population that demonstrates repeating behavior. This transit facility, employing a real-time FRB search pipeline, continually scans the sky with declinations between $-10^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$ for events with fluences $\\gtrapprox 0.4$ Jy ms. We simulate a population of repeating FRBs by performing Monte Carlo simulations of underlying source populations processed through a mock CHIME/FRB observing pipeline. Assuming intrinsic repeater rates follow a Poisson distribution, we test assumptions about the burst populations of the repeater sample, and construct models of the FRB sample assuming various cosmological distributions. We infer the completeness of CHIME/FRB observations as a function of observing cadence and redshifts out to 0.5. We find that, if all simulated bursts have a fixed Poisson probability of repetition over their integrated time of observation, repeating burst detections across comoving volume should continue to grow near linearly on the order of decades. We predict that around 170 of the current CHIME/FRB one-off sources will ultimately repeat. We also make projections for FRB repeaters by future facilities and demonstrate that the number of repeaters they find could saturate on a $\\sim$3 yr timescale.", "authors": "Kyle McGregor, Duncan R.

{"title": "Skyrmions with a high topological number and phase transition in two-dimensional frustrated J1-J2 magnets", "abstract": "With the rapidly expanded field of two-dimensional(2D) magnetic materials, the frustrated magnetic skyrmions are attracting growing interest recently. Here, based on hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice of $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg spins model, we systematically investigate the frustrated skyrmions and phase transition by micromagnetic simulations and first-principles calculations. The results show that four spin phases of antiferromagnetic, labyrinth domain, skyrmion and ferromagnetic textures are determined by the identified ranges of $J_1$-$J_2$. Importantly, skyrmion phase with an increasing topological number ($Q$) covers a wider $J_1$-$J_2$ area. Then, the diameter of skyrmions can be tuned by the frustration strength ($|J_2/J_1|$) or external magnetic field. Besides, a phase transition from N$\\acute{e}$el to Bloch type skyrmion is observed due to the change of the helicity with the variation of $|J_2/J_1|$. Furthermore, as increasing magnetic field, the skyrmions with high $Q$ ($\\ge 3$) tend to split into the ones with $Q=1$, thereby achieving a lower systematic energy. Additionally, we find that the CoCl$_2$ monolayer satisfies the requirement of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ magnet, and the related magnetic behaviors agree with the above conclusions. The frustration-induced skyrmions are stable without the manipulation of temperature and magnetic field. Our results may open a possible way toward spintronic applications based on High-topological-number and nanoscale topological spin textures of skyrmions.", "authors": "Hongliang Hu, Zhong Shen, Zheng Chen, Xiaoping Wu, Tingting Zhong, Changsheng Song", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

This analysis highlight the strong link between linear Boltzmann equations and stochastic optimization methods governed by Markov processes. Thanks to this formalism we can establish the connections between the simulated annealing process and the corresponding mean-field Langevin dynamics characterized by a stochastic gradient descent approach.

{"title": "Loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to quartic order action in ultra slow roll inflation", "abstract": "[Abridged] In contemporary literature, the calculation of modifications to the inflationary scalar power spectrum due to the loops from the higher order interaction terms in the Hamiltonian have led to a discussion regarding the validity of perturbation theory. Recently, there have been efforts to examine the contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the loops arising from the cubic order terms in the action describing the perturbations, specifically in inflationary scenarios that permit an epoch of ultra slow roll (USR). A phase of USR inflation leads to significant observational consequences, such as the copious production of primordial black holes. In this work, we study the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum in a scenario of USR inflation arising due to the quartic order terms in the action describing the scalar perturbations. We compute the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the dominant term in the action at the quartic order. We consider a scenario wherein a phase of USR is sandwiched between two stages of slow roll inflation and analyze the behavior of the loop contributions in terms of the parameters involved. We examine the late, intermediate and early epochs of USR during inflation. In the inflationary scenario involving a late phase of USR, for reasonable choices of the parameters, we show that the loop corrections are negligible for the entire range of wave numbers. In the intermediate case, the contributions from the loops prove to be scale invariant over large scales, and we find that these contributions can amount to 30% of the leading order power spectrum. In the case wherein USR sets in early, we find that the loop contributions could be negative and can dominate the power spectrum at the leading order, which indicates a breakdown of the perturbative expansion.

{"title": "Does rare, noise-induced, bypass transition in plane Couette flow bypass instantons ?", "abstract": "We study rare noise induced paths that go all the way from stable laminar to transitional turbulent plane Couette flow and investigate whether these paths share the properties of classical noise induced transitions. The rare paths from laminar to turbulent flow are computed using Adaptive Multilevel Splitting, a rare event simulation method, and are validated against Direct Numerical Simulations at moderately small energy injection rate. The flow is forced outside its natural scales and redistribute energy to the unforced large scales so that the reactive trajectories display forced streamwise velocity tubes at the natural scale of velocity streaks. As the trajectory proceeds, these tubes gradually grow in amplitude until they cross the separatrix between laminar and turbulent flow. Streamwise vortices are visible after velocity tubes have reached near turbulent amplitude. As the domain size is increased from Lx * Lz=6 *4 to 36*24, spatial localisation then extension of the generated coherent streaks and vortices in the spanwise direction is observed. The paths computed in MFU display many of the characteristics of instantons, that often structure noise induced transitions: concentration of trajectories, exponentially increasing waiting times before transition, and Gumbel distribution of trajectory durations. However, bisections started on the reactive trajectories indicate that the trajectory lack two key ingredients of instantons. They do not visit the neighbourhood of the nearest saddle point and do not display the natural relaxation path from that saddle to transitional wall turbulence. The reactive paths do not concentrate more and more around the same trajectory as energy injection rate is decreased, but instead gradually move in phase space. They might reconnect with instantons at very small energy injection rate and exceedingly long waiting times.", "authors": "Joran Rolland", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

However, light curve systematics related to the satellite's 13.7-day orbit have prevented stellar rotation searches for periods longer than 13 days, putting the majority of stars beyond reach. Machine learning methods have the ability to identify systematics and recover robust signals, enabling us to recover rotation periods up to 35 days for GK dwarfs and 80 days for M dwarfs. We present a catalog of 7245 rotation periods for cool dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone, estimated using convolutional neural networks. We find evidence for structure in the period distribution consistent with prior Kepler and K2 results, including a gap in 10--20-day cool star periods thought to arise from a change in stellar spin-down or activity. Using a combination of spectroscopic and gyrochronologic constraints, we fit stellar evolution models to estimate masses and ages for stars with rotation periods. We find strong correlations between the detectability of rotation in TESS and the effective temperature, age, and metallicity of the stars. Finally, we investigate the relationships between rotation and newly obtained spot filling fractions estimated from APOGEE spectra. Field star spot filling fractions are elevated in the same temperature and period regime where open clusters' magnetic braking stalls, lending support to an internal shear mechanism that can produce both phenomena.", "authors": "Zachary R.

{"title": "Supernova Emission of Secretly Interacting Neutrino Fluid: Theoretical Foundations", "abstract": "Neutrino-neutrino scattering could have a large secret component that would turn neutrinos within a supernova (SN) core into a self-coupled fluid. Neutrino transport within the SN core, emission from its surface, expansion into space, and the flux spectrum and time structure at Earth might all be affected. We examine these questions from first principles. First, diffusive transport differs only by a modified spectral average of the interaction rate. We next study the fluid energy transfer between a hot and a cold blackbody surface in plane-parallel and spherical geometry. The key element is the decoupling process within the radiating bodies, which themselves are taken to be isothermal. For a zero-temperature cold plate, mimicking radiation into free space by the hot plate, the energy flux is 3--4\\% smaller than the usual Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The fluid energy density just outside the hot plate is numerically 0.70 of the standard case, the outflow velocity is the speed of sound $v_s=c/\\sqrt{3}$, conspiring to a nearly unchanged energy flux. Our results provide the crucial boundary condition for the expansion of the self-interacting fluid into space, assuming an isothermal neutrino sphere. We also derive a dynamical solution, assuming the emission suddenly begins at some instant. A neutrino front expands in space with luminal speed, whereas the outflow velocity at the radiating surface asymptotically approaches $v_s$ from above. Asymptotically, one thus recovers the steady-state emission found in the two-plate model. A sudden end to neutrino emission leads to a fireball with constant thickness equal to the duration of neutrino emission.", "authors": "Damiano F. G.

We found that the utilization of the GW approximation based on many-body perturbation theory led to an increase in the band gap, resulting in a quasi-direct gap of 5.35 eV. Additionally, we employed the G0W0 - RP A and G0W0 - BSE approximations to calculate the optical spectra in the absence and in the presence of electron-hole interaction, respectively. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of electron-hole interaction caused a red-shift of the absorption spectrum towards lower energies compared to the spectrum obtained from the G0W0 - RP A approximation. With the electron-hole interaction, it is found that the optical absorption spectra are dominated by the first bound exciton with a significant binding energy 3.07 eV.

For their SED-based star formation rates to be valid, bulk of their H$\\alpha$ + [Nii] emission should come from the central AGNs. This difference in interpretation between this work and past studies, including ours, is particularly supported by the recent deep Chandra X-ray observation.

Progress in this avenue of research have been hampered by the difficulty of separating the dust emission from the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). We demonstrate that dust and CIB may be effectively separated based on their different structure on the sky and use the separation to characterize the structure of diffuse dust emission on angular scales where CIB is a significant component in terms of power. We use scattering transform statistics, the Wavelet Phase Harmonics (WPH), to perform a statistical component separation using Herschel SPIRE observations. This component separation is done only from observational data using non-Gaussian properties as a lever arm, and is done at a single 250 microns frequency. This method, that we validate on mock data, gives us access to non-Gaussian statistics of the interstellar dust and an output dust map essentially free from CIB contamination. Our statistical modelling characterizes the non-Gaussian structure of the diffuse ISM down to the smallest scales observed by Herschel. We recover the power-law shape of the dust power spectrum up to a wavenumber of 2 arcmin$^{-1}$ where the dust signal represents 2 percent of the total power. The output dust map reveals coherent structures at the smallest scales which were hidden by the CIB anisotropies. It opens new observational perspectives on the formation of structure in the diffuse ISM which we discuss with reference to past work.

{"title": "The interplay between feedback, accretion, transport and winds in setting gas-phase metal distribution in galaxies", "abstract": "The recent decade has seen an exponential growth in spatially-resolved metallicity measurements in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. To first order, these measurements are characterised by the slope of the radial metallicity profile, known as the metallicity gradient. In this work, we model the relative role of star formation feedback, gas transport, cosmic gas accretion, and galactic winds in driving radial metallicity profiles and setting the mass-metallicity gradient relation (MZGR). We include a comprehensive treatment of these processes by including them as sources that supply mass, metals, and energy to marginally unstable galactic discs in pressure and energy balance. We show that both feedback and accretion that can drive turbulence and enhance metal-mixing via diffusion are crucial to reproduce the observed MZGR in local galaxies. Metal transport also contributes to setting metallicity profiles, but it is sensitive to the strength of radial gas flows in galaxies. While the mass loading of galactic winds is important to reproduce the mass metallicity relation (MZR), we find that metal mass loading is more important to reproducing the MZGR. Specifically, our model predicts preferential metal enrichment of galactic winds in low-mass galaxies. This conclusion is robust against our adopted scaling of the wind mass-loading factor, uncertainties in measured wind metallicities, and systematics due to metallicity calibrations. Overall, we find that at $z \\sim 0$, galactic winds and metal transport are more important in setting metallicity gradients in low-mass galaxies whereas star formation feedback and gas accretion dominate setting metallicity gradients in massive galaxies.", "authors": "Piyush Sharda, Omri Ginzburg, Mark R.

This model, verified by numerical simulations, excludes binary phase-shift keying modulations for missions requiring pico-meter noise levels at the phase readout, while binary offset carrier modulation, where most of the power has been shifted outside the measurement bandwidth, exhibits superior phase measurement performance. Ranging analyses of the delay-locked loop reveal strong distortion of the pulse shape due to the preceding phase tracking introducing ranging bias variations. Numerical simulations show that these variations, however, which originate from data transitions, are compensated by the delay tracking loop, enabling sub-meter ranging accuracy, irrespective of the modulation type.", "authors": "Philipp Euringer, Gerald Hechenblaikner, Francis Soualle, Walter Fichter", "date": " 23 Feb 2023 ("},
{"title": "The Benchmark M Dwarf Eclipsing Binary CM Draconis With TESS: Spots, Flares and Ultra-Precise Parameters", "abstract": "A gold standard for the study of M dwarfs is the eclipsing binary CM Draconis. It is rare because it is bright ($J_{\\rm mag}=8.5$) and contains twin fully convective stars on an almost perfectly edge-on orbit. Both masses and radii were previously measured to better than $1\\%$ precision, amongst the best known. We use 15 sectors of data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to show that CM Draconis is the gift that keeps on giving. Our paper has three main components. First, we present updated parameters, with radii and masses constrained to previously unheard of precisions of $\\approx 0.06\\%$ and $\\approx 0.12\\%$, respectively. Second, we discover strong and variable spot modulation, suggestive of spot clustering and an activity cycle on the order of $\\approx 4$ years. Third, we discover 163 flares. We find a relationship between the spot modulation and flare rate, with flares more likely to occur when the stars appear brighter. This may be due to a positive correlation between flares and the occurrence of bright spots (plages). The flare rate is surprisingly not reduced during eclipse, but one flare may show evidence of being occulted. We suggest the flares may be preferentially polar, which has positive implications for the habitability of planets orbiting M dwarfs.", "authors": "David V.

{"title": "Enabling discovery of solar system objects in large alert data streams", "abstract": "With the advent of large-scale astronomical surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the number of alerts generated by transient, variable and moving astronomical objects is growing rapidly, reaching millions per night. Concerning solar system minor planets, their identification requires linking the alerts of many observations over a potentially large time, leading to a very large combinatorial number. This work aims to identify new candidates for solar system objects from massive alert data streams produced by large-scale surveys, such as the ZTF and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Our analysis used the Fink alert broker capabilities to reduce the 111,275,131 processed alerts from ZTF between November 2019 and December 2022 to only 389,530 new solar system alert candidates over the same period. We then implemented a linking algorithm, Fink-FAT, to create real-time trajectory candidates from alert data and extract orbital parameters. The analysis was validated on ZTF alert packets linked to confirmed solar system objects from the Minor Planet Center database. Finally, the results were confronted against follow-up observations. Between November 2019 and December 2022, Fink-FAT extracted 327 new orbits from solar system object candidates at the time of the observations, over which 65 were still unreported in the MPC database as of March 2023. After two late follow-up observation campaigns of six orbit candidates, four were associated with known solar system minor planets, and two remain unknown. Fink-FAT is deployed in the Fink broker and successfully analyzes in real time the alert data from the ZTF survey by regularly extracting new candidates for solar system objects. Our scalability tests also show that Fink-FAT can handle the even larger volume of alert data that the Rubin Observatory will send.", "authors": "R. Le Montagner, J. Peloton, B. Carry, J. Desmars, D.

During the last decades, the SNe Ia samples have been improved in number, redshift coverage, calibration methodology, and systematics treatment. These efforts led to the most recent \\textit{``Pantheon\"} (2018) and \\textit{``Pantheon +\"} (2022) releases, which enable to constrain cosmological parameters more precisely than previous samples. In this era of precision cosmology, the community strives to find new ways to reduce uncertainties on cosmological parameters. To this end, we start our investigation even from the likelihood assumption of Gaussianity, implicitly used in this domain. Indeed, the usual practise involves constraining parameters through a Gaussian distance moduli likelihood. This method relies on the implicit assumption that the difference between the distance moduli measured and the ones expected from the cosmological model is Gaussianly distributed. In this work, we test this hypothesis for both the \\textit{Pantheon} and \\textit{Pantheon +} releases. We find that in both cases this requirement is not fulfilled and the actual underlying distributions are a logistic and a Student's t distribution for the \\textit{Pantheon} and \\textit{Pantheon +} data, respectively. When we apply these new likelihoods fitting a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, we significantly reduce the uncertainties on $\\Omega_M$ and $H_0$ of $\\sim 40 \\%$.

{"title": "XQC and CSR constraints on strongly interacting dark matter with spin and velocity dependent cross sections", "abstract": "Dark matter that interacts strongly with baryons can avoid the stringent dark matter direct detection constraints, because, like baryons, they are likely to be absorbed when traversing the rocks, leading to a suppressed flux in deep underground labs. Such strongly interacting dark matter, however, can be probed by dark matter experiments or other experiments operated on the ground level or in the atmosphere. In this paper we carry out systematic analysis of two of these experiments, XQC and CSR, to compute the experimental constraints on the strongly interacting dark matter in the following three scenarios: (1) spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions; (2) different velocity dependent cross sections; (3) different dark matter mass fractions. Some of the scenarios are first analyzed in the literature. We find that the XQC exclusion region has some non-trivial dependencies on the various parameters and the limits in the spin-dependent case is quite different from the spin-independent case. A peculiar region in the parameter space, where the XQC constraint disappears, is also found in our Monte Carlo simulations. This occurs in the case where the interaction cross section is proportional to the square of the velocity. We further compare our XQC and CSR limits to other experimental constraints, and find that a large parameter space is allowed by various experiments if the dark matter mass fraction is sufficiently small, $f_\\chi\\lesssim 10^{-4}$.", "authors": "Yonglin Li, Zuowei Liu, Yilun Xue", "date": " 9 Sep 2022 ("},
{"title": "Black holes shielded by magnetic fields", "abstract": "Black holes (BHs) formed by collapsing and/or merging of magnetized progenitors, have magnetic fields penetrating the event horizon, and there are several possible scenarios. Thus, the no-hair theorem that assumes the outside medium is a vacuum, is not applicable in this case. Bearing this in mind and considering a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$ immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$, we show that all three frequencies related to the equatorial circular orbit of a test particle become imaginary for the orbits of radii $r_B > 2B^{-1}$. It signifies that if a BH is surrounded by a magnetic field of order $B \\sim R_g^{-1}$ (where $R_g$ is the gravitational radius of the BH), a test particle could unable to continue its regular geodesic motion from/at $r > r_B$, hence the accretion disk could not be formed, and the motion of other stellar objects around the BH could be absent. As the BHs are generally detected by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas, a magnetic field of order $B \\sim R_g^{-1}$ could be able to shield a BH in such a way that it could remain undetectable. Motivated with this theoretical investigation and considering the sphere (of radius $r_f$) of magnetic influence around an astrophysical BH, we constrain $B$, above which a magnetized BH could remain undetectable. For example, $M=10^9M_{\\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^6$ G and $M=10M_{\\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^{14}$ G could remain undetectable for $r_f \\sim 10^5R_g$.

{"title": "Standard Model in conformal geometry: local vs gauged scale invariance", "abstract": "We discuss comparatively local versus gauged Weyl symmetry beyond Standard Model (SM) and Einstein gravity and their geometric interpretation. The SM and Einstein gravity admit a natural embedding in Weyl integrable geometry which is a special limit of Weyl conformal (non-metric) geometry. The theory has a {\\it local} Weyl scale symmetry but no associated gauge boson. Unlike previous models with such symmetry, this embedding is truly minimal i.e. with no additional fields beyond SM and underlying geometry. This theory is compared to a similar minimal embedding of SM and Einstein gravity in Weyl conformal geometry (SMW) which has a full {\\it gauged} scale invariance, with an associated Weyl gauge boson. At large field values, both theories give realistic, Starobinsky-Higgs like inflation. The broken phase of the current model is the decoupling limit of the massive Weyl gauge boson of the broken phase of SMW, while the local scale symmetry of the current model is part of the larger gauged scale symmetry of SMW. Hence, the current theory has a gauge embedding in SMW. Unlike in the SMW, we note that in models with local scale symmetry the associated current is trivial, which is a concern for the physical meaning of this symmetry. Therefore, the SMW is a more fundamental UV completion of SM in a full gauge theory of scale invariance that generates Einstein gravity in the (spontaneously) broken phase, as an effective theory.", "authors": "D.

In this paper we propose a model of a scalar field which can explain both EDE and late Dark Energy (DE) in a joined manner without additional fine-tuning. The field features kinetic poles as with alpha-attractors. Our model provides an injection of EDE near matter-radiation equality, and redshifts away shortly after via free-fall, later refreezing to become late-time DE at the present day. Using reasonable estimates of the current constraints on EDE from the literature, we find that the parameter space is narrow but viable. As such our model is readily falsifiable. In contrast to other work in EDE, our model is non-oscillatory, which causes its decay to be faster than that of the usual oscillatory EDE, thereby achieving better agreement with observations.", "authors": "Lucy Brissenden, Konstantinos Dimopoulos, Samuel Sánchez López", "date": " 9 Jan 2023 ("},

The optical (acoustic) plasmon due to an in-phase (out-of-phase) charge oscillation of neighbouring layers exhibits a quadratic (linear) dispersion. Using a model for the Coulomb interaction of the charges in a layered system, it is possible to describe the complete range of plasmon excitations in a mean-field random phase approximation without taking correlation effects into account. There are no signs of over-damped plasmons predicted by holographic theories. This indicates that long wavelength charge excitations are not influenced by local correlation effects such as on-site Coulomb interaction and Hund's exchange interaction.", "authors": "J.

Combined with HARPS and CORALIE spectroscopy, we measure M-dwarf masses with precisions better than 5%, radii better than 3% and effective temperatures on order 1%. However, our fits require invoking a model to derive parameters for the primary star.

In the paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an attribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces influencing the market.

By adding in new factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they examined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The paper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic news, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the significant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by such motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general framework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic factors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.", "authors": "Yue Chen, Mohan Li", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},

Further, if a continuous rough process is present, the function gives an estimate of the roughness index. This is done through an extensive simulation study, where we find that the roughness signature function works as expected on rough processes. We further derive some asymptotic properties of this new signature function. The function is applied empirically to three different volatility measures for the S&P500 index. The three measures are realized volatility, the VIX, and the option-extracted volatility estimator of Todorov (2019).

The receiver is a naive agent who has a simplistic worldview: he ignores the dependency between the two dimensions of the state. We provide a characterization for the sender's gain from persuasion both when the receiver is naive and when he is rational. We show that the receiver benefits from having a simplistic worldview if and only if it makes him perceive the states in which his interest is aligned with the sender as less likely.", "authors": "Maxim Senkov, Toygar T.

{"title": "Asymptotically Optimal Fixed-Budget Best Arm Identification with Variance-Dependent Bounds", "abstract": "We investigate the problem of fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI) for minimizing expected simple regret. In an adaptive experiment, a decision maker draws one of multiple treatment arms based on past observations and observes the outcome of the drawn arm. After the experiment, the decision maker recommends the treatment arm with the highest expected outcome. We evaluate the decision based on the expected simple regret, which is the difference between the expected outcomes of the best arm and the recommended arm. Due to inherent uncertainty, we evaluate the regret using the minimax criterion. First, we derive asymptotic lower bounds for the worst-case expected simple regret, which are characterized by the variances of potential outcomes (leading factor). Based on the lower bounds, we propose the Two-Stage (TS)-Hirano-Imbens-Ridder (HIR) strategy, which utilizes the HIR estimator (Hirano et al., 2003) in recommending the best arm. Our theoretical analysis shows that the TS-HIR strategy is asymptotically minimax optimal, meaning that the leading factor of its worst-case expected simple regret matches our derived worst-case lower bound. Additionally, we consider extensions of our method, such as the asymptotic optimality for the probability of misidentification. Finally, we validate the proposed method's effectiveness through simulations.", "authors": "Masahiro Kato, Masaaki Imaizumi, Takuya Ishihara, Toru Kitagawa", "date": " 6 Feb 2023 ("},

{"title": "Effect on New Loan Repayment Fine Clause on Bank Jaya Artha's Customer Satisfaction and Recommendation", "abstract": "The growing population of older people in Indonesia--the world's fourth-most populous country--makes a larger cake for the pension business, including in the banking sector. PT Bank Jaya Artha is one of the Indonesian banks that provide products and services for people who are set to enter retirement age. In the wake of tight competition in the pension business market, Bank Jaya Artha has since 2019 imposed a fine of three times of installments in addition to 5% of outstanding debt on customers planning to repay their debt in a mission to prevent them from leaving for competitors. While the clause is not included in loan agreements signed before the implementation, it applies to past loan agreements as well. This, in turn, has led to customer complaints. The research is meant to find out how the implementation of the unconsented clause has affected customer satisfaction and willingness to recommend the bank and what the bank should do to become more customer-centric, according to customers. Using a design thinking framework, the research collects quantitative and qualitative data from the bank's pension customers through questionnaires and forum group discussions. Statistical analysis is utilized on quantitative data from questionnaires, and content analysis is utilized on qualitative data from questionnaires. A narrative analysis is also used to explain qualitative data from forum group discussions. The result shows that there are problems in the way the bank communicates information to customers, particularly information about the loan repayment fine. Lack of transparency, a reactive approach instead of a proactive one, the obscurity of the information, and the time the information is delivered have affected customers' satisfaction toward the bank.", "authors": "Mustaqim Adamrah, Yos Sunitiyoso", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

The valuation of the electronic currencies will be based on macroeconomic theory and the fundamental equation of monetary policy, not the microeconomic theory of discounted cash flows. The view of electronic currency as a transactional equity associated with tangible assets of a sub-economy will be developed, in contrast to the view of stock as an equity associated mostly with intangible assets of a sub-economy. The view will be developed of the electronic currency management firm as an entity responsible for coordinated monetary (electronic currency supply and value stabilization) and fiscal (investment and operational) policies of a substantial (for liquidity of the electronic currency) sub-economy. The risk model used in the valuations and the decision-making will not be the ubiquitous, yet inappropriate, exponential risk model that leads to discount rates, but will be multi time scale models that capture the true risk. The decision-making will be approached from the perspective of true systems control based on a system response function given by the multi scale risk model and system controllers that utilize the Deep Reinforcement Learning, Generative Pretrained Transformers, and other methods of Artificial Intelligence (DRL/GPT/AI). Finally, the sub-economy will be viewed as a nonlinear complex physical system with both stable equilibriums that are associated with short-term exploitation, and unstable equilibriums that need to be stabilized with active nonlinear control based on the multi scale system response functions and DRL/GPT/AI.", "authors": "Michael E.

{"title": "Binding potential and wetting behaviour of binary liquid mixtures on surfaces", "abstract": "We present a theory for the interfacial wetting phase behaviour of binary liquid mixtures on rigid solid substrates, applicable to both miscible and immiscible mixtures. In particular, we calculate the binding potential as a function of the adsorptions, i.e. the excess amounts of each of the two liquids at the substrate. The binding potential fully describes the corresponding interfacial thermodynamics. Our approach is based on classical density functional theory. Binary liquid mixtures can exhibit complex bulk phase behaviour, including both liquid-liquid and vapour-liquid phase separation, depending on the nature of the interactions between all the particles of the two different liquids, the temperature and the chemical potentials. Here we show that the interplay between the bulk phase behaviour of the mixture and the properties of the interactions with the substrate gives rise to a wide variety of interfacial phase behaviours, including mixing and demixing situations. We find situations where the final state is a coexistence of up to three different phases. We determine how the liquid density profiles close to the substrate change as the interaction parameters are varied and how these determine the form of the binding potential, which in certain cases can be a multi-valued function of the adsorptions. We also present profiles for sessile droplets of both miscible and immiscible binary liquids.", "authors": "Mounirah Areshi, Dmitri Tseluiko, Uwe Thiele, Benjamin D. Goddard, Andrew J.

{"title": "Revisiting the Landau criterion: a hydrodynamic and holographic approach to superfluid instabilities", "abstract": "In this thesis we investigate the instabilities of superfluids at finite superflow by means of a hydrodynamical approach. We find that at a finite value of the background superfluid velocity a hydrodynamic collective mode crosses to the upper half complex frequency plane, thereby signalling a dynamical instability. At the same time, however, this instability is also thermodynamic, as its onset is controlled by one of the second derivatives of the free energy changing sign. We carry out our analysis in two main setups: the \"probe limit\", where the fluctuations of the temperature and the normal fluid's velocity are frozen, and a complete approach, which includes them. In both cases we test our results with the help of gauge-gravity duality, finding good agreement between the hydrodynamic modes of the boundary theory and the quasinormal modes of the gravity theory. Our criterion for the onset of the instability, which is formulated in a model-independent way, applies to interacting systems irrespective of the strength of interactions, does not rely on boost invariance and does not assume any specific quantum statistics. As a final check, we also show that it yields the Landau critical velocity for Galilean superfluids with Bose-Einstein quasiparticles.", "authors": "Filippo Sottovia", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

We show that the ground state undergoes a first-order phase transition from Mott insulator to breakdown condensate as the breakdown interaction increases. When the normal hopping is zero, this model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by the breakdown condensate, while the Mott-condensate transition remains first order. Surprisingly, the breakdown condensate with spontaneously broken exponential U(1) symmetry does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1D. Moreover, we show that the model at non-equilibrium exhibits a dynamical transition from dielectric phase to breakdown phase with respect to the breakdown interaction. Our results show that quantum systems with exponential symmetry can exhibit novel unexpected properties.", "authors": "Yu-Min Hu, Biao Lian", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

Counter-monotonic allocations take the form of either \"winner-takes-all\" lotteries or \"loser-loses-all\" lotteries, and we respectively refer to these (normalized) cases as jackpot or scapegoat allocations. Our main theorem, the counter-monotonic improvement theorem, states that for a given set of random variables that are either all bounded from below or all bounded from above, one can always find a set of counter-monotonic random variables such that each component is greater or equal than its counterpart in the convex order. We show that Pareto optimal allocations, if they exist, must be jackpot allocations when all agents are risk seeking. We essentially obtain the opposite when all agents have discontinuous Bernoulli utility functions, as scapegoat allocations maximize the probability of being above the discontinuity threshold. We also consider the case of rank-dependent expected utility (RDU) agents and find conditions which guarantee that RDU agents prefer jackpot allocations. We provide an application for the mining of cryptocurrencies and show that in contrast to risk-averse miners, RDU miners with small computing power never join a mining pool. Finally, we characterize the competitive equilibria with risk-seeking agents, providing a first and second fundamental theorem of welfare economics where all equilibrium allocations are jackpot allocations.", "authors": "Jean-Gabriel Lauzier, Liyuan Lin, Ruodu Wang", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Electrodynamics of superconductors: from Lorentz to Galilei at zero temperature", "abstract": "We discuss the derivation of the electrodynamics of superconductors coupled to the electromagnetic field from a Lorentz-invariant bosonic model of Cooper pairs. Our results are obtained at zero temperature where, according to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the system is zero. In the nonrelativistic limit we obtain a Galilei-invariant superconducting system which differs with respect to the familiar Schrödinger-like one. From this point of view, there are similarities with the Pauli equation of fermions which is derived from the Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit and has a spin-magnetic field term in contrast with the Schrödinger equation. One of the peculiar effects of our model is the decay of a static electric field inside a superconductor exactly with the London penetration length. In addition, our theory predicts a modified D'Alembert equation for the massive electromagnetic field also in the case of nonrelativistic superconducting matter. We emphasize the role of the Nambu-Goldstone phase field which is crucial to obtain the collective modes of the superconducting matter field. In the special case of a nonrelativistic neutral superfluid we find a gapless Bogoliubov-like spectrum, while for the charged superfluid we obtain a dispersion relation that is gapped by the plasma frequency.", "authors": "Luca Salasnich", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Incontestable Assignments", "abstract": "Mandatory clearinghouse participation is a standard setting in many school districts, and students can appeal (block) their assignments only with a valid reason. When students do not observe the assignments of other students, claims relying on justified envy are hard to establish. A student's appeal is said to be legitimate if there is no profile of preferences of the other students that can rationalize the student's assignment, and an assignment is incontestable if no student has a legitimate complaint. Incontestability is shown to be equivalent to individual rationality, non-wastefulness, and respect for top-priority sets. This latter property is a weakening of non-justified envy that relates to Hall's marriage theorem. We show that any stable mechanism is incontestable, as well as any mechanism that Pareto dominates a stable mechanism. The Top-Trading Cycle mechanism and some of its variants are incontestable (but Boston is not). Incontestable mechanisms are i-indinstiguishable (Li, 2017), and share many similar incentive properties.", "authors": "Benoit Decerf, Guillaume Haeringer, Martin Van der Linden", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Ion Type Dependence of DNA Electronic Excitation in Water under Proton, alpha-particle, and Carbon Ion Irradiation: A First-Principles Simulation Study", "abstract": "Understanding how the electronic excitation of DNA changes in response to different high-energy particles is central to advancing ion beam cancer therapy. While protons have been the predominant ion of choice in beam cancer therapy, heavier ions, particularly carbon ions, have drawn significant attention over the past decade. Carbon ions are expected to transfer larger amounts of energy accordingly to the linear response theory. However, the molecular-level details of the electronic excitation under heavier ion irradiation remain unknown. In this work, we use real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations to examine the quantum-mechanical details of DNA electronic excitations in water under proton, alpha-particle, and carbon ion irradiation. Our results show that the energy transfer does indeed increase for the heavier ions, while the excitation remains highly conformal. However, the increase in the energy transfer rate, measured by electronic stopping power, does not match the prediction by the linear response model, even when accounting for the velocity-dependence of the irradiating ions charge. The simulations also reveal that while the number of holes generated on DNA increases for heavier ions, the increase is only partially responsible for the larger stopping power. Larger numbers of highly energetic holes formed from the heavier ions also contribute significantly to the increased electronic stopping power.", "authors": "Christopher Shepard, Yosuke Kanai", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

To achieve identification we complement one excluded but possibly endogenous quasi-IV (e.g., ``relevant proxies'' such as previous treatment choice) with one exogenous (conditional on the excluded quasi-IV) but possibly included quasi-IV (e.g., random assignment or exogenous market shocks). In practice, our identification strategy should be attractive since complementary quasi-IVs should be easier to find than standard IVs. Our approach also holds if any of the two quasi-IVs turns out to be a valid IV.", "authors": "Christophe Bruneel-Zupanc, Jad Beyhum", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Is there a size premium for nations?", "abstract": "This paper examines whether there is a premium in country size. We study whether there are significant gains from being a small or a large country in terms of certain socioeconomic indicators and how large this premium is. Using panel data for 200 countries over 50 years, we estimate premia for various sizes of nations across a variety of key economic and socioeconomic performance indicators. We find that smaller countries are richer, have larger governments, and are more prudent in terms of fiscal policies than larger ones. On the other hand, smaller countries seem to be subject to higher absolute and per capita costs for the provision of essential public goods, which may lower their socioeconomic performance in terms of health and education. In terms of economic performance, small countries seem to do better than large countries, compensating for smallness by relying on foreign trade and foreign direct investment. The latter comes at the cost of higher vulnerability to external shocks, resulting in higher volatility of growth rates. This paper's findings offer essential guidance to policymakers, international organizations, and business researchers, especially those assessing a country's economic or socioeconomic performance or potential. The study implies that comparisons with medium-sized or large countries may be of little utility in predicting the performance of small countries.", "authors": "Jože P.

We will assume that the spatial dependence-structure of the processes conditional on the network behaves in the following way: Close vertices (or pairs of vertices) are dependent, while we assume that the dependence decreases conditionally on that the distance in the network increases. We make this intuition mathematically precise by considering three concepts based on correlation, beta-mixing with time-varying beta-coefficients and conditional independence. These concepts allow proving weak-dependence results, e.g. an exponential inequality, which might be of independent interest. In order to demonstrate the use of these concepts in an application we study the asymptotics (for growing networks) of a goodness of fit test in a dynamic interaction network model based on a Cox-type model for counting processes.

{"title": "Droplet morphology-based wettability tuning and design of fog harvesting mesh to minimize mesh-clogging", "abstract": "Fog harvesting relies on intercepting atmospheric or industrial fog by placing a porous obstacle, e.g., a mesh and collecting the deposited water. In the face of global water scarcity, such fog harvesting has emerged as a viable alternative source of potable water. Typical fog harvesting meshes suffer from poor collection efficiency due to aerodynamic bypassing of the oncoming fog stream and poor collection of the deposited water from the mesh. One pestering challenge in this context is the frequent clogging up of mesh pores by the deposited fog water, which not only yields low drainage efficiency but also generates high aerodynamic resistance to the oncoming fog stream, thereby negatively impacting the fog collection efficiency. Minimizing the clogging is possible by rendering the mesh fiber superhydrophobic, but that entails other detrimental effects like premature dripping and flow-induced re-entrainment of water droplets into the fog stream from the mesh fiber. Herein, we improvise on the traditional interweaved metal mesh designs by defining critical parameters, viz., mesh pitch, shade coefficient, and fiber wettability, and deduce their optimal values from numerically and experimentally observed morphology of collected fog-water droplets under various operating scenarios. We extend our investigations over a varying range of mesh-wettability, including superhydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers, and go on to find optimal shade coefficients which would theoretically render clog-proof fog harvesting meshes. The aerodynamic, deposition, and overall collection efficiencies are characterized. Hydrophobic meshes with square pores, having fiber diameters smaller than the capillary length scale of water, and an optimal shade coefficient, are found to be the most effective design of such clog-proof meshes.", "authors": "Arani Mukhopadhyay, Arkadeep Datta, Partha Sarathi Dutta, Amitava Datta, Ranjan Ganguly", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

We solve this equation by converting it into a system of ordinary differential equations with the use of a pole expansion of the Fermi-Dirac function. When the applied voltage exceeds the critical value, the superconductor switches to the normal state. We find that when the voltage is decreased from the normal phase, the system relaxes to a Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type inhomogeneous superconducting state, even in the absence of a magnetic Zeeman field. We point out that the emergence of the LO-type state can be attributed to the nonequilibrium energy distribution of electrons due to the bias voltage.

We discuss how measurement error in test scores generates a biased coefficient of the conditional SES gap, and consider three empirical strategies to address this bias. Using administrative data from the Netherlands, we find that measurement error explains 35 to 43% of the conditional SES gap in track recommendations.", "authors": "Thomas van Huizen, Madelon Jacobs, Matthijs Oosterveen", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Anonymous and Strategy-Proof Voting under Subjective Expected Utility Preferences", "abstract": "We study three axioms in the model of constrained social choice under uncertainty where (i) agents have subjective expected utility preferences over acts and (ii) different states of nature have (possibly) different sets of available outcomes. Anonymity says that agents' names or labels should never play a role in the mechanism used to select the social act. Strategy-proofness requires that reporting one's true preferences be a (weakly) dominant strategy for each agent in the associated direct revelation game. Range unanimity essentially says that a feasible act must be selected by society whenever it is reported as every voter's favorite act within the range of the mechanism. We first show that every social choice function satisfying these three axioms can be factored as a product of voting rules that are either constant or binary (always yielding one of two pre-specified outcomes in each state). We describe four basic types of binary factors: three of these types are novel to this literature and exploit the voters' subjective beliefs. Our characterization result then states that a social choice function is anonymous, strategy-proof and range-unanimous if and only if every binary factor (in its canonical factorization) is of one of these four basic types.", "authors": "Eric Bahel", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

Basic species of one-dimensional solitons, produced by the fractional models which include cubic or quadratic nonlinear terms, are outlined too.

{"title": "Dissipative particle dynamics for coarse-grained models", "abstract": "We develop a computational method based on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) that introduces solvent hydrodynamic interactions to coarse-grained models of solutes, such as ions, molecules, or polymers. DPD-solvent (DPDS) is a fully off-lattice method that allows straightforward incorporation of hydrodynamics at desired solvent viscosity, compressibility and solute diffusivity with any particle-based solute model. Solutes interact with the solvent only through the DPD thermostat, which ensures that the equilibrium properties of the solute system are not affected by the introduction of the DPD solvent. Thus, DPDS can be used as a replacement for traditional molecular dynamics thermostats such as Nosé-Hoover and Langevin. We demonstrate the applicability of DPDS on the case of polymer dynamics and electroosmotic flow through a nanopore. The method should be broadly useful as means to introduce hydrodynamics to existing coarse-grained models of molecules and soft materials.", "authors": "Tine Curk", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

Using various techniques such as intensity correlations, super-localization microscopy or luminescence excitation spectroscopy, we distinguish two pairs of color centers grafted on the same nanotube; the distance between the pairs is on the order of several hundreds of nanometers. In contrast, by studying the strong temporal correlations in the spectral diffusion in the framework of photo-induced Stark effect, we can estimate the distance within each pair to be of the order of a few nanometers. Finally, the electronic population dynamics is investigated using time-resolved luminescence and saturation measurements, showing a biexponential decay with a fast overall recombination (compatible with a fast population transfer between the color centers within a pair) and a weak delayed repopulation of the traps possibly due to the diffusion of excitons along the tube axis.", "authors": "Antoine Borel, Federico Rapisarda, Stephen K.

Comparing the intensity gradients and local gravity with the magnetic field orientations, we find that local gravity plays a dominant role in driving the gas collapse as the magnetic field orientations and gravity vectors seem to point towards the dense clumps. We also find evidence of U-shaped magnetic field morphology towards a small-scale elongated structure associated with the central clump, hinting at converging accretion flows towards the clump. Our observation has resolved the massive clump into multiple substructures. We study the magnetic field properties of two regions, central clump (CC) and northeastern elongated structure (NES).

{"title": "Robust Bayesian Method for Refutable Models", "abstract": "We propose a robust Bayesian method for economic models that can be rejected under some data distributions. The econometrician starts with a structural assumption which can be written as the intersection of several assumptions, and the joint assumption is refutable. To avoid the model rejection, the econometrician first takes a stance on which assumption $j$ is likely to be violated and considers a measurement of the degree of violation of this assumption $j$. She then considers a (marginal) prior belief on the degree of violation $(\\pi_{m_j})$: She considers a class of prior distributions $\\pi_s$ on all economic structures such that all $\\pi_s$ have the same marginal distribution $\\pi_m$. Compared to the standard nonparametric Bayesian method that puts a single prior on all economic structures, the robust Bayesian method imposes a single marginal prior distribution on the degree of violation. As a result, the robust Bayesian method allows the econometrician to take a stance only on the likeliness of violation of assumption $j$. Compared to the frequentist approach to relax the refutable assumption, the robust Bayesian method is transparent on the econometrician's stance of choosing models. We also show that many frequentists' ways to relax the refutable assumption can be found equivalent to particular choices of robust Bayesian prior classes. We use the local average treatment effect (LATE) in the potential outcome framework as the leading illustrating example.", "authors": "Moyu Liao", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "The inherent goodness of well educated intelligence", "abstract": "This paper will examine what makes a being intelligent, whether that be a biological being or an artificial silicon being on a computer. Special attention will be paid to the being having the ability to characterize and control a collective system of many identical conservative sub-systems conservatively interacting. The essence of intelligence will be found to be the golden rule -- \"the collective acts as one\" or \"knowing the global consequences of local actions\". The flow of the collective is a small set of twinkling textures, that are governed by a puppeteer who is pulling a small number of strings according to a geodesic motion of least action, determined by the symmetries. Controlling collective conservative systems is difficult and has historically been done by adding significant viscosity to the system to stabilize the desirable meta stable equilibriums of maximum performance, but it degrades or destroys them in the process. There is an alternative. Once the optimum twinkling textures of the meta stable equilibriums are identified by the intelligent being (that is the collective system is characterized), the collective system can be moved by the intelligent being to the optimum twinkling textures, then quickly vibrated by the intelligent being according to the textures so that the collective system remains at the meta stable equilibrium. Well educated intelligence knows the global consequences of its local actions so that it will not take short term actions that will lead to poor long term outcomes. In contrast, trained intelligence or trained stupidity will optimize its short term actions, leading to poor long term outcomes. Well educated intelligence is inherently good, but trained stupidity is inherently evil and should be feared. Particular attention is paid to the control and optimization of economic and social collectives.", "authors": "Michael E. Glinsky, Sharon Sievert", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

An orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition was observed to occur between 5 and 7 GPa, with a large volume collapse of nearly 11% and a nearest U-U distance increase by about 4%. This lower to higher symmetry transition suggests less 5f electron participation in bonding when the weakly correlated superconducting phase in the tetragonal structure of UTe$_2$ appears. Beyond 7 GPa, no new structural transitions were found up to 30 GPa. The resonant x-ray emission spectra clearly demonstrate an intermediate valence of U, nearly +3.74 at 1.8 GPa and room temperature, and reveal that the U valence shifts towards 4+, passes through a peak at 2.8 GPa, and then decreases towards 3+ and settles down to a nearly constant value above 15 GPa.

We trigger quantum crystallisation by preparing a Mott insulator with one exciton in every site of a shallow artificial lattice. In turn, the Mott phase self-defines a dipolar anti-lattice where additional excitons are confined and spontaneously realise a checkerboard solid at half-filling. We evidence that strong dipolar correlations effectively bound excitonic Mott and checkerboard phases, while screening the artificial lattice confinement. Our observations thus show that lattice models with extended interactions provide a fertile ground to emulate Wigner crystallisation.", "authors": "Camille Lagoin, Kirk Baldwin, Loren Pfeiffer, Francois Dubin", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the significant impact of phonon-magnon scattering on the thermal conductivity of the rare-earth metal gadolinium near room temperature, which can be controlled by a magnetic field to realize thermal switching. Using first-principles lattice dynamics and spin-lattice dynamics simulations, we attribute the observed change in phononic thermal conductivity to field-suppressed phonon-magnon scattering.

This implies, counter-intuitively, that in two dimensions, such a \"super-Coulombic\" gas undergoes the same Kosterlitz-Thouless transition as a conventional Coulomb gas at an elevated temperature that we calculate. We also predict that above two dimensions, even when naively the bare potential is confining, there is no confined phase of the plasma at any nonzero temperature. In addition, we show that power-law potentials that fall off more rapidly than Coulombic are screened down to a shorter ranged power-law, rather than an exponential Debye-Huckel Yukawa form.

Here, we train four machine-learned force fields for equiatomic NiTi based on the LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN DFT functionals. The models are trained on the fly during NPT molecular dynamics, with DFT calculations and model updates performed automatically whenever the uncertainty of a local energy prediction exceeds a chosen threshold. The models achieve accuracies of 1-2 meV/atom during training and are shown to closely track DFT predictions of B2 and B19' elastic constants and phonon frequencies. Surprisingly, in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, only the SCAN model predicts a reversible B19' -> B2 phase transition, with the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol models predicting a reversible transition to a previously uncharacterized low-volume phase, which we hypothesize to be a new stable high-pressure phase. We examine the structure of the new phase and estimate its stability on the temperature-pressure phase diagram.

The wire-wire coupling is either perpendicular or diagonal hopping respecting the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries. The hybridization to substrate renormalizes the model parameters of the wires towards the hopping parameter of the substrate without changing the basic nature of perpendicular or diagonal coupling and it can mediate effective perpendicular hopping but not diagonal hopping in the absence of direct wire-wire coupling. This justifies the investigation of multi uniform tight binding wires with perpendicular or diagonal hopping parameters while neglecting the substrate. Perpendicularly coupled uniform wires reveal anisotropic two dimensional band dispersion. Diagonally coupled uniform wires reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel to the wires direction if the intra-wire hopping parameter is larger than twice the diagonal hopping parameter despite strong dispersion perpendicular to the wires. Otherwise, they reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel and perpendicular to the wires direction simultaneously. We established the possibility of realizing strictly one dimensional properties emerging from dispersive two dimensional system if time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries are respected.

In the present study, we expand upon the analysis of binary colloid mixtures and additionally introduce a third particle species to further our understanding of colloidal systems. Gravitationally driven, spherical colloids immersed in an implicit solvent are confined in two-dimensional linear microchannels. The interaction between the colloids is modeled by the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential, and the confinement of the colloids is realized by hard walls based on the solution of the Smoluchowski equation in half space. In binary and ternary colloidal systems, a difference in the driving force is achieved by differing colloid sizes, but fixed mass density. We observe for both the binary and ternary systems that a driving force difference induces a nonequilibrium phase transition to lanes. For ternary systems, we study the tendency of lane formation in dependence of the diameter of the medium-sized colloids. Here, we find a sweetspot for lane formation in ternary systems. Furthermore, we study the interaction of two differently sized colloids at the channel walls. Recently, we observed that driven large colloids push smaller colloids to the walls. This results in small particle lanes at the walls at early simulation times. In this work, we additionally find that thin lanes are unstable and dissolve over very long time frames. Furthermore, we observe a connection between lane formation and the nonuniform distribution of particles along the channel length.

Under conditions of strong coupling, we observe the emergence of distinct resonances and explain them within a Fano model. For atoms arranged on a lattice, we predict the strong continuum coupling to even stabilize molecules consisting of more than two atoms and find first signatures of these by observing atom loss correlations using a quantum gas microscope. Our results present an intriguing mechanism to control decoherence and bind multiatomic molecules using strong light-matter interactions.", "authors": "Simon Hollerith, Valentin Walther, Kritsana Srakaew, David Wei, Daniel Adler, Suchita Agrawal, Pascal Weckesser, Immanuel Bloch, Johannes Zeiher", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A Universal Scaling Law for Intrinsic Fracture Energy of Networks", "abstract": "Networks of interconnected materials permeate throughout nature, biology, and technology due to exceptional mechanical performance. Despite the importance of failure resistance in network design and utility, no existing physical model effectively links strand mechanics and connectivity to predict bulk fracture. Here, we reveal a universal scaling law that bridges these levels to predict the intrinsic fracture energy of diverse networks. Simulations and experiments demonstrate its remarkable applicability to a breadth of strand constitutive behaviors, topologies, dimensionalities, and length scales. We show that local strand rupture and nonlocal energy release contribute synergistically to the measured intrinsic fracture energy in networks. These effects coordinate such that the intrinsic fracture energy scales independent of the energy to rupture a strand; it instead depends on the strand rupture force, breaking length, and connectivity. Our scaling law establishes a physical basis for understanding network fracture and a framework for fabricating tough materials from networks across multiple length scales.", "authors": "Chase Hartquist, Shu Wang, Qiaodong Cui, Wojciech Matusik, Bolei Deng, Xuanhe Zhao", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

Our theoretical investigations not only provide interesting insights but also highlight the promise of Janus MCrCT$_2$ (M = Ti, Mo; T = O, F, OH) MXenes for future spintronic applications and highlight the need for their synthesis. Electronic structure analysis shows different metallic and semi-metallic properties: MoCrCF$_2$ exhibits metallic properties, TiCrC(OH)$_2$ and MoCrCO$_2$ exhibit near semi-metallicity with spin polarization values of 61\\% and 86\\%, respectively, while TiCrCO$_2$ and TiCrCF$_2$ are completely half-metallic with 100\\% spin polarization at the Fermi level. All studied Janus MXenes exhibit intrinsic ferromagnetism, which is mainly attributed to the chromium (Cr) atoms, as shown by the spin density difference plots. Among them, the TiCrCO$_2$ monolayer stands out with the highest exchange constant and ferromagnetic transition temperature (T$_c$). Notably, the O-terminated Janus MXenes exhibit weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, in contrast to the in-plane anisotropy observed for F and OH-terminated MXenes, making them particularly interesting for future spintronic applications which we further demonstrate with micromagnetic simulation which reveal distinct current-induced switching behaviors in these Janus MXenes with different surface terminations.", "authors": "Swetarekha Ram, Namitha Anna Koshi, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Interactions between dynamic team composition and coordination: An agent-based modeling approach", "abstract": "This paper examines the interactions between selected coordination modes and dynamic team composition, and their joint effects on task performance under different task complexity and individual learning conditions. Prior research often treats dynamic team composition as a consequence of suboptimal organizational design choices. The emergence of new organizational forms that consciously employ teams that change their composition periodically challenges this perspective. In this paper, we follow the contingency theory and characterize dynamic team composition as a design choice that interacts with other choices such as the coordination mode, and with additional contextual factors such as individual learning and task complexity. We employ an agent-based modeling approach based on the NK framework, which includes a reinforcement learning mechanism, a recurring team formation mechanism based on signaling, and three different coordination modes. Our results suggest that by implementing lateral communication or sequential decision-making, teams may exploit the benefits of dynamic composition more than if decision-making is fully autonomous. The choice of a proper coordination mode, however, is partly moderated by the task complexity and individual learning. Additionally, we show that only a coordination mode based on lateral communication may prevent the negative effects of individual learning.", "authors": "Darío Blanco-Fernández, Stephan Leitner, Alexandra Rausch", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

In this work we present an experimental magneto-optical study of the low-energy excitation spectrum in FePSe3, together with its theoretical description. The observed response contains several types of magnon excitations. Two of them are conventional transverse magnons described by a classical theory of antiferromagnetic resonance. Two other modes are identified as multimagnon hexadecapole excitations with an anomalous g factor approximately equal to four times the g factor of a single Fe^2+ ion. These quasiparticles correspond to full reversals of iron spins that coherently propagate in the up-down antiferromagnetic structure. They constitute a novel type of collective excitations in anisotropic magnetic solids, called longitudinal magnons. Comparison between theory and experiment allows us to estimate the microscopic parameters of FePSe3 including exchange coupling constants and the single-ion anisotropy.", "authors": "F.

Our measurements on a dispersion of silica nanoparticles once again revealed the phenomenology commonly observed for such systems: the formation of a porous solid with linear growth in the channel at short times, slowing down at longer times as the evaporation rate decreases. The growth of the solid is also accompanied by mechanical stresses that are released by the delamination of the solid from the channel walls and the formation of cracks. In addition to these observations, we report original measurements using hydrophilic filler in the PDMS formulation used (Sylgard-184). When the PDMS matrix is in contact with water, water molecules pool around these hydrophilic sites, resulting in the formation of microscopic water clusters whose size depends on the water potential $\\psi$. In our work, we have used these water clusters to estimate the water potential profile in the channel as the porous solid grows. Using a transport model that also takes into account solid delamination in the channel, we then linked these water potential measurements to the hydraulic permeability of the porous solid. These measurements finally enabled us to show that the slowdown in the evaporation rate is due to the invasion of the porous solid by air/water nanomenisci at a critical capillary pressure $\\psi_\\text{cap}$.", "authors": "Hrishikesh Pingulkar, Sonia Maréchal, Jean-Baptiste Salmon", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

This interesting, but little-studied system, allows us to identify characteristic features of the regime, some of which are also present in strongly-correlated materials relevant to the industry. Furthermore, our findings describe the behavior of electrons in quantum dots, ions in Paul traps, and even fermionic atoms in one-dimensional optical lattices. Near the ground state, all these platforms can be described as fermions trapped in a harmonic potential. The correlation regime can be controlled by varying the natural frequency of the trapping potential, and to probe it, we propose to use twisted light. We identify 4 signatures of strong correlation in the one-dimensional 3-fermion trap, which are likely to be present for any number N of trapped fermions: i) the ground state density is strongly localized with N maximally separated peaks (Wigner Crystal) ii) the symmetric and antisymmetric ground state wavefunctions become degenerate (bosonization) iii) the von Neumann entropy grows, iv) the energy spectrum is fully characterized by N normal modes or less.", "authors": "Victor Caliva, Johanna I Fuks", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

We extend the classic principal component analysis technique for the estimation of a low-rank structure to the estimation of a large covariance matrix of random functions that satisfies a notion of (approximate) functional \"low-rank plus sparse\" structure; and generalise the matrix shrinkage method to functional shrinkage in order to estimate the sparse structure of functional idiosyncratic components. Under appropriate regularity conditions, we derive the large sample theory of the developed estimators, including the consistency of the estimated factors and functional factor loadings and the convergence rates of the estimated matrices of covariance functions measured by various (functional) matrix norms. Consistent selection of the number of factors and a data-driven rule to choose the shrinkage parameter are discussed.

These models aim at preserving interactions among coarse-grained variables in a manner that mirrors the underlying atomistic description. We explore here a method for testing coarse-grained vs. all-atom models using stiffness matrices in Fourier space ($q$-stiffnesses), which are particularly suited to probe DNA elasticity at different length scales. We focus on a class of coarse-grained rigid base DNA models known as cgDNA and its most recent version cgDNA+. Our analysis shows that while cgDNA+ follows closely the $q$-stiffnesses of the all-atom model, the original cgDNA shows some deviations for twist and bending variables which are rather strong in the $q \\to 0$ (long length scale) limit. The consequence is that while both cgDNA and cgDNA+ give a suitable description of local elastic behavior, the former misses some effects which manifest themselves at longer length scales. In particular, cgDNA performs poorly on the twist stiffness with a value much lower than expected for long DNA molecules. Conversely, the all-atom and cgDNA+ twist is strongly length scale dependent: DNA is torsionally soft at a few base pair distances, but becomes more rigid at distances of a few dozens base pairs. Our analysis shows that the bending persistence length in all-atom and cgDNA+ is somewhat overestimated.", "authors": "Wout Laeremans, Midas Segers, Aderik Voorspoels, Enrico Carlon, Jef Hooyberghs", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

We apply it to reconstruct physical quantities in some quantum many-body perturbative expansions in the real time Keldysh formalism, considered as a function of time $t$ and interaction $U$. These functions are of remarkably low rank. This property, combined with the convergence of the perturbative expansion in $U$ both at finite $t$ (for any $U$), and small $U$ (for any $t$), is sufficient for our algorithm to reconstruct the physical quantity at long time, strong coupling regime. Our method constitutes an alternative to standard resummation techniques in perturbative methods, such as diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo.

Following Syrwid, Kosior, and Sacha (SKS), the notion is that a precise position measurement of one particle can lead to spontaneous formation of a bright soliton that in a time crystal should rotate intact for at least a few revolutions around the ring. In their work SKS find spontaneous formation of a soliton due to the position measurement, but quantum fluctuations cause the soliton to subsequently decay before it has a chance to perform even one revolution of the ring. Based on this they conclude that time crystal dynamics are impossible. In contrast, for our few boson chiral soliton model, and allowing for imprecise (weak) measurements of the particle position, we show that time crystal behavior is possible allowing for several revolutions of the spontaneously formed soliton around the ring. We therefore argue that our chiral soliton model can realize a quantum time crystal when weak position measurements are allowed for.", "authors": "Patrik Ohberg, Ewan M Wright", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

Their practical utility is determined by two conflicting properties: high dielectric constants tend to occur in materials with narrow band gaps, limiting the operating voltage before dielectric breakdown. We present a high-throughput workflow that combines element substitution, ML pre-screening, ab initio simulation and human expert intuition to efficiently explore the vast space of unknown materials for potential dielectrics, leading to the synthesis and characterization of two novel dielectric materials, CsTaTeO6 and Bi2Zr2O7. Our key idea is to deploy ML in a multi-objective optimization setting with concave Pareto front. While usually considered more challenging than single-objective optimization, we argue and show preliminary evidence that the $1/x$-correlation between band gap and permittivity in fact makes the task more amenable to ML methods by allowing separate models for band gap and permittivity to each operate in regions of good training support while still predicting materials of exceptional merit. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of successful ML-guided multi-objective materials optimization achieving experimental synthesis and characterization. CsTaTeO6 is a structure generated via element substitution not present in our reference data sources, thus exemplifying successful de-novo materials design.

We find a rich spectrum of signals, many of which can be classified by their angular periodicity. The sample shows an oscillation with a period of 180$^{\\circ}$ (i.e. two-fold periodicity) which we argue is due to residual strain within the crystal, rather than being intrinsic. In addition, within the magnetically ordered zigzag phase there is a 60$^{\\circ}$ period (i.e. six-fold) sawtooth pattern, which can be explained by reorientation of the zigzag domains as the crystal rotates in the applied field. Suppressing the zigzag order with an applied field above ${\\sim}$ 8 T at low temperature, a six-fold sinusoidal signal remains, suggesting that there is fluctuating zigzag order in the putative field-induced quantum spin liquid state. Finally, our key finding is a sharp, step-like feature that appears at low temperature for fields just above the zigzag phase boundary, at the so-called B2-axes. This is similar to theoretically predicted behaviour for a state with Ising topological order, which is expected for a Kitaev spin liquid in an applied magnetic field.", "authors": "Shaun Froude-Powers, Subin Kim, Jacob Gordon, Hae-Young Kee, Young-June Kim, Stephen R.

{"title": "3D model for surface accumulation of chiral and non-chiral microswimmers", "abstract": "Persistent motion of microswimmers near boundaries is known to result in surface accumulation. Recently it was shown experimentally that surface accumulation of microswimmers is impacted primarily by steric forces and short-ranged hydrodynamics. A way to control surface accumulation is by reducing the contact surface area between swimmers and surface by modifying its topography, typically through the application of microscale structure. In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional(3D) model of a microswimmer navigating a volume bounded by a top and bottom surface. We describe the swimmer-surface interaction with an effective short-ranged hydrodynamic alignment force, and study numerically the effect of surface textures, modelled by convex obstacles, on the surface accumulation of chiral and non-chiral microswimmers. We find that, depending on the angular velocity of the swimmer, and the alignment force, convex obstacles can either hinder or enhance surface accumulation.

{"title": "On the flattening trend of thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7 at ultra-high temperatures", "abstract": "Many crystals, such as lanthanum zirconate (La2Zr2O7), exhibit a flattening trend in thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon has recently been attributed to the inter-band phonon tunneling (or diffuson) contribution using different formalisms. However, the contributions of finite-temperature corrections (e.g., higher-order phonon-scattering, phonon renormalization, and phonon scattering cross-section softening effects) remain unclear. In this work, we predict and compare the thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7 using three distinct first-principles methods. The first method is Green-Kubo molecular dynamics (MD) based on temperature-dependent machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained from ab initio MD simulations, which successfully predict the flattening trend at ultra-high temperatures. The second method is the Peierls Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), within the phonon particle framework, using phonon lifetime that includes all the finite-temperature corrections. Four-phonon scattering is found large but is cancelled by the phonon scattering cross-section softening effect. As a result, BTE with temperature corrections does not reproduce the flattening of thermal conductivity. The third method is Wigner formalism, which includes both phonon particle and wave contributions, which successfully reproduce the flattening of thermal conductivity. Diffuson and phonon contribute about 67% and 28% of thermal conductivity at 1800 K, respectively. The radiation contribution to thermal conductivity is around 5%. The scaling laws of the phonon, diffuson, radiation, and total thermal conductivity are found to be ~T^-1, ~T^0.4, ~T^2, and ~T^-0.4, respectively.

Using large-scale scale hydrodynamics simulations, we study a system consisting of spherical microswimmers within a 3-dimensional nematic liquid crystal. We observe a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, where the uniform nematic state is kneaded into a continously twisting state, corresponding to a helical director configuration akin to a cholesteric liquid crystal. The transition arises from the hydrodynamic coupling between the liquid crystalline elasticity and the swimmer flow fields, leading to a twist-bend instability of the nematic order. It is observed for both pusher (extensile) and puller (contractile) swimmers.

The magnetic sublayers and their magnetic ordering strongly modify the electronic coupling between layers of the host compound. Understanding the roots of this variability is a significant challenge. Here we employ the angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy at various photon energies, the {\\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations, and modeling to address the particular case of Ni-intercalate, Ni$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. We find that the bands around the Fermi level bear the signature of a strong yet unusual hybridization between NbS$_2$ conduction band states and the Ni 3$d$ orbitals. The hybridization between metallic NbS$_2$ layers is almost entirely suppressed in the central part of the Brillouin zone, including the part of the Fermi surface around the $\\mathrm{\\Gamma}$ point. Simultaneously, it gets very pronounced towards the zone edges. It is shown that this behavior is the consequence of the rather exceptional, {\\it symmetry imposed}, spatially strongly varying, {\\it zero total} hybridization between relevant Ni magnetic orbitals and the neighboring Nb orbitals that constitute the metallic bands. We also report the presence of the so-called $\\beta$-feature, discovered only recently in two other magnetic intercalates with very different magnetic orderings.

Relaxing this assumption, and using well-established econometric methods to search for the optimal threshold in a data-driven way, we find that the happiness-income relationship does plateau, but at the threshold $\\$$200,000 per year. This finding holds regardless of the part of the happiness distribution considered.", "authors": "Mikkel Bennedsen", "date": " 2 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Principles of 2D terahertz spectroscopy of collective excitations: the case of Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors", "abstract": "Two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS), a terahertz analogue of nuclear magnetic resonance, is a new technique poised to address many open questions in complex condensed matter systems. The conventional theoretical framework used ubiquitously for interpreting multidimensional spectra of discrete quantum level systems is, however, insufficient for the continua of collective excitations in strongly correlated materials. Here, we develop a theory for 2DTS of a model collective excitation, the Josephson plasma resonance in layered superconductors. Starting from a mean-field approach at temperatures well below the superconducting phase transition, we obtain expressions for the multidimensional nonlinear responses that are amenable to intuition derived from the conventional single-mode scenario. We then consider temperatures near the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, where dynamics beyond mean-field become important and conventional intuition fails. As fluctuations proliferate near $T_c$, the dominant contribution to nonlinear response comes from an optical parametric drive of counter-propagating Josephson plasmons, which gives rise to 2D spectra that are qualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. As such, and in contrast to one-dimensional spectroscopy techniques, such as third harmonic generation, 2DTS can be used to directly probe thermally excited finite-momentum plasmons and their interactions. Our theory provides a clear interpretation of recent 2DTS measurements on cuprates, and we discuss implications beyond the present context of Josephson plasmons.", "authors": "Alex Gómez Salvador, Pavel E.

{"title": "Biofilm mechanics and patterns", "abstract": "From multicellular tissues to bacterial colonies, three dimensional cellular structures arise through the interaction of cellular activities and mechanical forces. Simple bacterial communities provide model systems for analyzing such interaction. Biofilms are bacterial aggregates attached to wet surfaces and encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix. Biofilms in flows form filamentary structures that contrast with the wrinkled layers observed on air/solid interfaces. We are able to reproduce both types of shapes through elastic rod and plate models that incorporate information from the biomass production and differentiations process, such as growth rates, growth tensors or inner stresses, as well as constraints imposed by the interaction with environment. A more precise study of biofilm dynamics requires tackling water absorption from its surroundings and fluid transport within the biological system. This process alters the material properties of the biofilm and the overall stresses. We analyze whether poroelastic approaches can provide a suitable combined description of fluid-like and solid-like biofilm behavior.", "authors": "Ana Carpio, Elena Cebrian, David R.

Using a parallel implementation of the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to simulate the system on a supercomputer, I show that local densities and currents can be calculated in a matter of days rather than weeks. The precision of these numerics allows me to observe deviations from the conjectured power-law decay and to determine the effects of the harmonic trapping potential.

{"title": "Non-Gaussian diffusive fluctuations in Dirac fluids", "abstract": "Dirac fluids - interacting systems obeying particle-hole symmetry and Lorentz invariance - are among the simplest hydrodynamic systems; they have also been studied as effective descriptions of transport in strongly interacting Dirac semimetals. Direct experimental signatures of the Dirac fluid are elusive, as its charge transport is diffusive as in conventional metals. In this paper we point out a striking consequence of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics: the full counting statistics (FCS) of charge transport is highly non-gaussian. We predict the exact asymptotic form of the FCS, which generalizes a result previously derived for certain interacting integrable systems. A consequence is that, starting from quasi-one dimensional nonequilibrium initial conditions, charge noise in the hydrodynamic regime is parametrically enhanced relative to that in conventional diffusive metals.", "authors": "Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

Using the Carreau model to describe the shear-dependent viscosity, we identify the key dimensionless rheological number, $Cu$, which characterizes shear thinning, and we show that our experiments lie within the power-law regime of shear rates. To rationalize the experimental data, we derive the flow rate--pressure drop relation taking into account the two-way-coupled fluid--structure interaction between the flow and its compliant confining boundaries. We thus identify the second key dimensionless number, $\\alpha$, which characterizes the compliance of the conduit. We then compare the theoretical flow rate--pressure drop relation to our experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement between the two. We further contrast our results for shear-thinning and Newtonian fluids to highlight the influence of $Cu$ on the flow rate--pressure drop relation. Finally, we delineate four distinct physical regimes of flow and deformation by mapping our experimental flow rate--pressure drop data for Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids into a $Cu-\\alpha$ plane.", "authors": "SungGyu Chun, Evgeniy Boyko, Ivan C.

Quantum simulation of quasiparticles arising from atom-ion hybrid systems may shed light on solid-state uncharted regimes. Here we investigate the ionic Fermi polaron consisting of a charged impurity interacting with a polarized Fermi bath. Employing state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo techniques tailored for strongly correlated systems, we characterize the charged quasiparticle by computing the energy spectrum, quasiparticle residue, and effective mass, as well as the structural properties of the system. Our findings in the weak coupling regime agree with field-theory predictions within the ladder approximation. However, stark deviations emerge in the strongly interacting regime attributed to the vastly large density inhomogeneity around the ion, resulting in strong correlations for distances on the order of the atom-ion potential range. Moreover, we find a smooth polaron-molecule transition for strong coupling, in contrast with the neutral case, where the transition smoothens only for finite temperature and finite impurity density.

{"title": "Should you hire new searchers? Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them", "abstract": "Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively look for a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this letter, we consider a collective search cost that not only accounts for the search time but also for the cost associated to the creation and the maintenance of an agent. We first present a general formalism for independent agents in terms of the survival probability of the target for a single-agent search s(t), where we allow agents to be introduced in the system one after the other. From this, we first derive analytically the optimal number of searchers to launch initially in the system. Then, we identify the optimal strategies for exponential and algebraic single-agent survival probabilities by pointing out the ideal times at which new searchers should be launched in the system. Our results show that all searchers should be launched simultaneously in the exponential case, while some should be launched at later times in the algebraic case. Finally, we compare these results with numerical simulations of a strongly interacting collective search, the true self-avoiding walk, and show how the optimal strategy differ from the non-interacting case.", "authors": "Hugues Meyer, Heiko Rieger", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

We explore what happens when external parties -- who we call ``game miners'' -- discover this fact and seek to profit from it by entering an outcome-contingent contract with the players. We analyze various structured bargaining games between miners and players for determining such an outcome-contingent contract. These bargaining games include playing the players against one another, as well as allowing the players to pay the miner(s) for exclusivity and first-mover advantage. We establish restrictions on the strategic settings in which a game miner can profit and bounds on the game miner's profit. We also find that game miners can lead to both efficient and inefficient equilibria.", "authors": "James W. Bono, David H. Wolpert", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Classification and Treatment Learning with Constraints via Composite Heaviside Optimization: a Progressive MIP Method", "abstract": "This paper proposes a Heaviside composite optimization approach and presents a progressive (mixed) integer programming (PIP) method for solving multi-class classification and multi-action treatment problems with constraints. A Heaviside composite function is a composite of a Heaviside function (i.e., the indicator function of either the open $( \\, 0,\\infty )$ or closed $[ \\, 0,\\infty \\, )$ interval) with a possibly nondifferentiable function. Modeling-wise, we show how Heaviside composite optimization provides a unified formulation for learning the optimal multi-class classification and multi-action treatment rules, subject to rule-dependent constraints stipulating a variety of domain restrictions. A Heaviside composite function has an equivalent discrete formulation, and the resulting optimization problem can in principle be solved by integer programming (IP) methods. Nevertheless, for constrained learning problems with large data sets, a straightforward application of off-the-shelf IP solvers is usually ineffective in achieving global optimality. To alleviate such a computational burden, our major contribution is the proposal of the PIP method by leveraging the effectiveness of state-of-the-art IP solvers for problems of modest sizes. We provide the theoretical advantage of the PIP method with the connection to continuous optimization and show that the computed solution is locally optimal for a broad class of Heaviside composite optimization problems.

Our improved IVX-based test includes three steps to tackle all the issues above regarding finite sample bias and variance terms. Thus, the test statistics perform well in size control, while its power performance is comparable with the original IVX.

Most of the existing literature on platform recommendation algorithms largely focuses on user preferences and decisions, and does not simultaneously address creator incentives. We propose a model of content recommendation that explicitly focuses on the dynamics of user-content matching, with the novel property that both users and creators may leave the platform permanently if they do not experience sufficient engagement. In our model, each player decides to participate at each time step based on utilities derived from the current match: users based on alignment of the recommended content with their preferences, and creators based on their audience size. We show that a user-centric greedy algorithm that does not consider creator departures can result in arbitrarily poor total engagement, relative to an algorithm that maximizes total engagement while accounting for two-sided departures. Moreover, in stark contrast to the case where only users or only creators leave the platform, we prove that with two-sided departures, approximating maximum total engagement within any constant factor is NP-hard. We present two practical algorithms, one with performance guarantees under mild assumptions on user preferences, and another that tends to outperform algorithms that ignore two-sided departures in practice.", "authors": "Daniel Huttenlocher, Hannah Li, Liang Lyu, Asuman Ozdaglar, James Siderius", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

However, the resulting responses may suffer from the influence of the intrinsic aspects of the respondent's personality and emotional context at the time of the interview. This study proposes a methodology to generate and select control variables for these latent psychosituational traits, thus mitigating the risk of omitted variable bias. We developed an econometric model of the determinants of passenger satisfaction in a survey conducted at the largest airport in Latin America, São Paulo GRU Airport. Our focus was on the role of flight delays in the perception of quality. The results of this study confirm the existence of a relationship between flight delays and the global satisfaction of passengers with airports. In addition, favorable evaluations regarding airports' food/beverage concessions and Wi-Fi services, but not their retail options, have a relevant moderating effect on that relationship. Furthermore, dissatisfaction arising from passengers' interaction with the airline can have negative spillover effects on their satisfaction with the airport. We also found evidence of blame-attribution behavior, in which only delays of internal origin, such as failures in flight management, are significant, indicating that passengers overlook weather-related flight delays. Finally, the results suggest that an empirical specification that does not consider the latent psychosituational traits of passengers produces a relevant overestimation of the absolute effect of flight delays on passenger satisfaction.", "authors": "Alessandro V.

Confidence sets (CS) of the true parameters are derived by inverting these tests. However, they often lack analytical expressions, necessitating a grid search to obtain the CS numerically by retaining the grid points that pass the test. When the statistic is not asymptotically pivotal, constructing the critical value for each grid point in the parameter space adds to the computational burden. In this paper, we convert the computational issue into a classification problem by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Its decision function provides a faster and more systematic way of dividing the parameter space into two regions: inside vs. outside of the confidence set. We label those points in the CS as 1 and those outside as -1. Researchers can train the SVM classifier on a grid of manageable size and use it to determine whether points on denser grids are in the CS or not. We establish certain conditions for the grid so that there is a tuning that allows us to asymptotically reproduce the test in the CS. This means that in the limit, a point is classified as belonging to the confidence set if and only if it is labeled as 1 by the SVM.", "authors": "Lujie Zhou", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

In recent years, my efforts in minimalist market design led to the 2021 reform of the US Army's branching system for its cadets to military specialties, the adoption of reserve systems during the Covid-19 pandemic for vaccine allocation in 15 states and therapies in 2 states, and the deployment of a highly efficient liver exchange system in Türkiye. This same methodology also predicted the rescission of a 1995 Supreme Court judgment in India, resulting in countless litigations and interruptions of public recruitment for 25 years, as well as the mandates of its replacement. In this monograph, I describe the philosophy, evolution, and successful applications of minimalist market design, contrasting it with the mainstream paradigm for the field. In doing so, I also provide a paradigm for economists who want to influence policy and change institutions through their research.", "authors": "Tayfun Sönmez", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Actualised and future changes in regional economic growth through sea level rise", "abstract": "This study investigates the long-term economic impact of sea-level rise (SLR) on coastal regions in Europe, focusing on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Using a novel dataset covering regional SLR and economic growth from 1900 to 2020, we quantify the relationships between SLR and regional GDP per capita across 79 coastal EU & UK regions. Our results reveal that the current SLR has already negatively influenced GDP of coastal regions, leading to a cumulative 4.7% loss at 39 cm of SLR. Over the 120 year period studied, the actualised impact of SLR on the annual growth rate is between -0.02% and 0.04%. Extrapolating these findings to future climate and socio-economic scenarios, we show that in the absence of additional adaptation measures, GDP losses by 2100 could range between -6.3% and -20.8% under the most extreme SLR scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5 High-end Ice, or -4.0% to -14.1% in SSP5-RCP8.5 High Ice). This statistical analysis utilising a century-long dataset, provides an empirical foundation for designing region-specific climate adaptation strategies to mitigate economic damages caused by SLR. Our evidence supports the argument for strategically relocating assets and establishing coastal setback zones when it is economically preferable and socially agreeable, given that protection investments have an economic impact.", "authors": "Theodoros Chatzivasileiadis, Ignasi Cortes Arbues, Jochen Hinkel, Daniel Lincke, Richard S.J.

{"title": "Forecasting CPI inflation under economic policy and geo-political uncertainties", "abstract": "Forecasting a key macroeconomic variable, consumer price index (CPI) inflation, for BRIC countries using economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk is a difficult proposition for policymakers at the central banks. This study proposes a novel filtered ensemble wavelet neural network (FEWNet) that can produce reliable long-term forecasts for CPI inflation. The proposal applies a maximum overlapping discrete wavelet transform to the CPI inflation series to obtain high-frequency and low-frequency signals. All the wavelet-transformed series and filtered exogenous variables are fed into downstream autoregressive neural networks to make the final ensemble forecast. Theoretically, we show that FEWNet reduces the empirical risk compared to single, fully connected neural networks. We also demonstrate that the rolling-window real-time forecasts obtained from the proposed algorithm are significantly more accurate than benchmark forecasting methods. Additionally, we use conformal prediction intervals to quantify the uncertainty associated with the forecasts generated by the proposed approach. The excellent performance of FEWNet can be attributed to its capacity to effectively capture non-linearities and long-range dependencies in the data through its adaptable architecture.", "authors": "Shovon Sengupta, Tanujit Chakraborty, Sunny Kumar Singh", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

The findings show that there is a moderate association between decreased costs of starting a business and growth of FDI. Mauritius, South Africa and the DRC reduced their total cost of starting a business by 71.7%, 143.7% and 122.9% for the entire period, and saw inward FDI increases of 167.6%, 79.8% and 152.21%, respectively.

{"title": "Migdal-Eliashberg superconductivity in a Kondo lattice", "abstract": "We apply the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity to heavy-fermion and mixed valence materials. Specifically, we extend the Anderson lattice model to a case when there exists a strong coupling between itinerant electrons and lattice vibrations. Using the saddle-point approximation, we derive a set of coupled nonlinear equations which describe competition between the crossover to a heavy-fermion or mixed-valence regimes and conventional superconductivity. We find that superconductivity at strong coupling emerges on par with the development of the many-body coherence in a Kondo lattice. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed with the onset of the Kondo screening and for strong electron-phonon coupling the Kondo screening exhibits a characteristic re-entrant behavior. Even though for both weak and strong coupling limits the suppression of superconductivity is weaker in the mixed-valence regime compared to the local moment one, superconducting critical temperature still remains nonzero. In the weak coupling limit the onset of the many body coherence develops gradually, in the strong coupling limit it emerges abruptly in the mixed valence regime while in the local moment regime the $f$-electrons remain effectively decoupled from the conduction electrons. Possibility of experimental realization of these effects in Ce-based compounds is also discussed.", "authors": "Samuel Awelewa, Maxim Dzero", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

Unlike in twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonians, we show that TMDs do not exhibit flat bands. The flatness in TMDs for small twisting angles is due to spatial confinement by a matrix-valued potential. We show that by generalizing semiclassical techniques developed by Simon [Si83] and Helffer-Sjöstrand [HS84] to matrix-valued potentials, there exists a wide range of model parameters such that the low-lying bands are of exponentially small width in the twisting angle, topologically trivial, and obey a harmonic oscillator-type spacing with explicit parameters.", "authors": "Simon Becker, Mengxuan Yang", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

The lower driving force arises from the vicinity of a spinodal instability in the solid and from a strain energy. The lower interfacial tension implies that the Tolman lengths associated with melting and freezing have opposite signs, a phenomenon that we interpret with Turnbull's rule.

This search resulted in a sample of 46 stars with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity within the Galactic bulge, of which 4 are prime candidate HVSs with high-proper motions consistent with being ejections from the Galactic centre. Adding to that, we studied a sample of reddened stars without a Gaia DR3 counterpart and found 481 stars with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity, from which 65 stars have proper motions pointing out of the Galactic centre and are candidate HVSs.

It is known that these systems have non-coplanar ground states that assume a cuboctahedral structure in the absence of a magnetic field. When a magnetic field $H$ is switched on, a rich variety of different phases develops from the cuboctahedral ground state, which are studied in their dependence on $H$ and a cross-plaquette coupling constant $J_3>0$. For the AF square-kagomé spin lattice, we carefully identify and describe seven phases that appear in a phase diagram with five triple points. The transitions between these phases are predominantly discontinuous, although two cases exhibit continuous transitions. In contrast, the phase diagram of the AF/FM square-kagomé model shows only four phases with a single triple point, but these also lead to exotic magnetization curves.

We explore the topological properties of Floquet insulators possessing a DCS which either does or does not survive upon taking the static limit. We consider the case of harmonic drives and employ a general framework using the quasi-energy operator in frequency space. We find that for a DCS with no static analog, the presence of driving has a negligible impact on the topological phases associated with zero quasi-energy. In stark contrast, topological gaps can open at $\\pi$ quasi-energy and mainly occur at momenta where the driving perturbation vanishes. We confirm the above general predictions for an extended Kitaev chain model in the BDI symmetry class. Another possibility that opens up when adding the drive, while preserving chiral symmetry, is symmetry-class conversion. We demonstrate such an effect for a static CI class Hamiltonian which is topologically trivial in 1D. By considering a suitable driving, we obtain a CI$\\rightarrow$AIII transition, which now enables the system to harbor topological $\\pi$-modes.

Atom and photon degrees of freedom are treated on equal footing within an exact time-dependent configuration interaction scheme, and cavity leakage is included by including classical oscillator baths. For optical lattices, we consider few bosons in short chains, described via the Bose-Hubbard model with two levels per site, and we find that the spectral response grows on increasing the number of atoms at weak interactions, but diminishes at high interactions (if the number of chain sites does not exceed the number of atoms), and is shifted to lower frequency. In the BEC regime, the spectra display at noticeable extent a scaling behavior with the number of particles and a suitable rescaling of the BEC-cavity and inter-particle interactions, whilst the SHG spectrum redshifts at large atom-atom correlations.

This technical bottleneck has been preventing further development of the exciting field beyond a few available vdW samples. To overcome this challenge and facilitate future expansion, we developed a new tear-and-stack method using a strongly adhesive polycaprolactone (PCL). With similar angular accuracy, our technology allows fabrication without a capping layer, facilitating surface analysis and ensuring inherently clean interfaces and low operating temperatures. More importantly, it can be applied to many other vdW materials that have remained inaccessible with the PPC-based method.

{"title": "Discovery of a hybrid topological quantum state in an elemental solid", "abstract": "Topology and interactions are foundational concepts in the modern understanding of quantum matter. Their nexus yields three significant research directions: competition between distinct interactions, as in the multiple intertwined phases, interplay between interactions and topology that drives the phenomena in twisted layered materials and topological magnets, and the coalescence of multiple topological orders to generate distinct novel phases. The first two examples have grown into major areas of research, while the last example remains mostly untouched, mainly because of the lack of a material platform for experimental studies. Here, using tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical analysis, we unveil a \"hybrid\" and yet novel topological phase of matter in the simple elemental solid arsenic. Through a unique bulk-surface-edge correspondence, we uncover that arsenic features a conjoined strong and higher-order topology, stabilizing a hybrid topological phase. While momentum-space spectroscopy measurements show signs of topological surface states, real-space microscopy measurements unravel a unique geometry of topology-induced step edge conduction channels revealed on various forms of natural nanostructures on the surface. Using theoretical models, we show that the existence of gapless step edge states in arsenic relies on the simultaneous presence of both a nontrivial strong Z2 invariant and a nontrivial higher-order topological invariant, providing experimental evidence for hybrid topology and its realization in a single crystal. Our discovery highlights pathways to explore the interplay of different kinds of band topology and harness the associated topological conduction channels in future engineered quantum or nano-devices.", "authors": "Md Shafayat Hossain, Frank Schindler, Rajibul Islam, Zahir Muhammad, Yu-Xiao Jiang, Zi-Jia Cheng, Qi Zhang, Tao Hou, Hongyu Chen, Maksim Litskevich, Brian Casas, Jia-Xin Yin, Tyler A.

The observed capacity decay of LiNiO$_2$ has been attributed to the formation of structural defects via Li/Ni cation mixing that reduces cyclability and leads to poor capacity retention. Herein, we investigate the kinetics and thermodynamics of Li/Ni mixing in ideal LiNiO$_2$ and off-stoichiometric Li$_{1-z}$Ni$_{1+z}$O$_2$. We find that ideal LiNiO$_2$ is stable against cation mixing with similar characteristics as LiCoO$_2$. Li/Ni mixing is promoted by extra Ni in the Li layers that cannot be avoided in synthesis. Our study elucidates the crucial role of extra Ni atoms on Li sites in the cation mixing mechanism, an insight that can inform the development of Co-free cathode materials.", "authors": "Cem Komurcuoglu, Yunhao Xiao, Xinhao Li, Joaquin Rodriguez-Lopez, Zheng Li, Alan C.

{"title": "Voltage dependent first-principles barriers to Li transport within Li-ion battery Solid-Electrolyte-Interphases", "abstract": "Charging a Li-ion battery requires Li ion transport between the cathode and the anode. This Li-ion transport is dependent upon (among other factors) the electrostatic environment the ion encounters within the Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase (SEI), which separates the anode from the surrounding electrolyte. Previous first principles work has illuminated the reaction barriers through likely atomistic SEI environments, but has had difficulty accurately reflecting the larger electrostatic potential landscape that an ion encounters moving through the SEI. In this work, we apply the recently developed Quantum Continuum Approximation (QCA) technique to provide an equilibrium electronic potentiostat for first-principles interface calculations. Using QCA, we calculate the potential barrier for Li-ion transport through LiF, Li$_2$O, and Li$_2$CO$_3$ SEIs along with LiF-LiF, and LiF-Li$_2$O grain boundaries, all paired with Li metal anodes. We demonstrate that the SEI potential barrier is dependent on the anode electrochemical potentials in each system. Furthermore, we find that the threshold potential at which the SEI potential barrier switches from encouraging Li ion transport toward the anode versus discouraging transport toward the anode is highly dependent on the exact SEI chemistry. Finally, we use these techniques to estimate the change in the diffusion barrier for a Li ion moving in a LiF SEI as a function of anode potential.", "authors": "Quinn T.

{"title": "Anomalous dispersion, superluminality and instabilities in two-flavour theories with local non-Hermitian mass mixing", "abstract": "Pseudo-Hermitian field theories possess a global continuous ``similarity'' symmetry, interconnecting the theories with the same physical particle content and an identical mass spectrum. In their regimes with real spectra, within this family of similarity transformations, there is a map from the non-Hermitian theory to its Hermitian similarity partner. We promote the similarity transformation to a local symmetry, which requires the introduction of a new vector similarity field as a connection in the similarity space of non-Hermitian theories. In the case of non-Hermitian two-flavour scalar or fermion mixing, and by virtue of a novel IR/UV mixing effect, the effect of inhomogeneous non-Hermiticity then reveals itself via anomalous dispersion, instabilities and superluminal group velocities at very high momenta, thus setting an upper bound on the particle momentum propagating through inhomogeneous backgrounds characterised by Lagrangians with non-Hermitian mass matrices. Such a non-Hermitian extension of the Standard Model of particle physics, encoded in a weak inhomogeneity of the non-Hermitian part of the fermion mass matrix, may nevertheless provide us with a low-energy particle spectrum consistent with experimentally observed properties.", "authors": "Maxim N.

Our findings demonstrate that both the field-like (FL) and damping-like (DL) components of SOT in CCP can efficiently induce ultrafast magnetization reversal without any symmetry-breaking means. For a wide frequency range of the CCP, the minimal current density obtained is significantly smaller compared to the current density of conventional SOT-reversal. This ultrafast reversal is due to the CCP triggering enhanced energy absorption (emission) of the magnetization from (to) the FL- and DL-components of SOT before (after) crossing over the energy barrier. We also verified the robustness of the CCP-driven magnetization reversal at room temperature. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to switch the magnetic states of perpendicular synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) and ferrimagnetic (SFi) nanodevices. Therefore, these studies enrich the basic understanding of field-free SOT-reversal and provide a novel way to realize ultrafast SOT-MRAM devices with various free layer designs: ferromagnetic, SAF, and SFi.", "authors": "Y.

By median stacking the radio images (to include the dominant fraction of individually radio non-detected RQQs) of Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (VLASS) for subsamples of RQQs with different $w_{\\rm 90}$, our study demonstrates that, the correlation between $w_{\\rm 90}$ and radio emission in our SDSS RQQs is significant, and remains solid after controlling the effects of black hole mass, quasar luminosity, Eddington ratio and redshift. This intrinsic link supports that the [O III] outflows in quasars, most likely resulted from wide-angled sub-relativistic quasar winds launched from the accretion disc, could make a dominant contribution to radio emission in the general RQQs. Alternatively, the correlation may be attributed to low-power jets in RQQs if they are ubiquitous and could efficiently enhance the [O III] width through interacting with the ISM. Meanwhile, the star-formation rates traced by the flux ratio of [Ne V]/[O II] emission lines display no dependence on $w_{\\rm 90}$ after controlling the effects of black hole mass, quasar luminosity, Eddington ratio and redshift. This suggests that the stronger radio emission in RQQs with larger $w_{\\rm 90}$ could not be attributed to outflow enhanced (positive feedback) star formation in the hosts. However, this also indicates the outflows, though exhibiting robust correlation with radio power, produce neither positive nor negative feedback to the star formation in their hosts.", "authors": "Mai Liao, Junxian Wang, Wenke Ren, Minhua Zhou", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

Now, high-throughput single-particle imaging (SPI) with x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) creates unprecedented opportunities for recovering the shape distributions of millions of particles that exhibit functionally relevant structural heterogeneity. To realize this potential, three challenges have to be overcome: (1) simultaneous parametrization of structural variability in real and reciprocal spaces; (2) efficiently inferring the latent parameters of each SPI measurement; (3) scaling up comparisons between $10^5$ structural models and $10^6$ XFEL-SPI measurements. Here, we describe how we overcame these three challenges to resolve the non-equilibrium shape distributions within millions of gold nanoparticles imaged at the European XFEL. These shape distributions allowed us to quantify the degree of asymmetry in these particles, discover a relatively stable `shape envelope' amongst nanoparticles, discern finite-size effects related to shape-controlling surfactants, and extrapolate nanoparticles' shapes to their idealized thermodynamic limit.

However, these behaviors cannot be explained by the conventional Edelstein effect and require a new mechanism. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of spin current generation under an external electric field due to chiral phonons in a chiral-structure superconductor based on the Bogoliubov de Gennes and the Boltzmann equations. In our mechanism, chiral phonons are induced by electric field due to inversion symmetry breaking and electron-phonon interaction. They work as an effective Zeeman field and hence spin-polarize Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the superconductor. As a result, the spin current carried by quasiparticles flows along the screw axis and shows a quadratic dependence on the electric field at the low-field range, leading to a nonreciprocal spin transport. The spin current also shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence and has a maximum at around the superconducting transition temperature.", "authors": "Dapeng Yao, Mamoru Matsuo, Takehito Yokoyama", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "The fate of the interstellar medium in early-type galaxies. III. The mechanism of ISM removal and quenching of star formation", "abstract": "Understanding how galaxies quench their star formation is crucial for studies of galaxy evolution. Quenching is related to the cold gas decrease. In the first paper we showed that the dust removal timescale in early-type galaxies (ETGs) is about 2.5 Gyr. Here we present carbon monoxide (CO) and 21 cm hydrogen (H I) line observations of these galaxies and measure the timescale of removal of the cold interstellar medium (ISM). We find that all the cold ISM components (dust, molecular and atomic gas) decline at similar rates. This allows us to rule out a wide range of potential ISM removal mechanisms (including starburst-driven outflows, astration, a decline in the number of asymptotic giant branch stars), and artificial effects like stellar mass-age correlation, environmental influence, mergers, and selection bias, leaving ionization by evolved low-mass stars and ionization/outflows by supernovae Type Ia or active galactic nuclei as viable mechanisms. We also provide evidence for an internal origin of the detected ISM. Moreover, we find that the quenching of star formation in these galaxies cannot be explained by a reduction in gas amount alone, because the star formation rates (SFRs) decrease faster (on a timescale of about 1.8 Gyr) than the amount of cold gas. Furthermore, the star formation efficiency of the ETGs (SFE = SFR/MH2) is lower than that of star-forming galaxies, whereas their gas mass fractions (fH2 = MH2/M*) are normal. This may be explained by the stabilization of gas against fragmentation, for example due to morphological quenching, turbulence, or magnetic fields.", "authors": "Michał J. Michałowski, C. Gall, J.

Compared to other sources in this sample, the GMCs from the Antennae, as well as in other starbursts and in the centers of galaxies, have the highest luminosities, surface densities, and turbulent pressures. The GMCs in starbursts and at the centers of galaxies also have large linewidths, although the linewidths in the Antennae are among the widest.

At the same time, the line width starts at 400-600 km/s but narrows down to 190 km/s at top end of the plume.

We aim to search for large molecules (>8 atoms) in the ALMA Band 3 spectrum of IRAS 16293-2422 B. We search for more than 70 molecules and identify as many lines as possible in the spectrum.

We identify lines of 31 molecules including many oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH3OH and c-C2H4O and a few nitrogen- and sulfur-bearing ones such as HOCH2CN and CH3SH. The largest detected molecules are gGg-(CH2OH)2 and CH3COCH3.

{"title": "Electron quantum optics in graphene", "abstract": "In the last decade, graphene has become an exciting platform for electron optical experiments, in many aspects superior to conventional two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). A major advantage, besides the ultra-large mobilities, is the fine control over the electrostatics, which gives the possibility of realising gap-less and compact p-n interfaces with high precision. The latter host non-trivial states, \\eg, snake states in moderate magnetic fields, and serve as building blocks of complex electron interferometers. Thanks to the Dirac spectrum and its non-trivial Berry phase, the internal (valley and sublattice) degrees of freedom, and the possibility to tailor the band structure using proximity effects, such interferometers open up a completely new playground based on novel device architectures. In this review, we introduce the theoretical background of graphene electron optics, fabrication methods used to realise electron-optical devices, and techniques for corresponding numerical simulations. Based on this, we give a comprehensive review of ballistic transport experiments and simple building blocks of electron optical devices both in single and bilayer graphene, highlighting the novel physics that is brought in compared to conventional 2DEGs. After describing the different magnetic field regimes in graphene p-n junctions and nanostructures, we conclude by discussing the state of the art in graphene-based Mach-Zender and Fabry-Perot interferometers.", "authors": "Himadri Chakraborti, Cosimo Gorini, Angelika Knothe, Ming-Hao Liu, Péter Makk, Francois D.

{"title": "Characterization of two fast-turnaround dry dilution refrigerators for scanning probe microscopy", "abstract": "Low-temperature scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) are critical for the study of quantum materials and quantum information science. Due to the rising costs of helium, cryogen-free cryostats have become increasingly desirable. However, they typically suffer from comparatively worse vibrations than cryogen-based systems, necessitating the understanding and mitigation of vibrations for SPM applications. Here we demonstrate the construction of two cryogen-free dilution refrigerator SPMs with minimal modifications to the factory default and we systematically characterize their vibrational performance. We measure the absolute vibrations at the microscope stage with geophones, and use both microwave impedance microscopy and a scanning single electron transistor to independently measure tip-sample vibrations. Additionally, we implement customized filtering and thermal anchoring schemes, and characterize the cooling power at the scanning stage and the tip electron temperature. This work serves as a reference to researchers interested in cryogen-free SPMs, as such characterization is not standardized in the literature or available from manufacturers.", "authors": "Mark E.

It also features a very comprehensive module for the computation of \"J\" and \"D\" factors that are relevant for indirect Dark Matter detection using gamma rays. Routines are coupled to parton-shower algorithms and Dark Matter halo mass functions from state-of-the-art kinematic fits. This code is also useful for testing generic hypotheses (not necessarily associated with any Dark Matter candidate) about the cosmic-ray electron/positron sources in the dwarf galaxies.

Extensive research has explored the long-term evolution of the properties of QPOs in BHBs. In contrast, such evolution in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has remained largely unexplored due to limited observational data. By using the 10 new XMM-Newton observations for the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396 from publicly available data, we analyze the characteristics of its X-ray QPOs and examine their long-term evolution. The hard-band (1--4 keV) QPOs are found in all 10 observations and the frequency of these QPOs evolves ranging at $(2.47\\text{--}2.83)\\times10^{-4}\\rm\\ Hz$. Furthermore, QPO signals in the soft (0.3--1 keV) and hard bands exhibit strong coherence, although, at times, the variations in the soft band lead those in the hard band (the hard-lag mode), while at other times, it is the reverse (the soft-lag mode). The observations presented here serendipitously captured two ongoing lag reversals within about two weeks, which are first seen in RE J1034+396 and also among all AGNs. A transition in QPO frequency also takes place within a two-week timeframe, two weeks prior to its corresponding lag reversal, indicating a possible coherence between the transitions of QPO frequency and lag mode with delay. The diagram of time lag versus QPO frequency clearly evidences this interconnected evolution with hysteresis, which is, for the first time, observed among AGNs.", "authors": "Ruisong Xia, Hao Liu, Yongquan Xue", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

At integer fillings of the topological flat bands, the strength of the displacement field and the superlattice potential tune phase transitions between quantum anomalous Hall insulator, trivial insulator, and metallic states.

The region above the lower temperature peak is found to be well described by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless model of thermal unbinding of vortex anti-vortex pairs while that below this peak fits well with the Ambegaokar- Halperin model of thermally-activated phase slip or vortex motion in Josephson junction arrays.

Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species with set chemical compositions. All galactic dust populations in our suite exhibit similar evolutionary histories, with gas-dust accretion being the dominant producer of dust mass for all but the most metal-poor galaxies. The onset of efficient gas-dust accretion occurs above a `critical' metallicity threshold ($Z_{\\rm crit}$). Due to this threshold, our simulations reproduce observed trends between galactic D/Z and metallicity and element depletion trends in the ISM. Furthermore, $Z_{\\rm crit}$ varies between dust species due to differences in key element abundances, dust physical properties, and life cycle processes resulting in $Z_{\\rm crit} \\sim 0.05 Z_{\\odot},\\,0.2 Z_{\\odot},\\,0.5 Z_{\\odot}$ for metallic iron, silicates, and carbonaceous dust, respectively. These variations could explain the lack of small carbonaceous grains observed in the Magellanic Clouds. We also find a delay between the onset of gas-dust accretion and when a dust population reaches equilibrium, which we call the equilibrium timescale ($\\tau_{\\rm eq}$). The relation between $\\tau_{\\rm eq}$ and the metal enrichment timescale of a galaxy, determined by its recent evolutionary history, can contribute to the scatter in the observed relation between galactic D/Z and metallicity.", "authors": "Caleb R.

Studies of this population, however, find a high incidence of far-infrared-luminous sources -suggesting significant dust-obscured star formation-but direct observations of the cold molecular gas fuelling this star formation are still necessary. We present a NOEMA study of CO(2-1) emission, tracing the cold molecular gas, in ten lensed z=1-1.5 unobscured QSOs. We detected CO(2-1) in seven of our targets, four of which also show continuum emission (\\lambda_rest = 1.3mm). After subtracting the foreground galaxy contribution to the photometry, spectral energy distribution fitting yielded stellar masses of 10^9-11 M_\\odot, with star formation rates of 25-160 M_\\odot yr^-1 for the host galaxies. These QSOs have lower $L'_\\mathrm{CO}$ than star-forming galaxies with the same L_IR, and show depletion times spanning a large range (50-900 Myr), but with a median of just 90 Myr. We find molecular gas masses in the range 2-40 x 10^9(alpha_CO/4) M_\\odot, which suggest gas fractions above ~50% for most of the targets. Despite the presence of an unobscured QSO, the host galaxies are able to retain significant amounts of cold gas. However, with a median depletion time of ~90 Myr, the intense burst of star formation taking place in these targets will quickly deplete their molecular gas reservoirs in the absence of gas replenishment, resulting in a quiescent host galaxy. The non-detected QSOs are three of the four radio-loud QSOs in the sample, and their properties indicate that they are likely already transitioning into quiescence. Recent cosmological simulations tend to overestimate the depletion times expected for these z~1 QSO-host galaxies, which is likely linked to their difficulty producing starbursts across the general high-redshift galaxy population.", "authors": "M.

We study how the deuterium fraction ($R_D$) changes with environment, compare deuteration of ions and neutrals, core centre and its envelope, and attempt to reproduce the observed results with a gas-grain chemical model. We chose high and low gas density tracers to study both core centre and the envelope.

On the contrary, investigation of the dust emissivity index indicated a generally constant value with redshift, suggesting shared dust properties among sources. We computed a mean cold dust SED considering all 10 QSOs that offers a comprehensive view of high-$z$ QSO's dust properties.

{"title": "Maser polarization through anisotropic pumping", "abstract": "(Abridged) Polarized emission from masers is an excellent tool to study magnetic fields in maser sources. The linear polarization of most masers is understood as an interplay of maser saturation and anisotropic pumping. However, for the latter mechanism, no quantitative modeling has been presented yet. We present a comprehensive model of maser polarization, including quantitative modeling of both anisotropic pumping and the effects of maser saturation on the polarization of masers. We extend regular maser excitation modeling with a dimension that describes the molecular population alignments, as well as including the linear polarization dimension to the radiative transfer. The results of the excitation analysis yield the anisotropic pumping and decay parameters, that are subsequently used in one-dimensional proper maser polarization radiative transfer modeling. We present the anisotropic pumping parameters for a variety of transitions from class I CH$_3$OH masers, H$_2$O masers and SiO masers. SiO masers are highly anisotropically pumped due to them occurring in the vicinity of a late-type star, that irradiates the maser region with a strong directional radiation field. Class I CH$_3$OH masers and H$_2$O masers occur in association with shocks, and they are modestly anisotropically pumped due to the anisotropy of the excitation region. Our modeling constitutes the first quantitative constraints on the anisotropic pumping of masers. We find that anisotropic pumping can explain the high polarization yields of SiO masers, as well as the modest polarization of unsaturated class I CH$_3$OH masers. We predict that the $183$ GHz H$_2$O maser is strongly anisotropically pumped.

We investigate the effect of dust attenuation on the UVJ diagram and find that it affects both the star-forming and the quiescent galaxy populations. The quiescent galaxy region is polluted by younger and star-forming highly inclined galaxies, while dust attenuation induces a separation in inclination of the star-forming galaxy population, with low-inclination galaxies remaining at the blue side of the diagram and high-inclination galaxies systematically moving towards the red side.

Quantitative characterization of SOTs highly relies on the SOT-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR), where a modulated microwave current is used to generate ac SOTs and the modulation-frequency is usually less than 100 kHz (the limit of conventional lock-in amplifiers). Here we have investigated the SOT of typical SOT material/ferromagnet bilayers in an extended modulation-frequency range, up to MHz, by developing the ST-FMR measurement. Remarkably, we found that the measured SOTs are enhanced about three times in the MHz range, which cannot be explained according to present SOT theory. We attribute the enhancement of SOT to additional magnon excitations due to phonon-magnon coupling, which is also reflected in the slight changes of resonant field and linewidth in the acquired ST-FMR spectra, corresponding to the modifications of effective magnetization and damping constant, respectively. Our results indicate that the write current of SOT-MRAM may be reduced with the assistant of phonon-magnon coupling.", "authors": "Hanying Zhang, Qianwen Zhao, Baiqing Jiang, Yuan Wang, Tunan Xie, Kaihua Lou, ChaoChao Xia, C.

We confirm our previous conclusion that there are three quite different regimes of CR transport in multiphase ISM gas, while also finding that simulations with \"live MHD\" predict a smoother CR pressure distribution. The CR pressure near the midplane is comparable to other pressure components in the gas, but the scale height of CRs is far larger. Next, with a goal of understanding the role of CRs in driving galactic outflows, we conduct a set of controlled simulations of the extraplanar region above $z=500$ pc, with imposed boundary conditions flowing from the midplane into this region. We explore a range of thermal and kinematic properties for the injected thermal gas, encompassing both hot, fast-moving outflows, and cooler, slower-moving outflows. The boundary conditions for CR energy density and flux are scaled from the supernova rate in the underlying TIGRESS model. Our simulations reveal that CRs efficiently accelerate extra-planar material if the latter is mostly warm/warm-hot gas, in which CRs stream at the Alfvén speed and the effective sound speed increases as density decreases. In contrast, CRs have very little effect on fast, hot outflows where the Alfvén speed is small, even when the injected CR momentum flux exceeds the injected MHD momentum flux.", "authors": "Lucia Armillotta, Eve C.

{"title": "Differences in the properties of disrupted and surviving satellites of Milky-Way-mass galaxies in relation to their host accretion histories", "abstract": "From the chemo-dynamical properties of tidal debris in the Milky Way, it has been inferred that the dwarf satellites that have been disrupted had different chemical abundances from their present-day counterparts of similar mass that survive today, specifically, they had lower [Fe/H] and higher [Mg/Fe]. Here we use the ARTEMIS simulations to study the relation between the chemical abundances of disrupted progenitors of MW-mass galaxies and their stellar mass, and the evolution of the stellar mass - metallicity relations (MZR) of this population with redshift. We find that these relations have significant scatter, which correlates with the accretion redshifts ($z_{\\rm acc}$) of satellites, and with their cold gas fractions. We investigate the MZRs of dwarf populations accreted at different redshifts and find that they have similar slopes, and also similar with the slope of the MZR of the surviving population ($\\approx 0.32$). However, the entire population of disrupted dwarfs displays a steeper MZR, with a slope of $\\approx 0.48$, which can be explained by the changes in the mass spectrum of accreted dwarf galaxies with redshift. We find strong relations between the (mass-weighted) $\\langle z_{\\rm acc} \\rangle$ of the disrupted populations and their global chemical abundances ($\\langle$[Fe/H]$\\rangle$ and $\\langle$[Mg/Fe]$\\rangle$), which suggests that chemical diagnostics of disrupted dwarfs can be used to infer the types of merger histories of their hosts. For the case of the MW, our simulations predict that the bulk of the disrupted population was accreted at $\\langle z_{\\rm acc} \\rangle \\approx 2$, in agreement with other findings. We also find that disrupted satellites form and evolve in denser environments, closer to their hosts, than their present-day counterparts.", "authors": "Salvador E. Grimozzi, Andreea S.

{"title": "The infalling elliptical galaxy M89: The chemical composition of the AGN disturbed hot atmosphere", "abstract": "The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot atmospheres has hitherto been primarily studied in galaxy clusters. These studies revealed relative abundances of heavy elements that are remarkably similar to Solar. Here, we present measurements of the metal content of M89 (NGC 4552), an elliptical galaxy infalling into the Virgo cluster with a $\\sim$10 kpc ram-pressure stripped X-ray tail. We take advantage of deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, and with particular attention to carefully modelling the spectra, we measure the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Si/Fe and S/Fe ratios. Contrary to previous measurements in galaxy clusters, our results for the hot atmosphere of M89 suggest super-Solar abundance ratios with respect to iron (i.e. $\\alpha$/Fe > 1), similar to its stellar components. Our analysis of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in this system indicates that the AGN-induced outflow could have facilitated the stripping of the original galactic atmosphere, which has been replaced with fresh stellar mass loss material with super-Solar $\\alpha$/Fe abundance ratios. Additionally, we report a new fitting bias in the RGS data of low-temperature plasma. The measured O/Fe ratios are >1$\\sigma$ lower in multi-temperature models than a single temperature fit, leading to discrepancies in the calculations of supernova fractions derived from the metal abundances.", "authors": "Sinancan Kara, Tomáš Plšek, Klaudia Protušová, Jean-Paul Breuer, Norbert Werner, François Mernier, E.

{"title": "On an apparent dearth of recurrent nova super-remnants in the Local Group", "abstract": "The Andromeda Galaxy is home to the annually erupting recurrent nova (RN) M31N 2008-12a (12a); the first nova found to host a nova super-remnant (NSR). A NSR is an immense structure surrounding a RN, created from many millions of eruptions sweeping up material in the local environment to form a shell tens of parsecs across. Theory has demonstrated that NSRs should be found around all RNe, even those systems with long periods between eruptions. Befittingly, the second NSR was found around the Galactic classical (and long suspected recurrent) nova, KT Eridani. In this Paper, we aim to find more of these phenomena through conducting the first ever survey for NSRs in M31 and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the surroundings of fourteen RNe in M31 as well as the surroundings of the four RNe in the LMC do not show any evidence of vast parsec-scale structures in narrowband (H${\\alpha}$ and [S II]) images, unlike the one clearly seen around 12a, and therefore conclude that observable NSRs are either rare structures, or they are too faint (or small) to be detected in our existing datasets. Yet, the NSR surrounding 12a would also likely to have been overlooked in our study if it were approximately one magnitude fainter. Searches for NSRs around other RNe 'masquerading' as classical novae may prove to be fruitful as would whole surveys of other Local Group galaxies.", "authors": "M. W. Healy-Kalesh, M. J. Darnley, M.

Some BBH sources are too faint to be individually detected, but collectively they may give rise to a stochastic GW background (SGWB). In this paper, we calculate the SGWB associated with BBH mergers dynamically assembled in dense star clusters, using state-of-the-art numerical models. We discuss the role of modeling the evolution of the mass distribution of BBH mergers, which has significant implications for model selection and parameter estimation, and could be used to distinguish between different channels of BBH formation. We demonstrate how the birth properties of star clusters affect the amplitude and frequency spectrum of the SGWB, and show that upcoming observation runs of ground-based GW detectors may be sensitive enough to detect it. Even in the case of a non-detection, we find that GW data can be used to constrain the highly uncertain cluster birth properties, which can complement direct observations of young massive clusters and proto-star clusters in the early universe by JWST.", "authors": "Xiao-Xiao Kou, Giacomo Fragione, Vuk Mandic", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Millikelvin confocal microscope with free-space access and high-frequency electrical control", "abstract": "Cryogenic confocal microscopy is a powerful method for studying solid state quantum devices such as single photon sources and optically controlled qubits. While the vast majority of such studies have been conducted at temperatures of a few Kelvin, experiments involving fragile quantum effects often require lower operating temperatures. To also allow for electrical dynamic control, microwave connectivity is required. For polarization-sensitive studies, free space optical access is advantageous compared to fiber coupling. Here we present a confocal microscope in a dilution refrigerator providing all the above features at temperatures below 100 mK. The installed high frequency cabling meets the requirements for state of the art spin qubit experiments. As another unique advantage of our system, the sample fitting inside a large puck can be exchanged while keeping the cryostat cold with minimal realignment. Assessing the performance of the instrument, we demonstrate confocal imaging, sub-nanosecond modulation of the emission wavelength of a suitable sample and an electron temperature of 76 mK. While the instrument was constructed primarily with the development of optical interfaces to electrically controlled qubits in mind, it can be used for many experiments involving quantum transport, solid state quantum optics and microwave-optical transducers.", "authors": "Thomas Descamps, Feng Liu, Tobias Hangleiter, Sebastian Kindel, Beata E.

To investigate this, we modelled the evolution of 29 star forming clumps that were extracted from our previous simulations that investigated the formation and early evolution of low-mass star clusters. These clumps were evolved using a three-dimensional smoothed particle radiation magnetohydrodynamics code, where we included or excluded non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics to match the cluster simulation. While star formation proceeded as expected, we were unable to identically reproduce any of the systems present at the end of the cluster simulations. However, the final distributions of stellar mass, stellar system mass, disc mass, and disc radii were reproduced statistically; unfortunately, the distribution of average magnetic field strengths in the discs was not reproduced statistically, but this may be a result of our updated algorithms governing the evolution of the magnetic field. Therefore, given that our clumps yield stellar masses that are statistically similar to those in the original low-mass star clusters, we have demonstrated that we can statistically reproduce systems (aside from their magnetic field strength) by evolving a subset of SPH particles. Therefore, clumps such as these can be used as initial conditions to investigate the formation of isolated stars from less-contrived initial environments.", "authors": "James Wurster, Connar Rowan", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

The interaction between them as well as exciton coupling to light may lead to strong optical nonlinearity, with applications in sensing and quantum information processing. Here, we achieve strong effective photon-photon interactions (Kerr-like optical nonlinearity) via the Rydberg blockade phenomenon and the hybridisation of excitons and photons forming polaritons in a Cu$_2$O-filled microresonators. Under pulsed resonant excitation polariton resonance frequencies are renormalised due to the reduction of the photon-exciton coupling with increasing exciton density. Theoretical analysis shows that the Rydberg blockade plays a major role in the experimentally observed scaling of the polariton nonlinearity coefficient as $\\propto n^{4.4 \\pm 1.8}$ for principal quantum numbers up to n = 7.

{"title": "Organic chemistry in the H2-bearing, CO-rich interstellar ice layer at temperatures relevant to dense cloud interiors", "abstract": "Ice chemistry in the dense, cold interstellar medium (ISM) is probably responsible for the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs). Recent laboratory experiments performed at T=4 K have shown that irradiation of CO:N2 ice samples analog to the CO-rich interstellar ice layer can contribute to the formation of COMs when H2 molecules are present. We have tested this organic chemistry under a broader range of conditions relevant to the interior of dense clouds by irradiating CO:15N2:H2 ice samples with 2 keV electrons in the 4-15 K temperature range. The H2 ice abundance depended on both, the ice formation temperature and the thermal evolution of the samples. Formation of H-bearing organics such as formaldehyde (H2CO), ketene (C2H2O), and isocyanic acid (H15NCO) was observed upon irradiation of ice samples formed at temperatures up to 10 K, and also in ices formed at 6 K and subsequently warmed up and irradiated at temperatures up to 15 K. These results suggest that a fraction of the H2 molecules in dense cloud interiors might be entrapped in the CO-rich layer of interstellar ice mantles, and that energetic processing of this layer could entail an additional contribution to the formation of COMs in the coldest regions of the ISM.", "authors": "Rafael Martín-Doménech, Alexander DelFranco, Karin I.

We find four new planets and seven planet candidates that were buried in the KMTNet archive. The new planets are OGLE-2016-BLG-1598Lb, OGLE-2016-BLG-1800Lb, MOA-2016-BLG-526Lb, and KMT-2016-BLG-2321Lb, which show typical properties of microlensing planets, i.e., giant planets orbit M dwarf host stars beyond their snow lines. For the planet candidates, we find planet/binary or 2L1S/1L2S degeneracies, which are an obstacle to firmly claiming planet detections. By combining the results of Shin et al.

Additionally, we utilize UVIT images to assess the star formation associated with these PAH emitting regions.

Based on the resolved scale study on the PAH bright regions using JWST and UVIT images, we found that the fraction of ionized PAH molecules is high in the star-forming regions with high {\\Sigma}SFR. We observed that emission from smaller PAH molecules is more in the star-forming regions with higher {\\Sigma}SFR. Our study suggests that the PAH molecules excited by the photons from SF regions with higher {\\Sigma}SFR are dominantly smaller and ionized molecules. UV photons from the star-forming regions could be the reason for a higher fraction of the ionized PAHs.

{"title": "Milky Way globular clusters on cosmological timescales. IV.

We statistically investigated the total interaction of globular clusters with the Solar System during six billion years of look-back time. We estimated the gravitational influence of globular clusters' flyby onto the Oort cloud system. To perform the realistic orbital dynamical evolution for each individual cluster, we used our own high-order parallel dynamical $N$ body $\\varphi$-GPU code that we developed. To reconstruct the orbital trajectories of clusters, we used five external dynamical time variable galactic potentials selected from the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological database and one static potential. To detect a cluster's close passages near the Solar System, we adopted a simple distance criterion of below 200 pc. To take into account a cluster's measurement errors (based on Gaia DR3), we generated 1000 initial positions and velocity randomizations for each cluster in each potential. We found 35 globular clusters that have had close passages near the Sun in all the six potentials during the whole lifetime of the Solar System.

{"title": "Probing coherence in metal absorption towards multiple images of strong gravitationally lensed quasars", "abstract": "We present a tomographic analysis of metal absorption lines arising from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at z~0.5-2, using Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of two background quasars at z~2.2 and 2.8, which are two of the few currently known quasars with multiple images due to strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters at z~0.6 and 0.5, respectively. The angular separations between different pairs of quasar multiple images enable us to probe the absorption over transverse physical separations of ~0.4-150 kpc, which are based on strong lensing models exploiting MUSE observations. The fractional difference in rest-frame equivalent width (Delta Wr) of MgII, FeII, CIV absorption increases on average with physical separation, indicating that the metal-enriched gaseous structures become less coherent with distance, with a likely coherence length scale of ~10 kpc. However, Delta Wr for all the ions vary considerably over ~0.08-0.9, indicating a clumpy CGM over the full range of length scales probed. At the same time, paired MgII absorption is detected across ~100-150 kpc at similar line-of-sight velocities, which could be probing cool gas clouds within the same halo. No significant dependence of Delta Wr is found on the equivalent width and redshift of the absorbing gas and on the galaxy environment associated with the absorption. The high-ionization gas phase traced by CIV shows a higher degree of coherence than the low-ionization gas phase traced by MgII, with ~90 percent of CIV systems exhibiting Delta Wr <=0.5 at separations <=10 kpc compared to ~50 percent of MgII systems.", "authors": "Rajeshwari Dutta, Ana Acebron, Michele Fumagalli, Claudio Grillo, Gabriel B.

Their stellar surface densities are around $10^5$~M$_{\\odot}$/pc$^2$, three orders of magnitude higher than typical star clusters in the local universe.

They would be the earliest known proto-globular clusters, formed less than 500 Myr after the Big Bang.

Our observations on 2005-11-26 elucidated a weak core, characterized by an inverted spectrum, and a distinctly bent jet that exhibited a notable bright feature in its Stokes I emission. Through comprehensive analysis of polarization and spectral data, we inferred the formation of a shock wave within this feature, stemming from interactions with a dense cloud in the ambient medium. In this paper, VLBI-Gaia astrometry further reinforces the core identification. With a deep analysis of six additional VLBA epochs spanning from 2007 to 2018, we observed that while the quasar's parsec-scale structure remained largely consistent, there were discernible flux density changes. These variations strongly imply the recurrent ejection of plasma into the jet. Complementing our VLBA data, RATAN-600 observations of the integrated spectra suggested an interaction between standing and travelling shock waves in 2005. Moreover, our multi-epoch polarization analysis revealed a drastic drop in rotation measure values from 6000 rad/m^2 to 1000 rad/m^2 within a single year, attributable to diminishing magnetic fields and particle density in an external cloud. This change is likely instigated by a shock in the cloud, triggered by the cloud's interaction with the jet, subsequently prompting its expansion. Notably, we also observed a significant change in the magnetic field direction of the jet, from being perpendicular post its observed bend to being perpendicular prior to the bend - an alteration possibly induced by the dynamics of shock waves.", "authors": "N.

{"title": "Cosmic evolution of black hole-spin and galaxy orientations: clues from the NewHorizon and Galactica simulations", "abstract": "(Reduced) Using the recent cosmological high-resolution zoom-in simulations, NewHorizon and Galactica, in which the evolution of black hole spin is followed on the fly, we have tracked the cosmic history of a hundred of black holes (BHs) with a mass greater than 2x10^4 Ms. For each of them, we have studied the variations of the three dimensional angle (Psi) subtended between the BH spins and the angular momentum vectors of their host galaxies. The analysis of the individual evolution of the most massive BHs suggests that they are generally passing by three different regimes. First, for a short period after their birth, low mass BHs (<3x10^4 Ms) are rapidly spun up by gas accretion and their spin tends to be aligned with their host galaxy spin. Then follows a second phase in which the accretion of gas onto low mass BHs (<10^5 Ms) is quite chaotic and inefficient, reflecting the complex and disturbed morphologies of forming proto-galaxies at high redshifts. The variations of Psi are rather erratic during this phase and are mainly driven by the rapid changes of the direction of the galaxy angular momentum. Then, in a third and long phase, BHs are generally well settled in the center of galaxies around which the gas accretion becomes much more coherent (>10^5 Ms). In this case, the BH spins tend to be well aligned with the angular momentum of their host galaxy and this configuration is generally stable even though BH merger episodes can temporally induce misalignment. We have also derived the distributions of cos(Psi) at different redshifts and found that BHs and galaxy spins are generally aligned. Finally, based on a Monte Carlo method, we also predict statistics for the 2-d projected spin-orbit angles lambda. In particular, the distribution of lambda traces well the alignment tendency in the 3-d analysis. Such predictions provide an interesting background for future observational analyses.", "authors": "Sebastien Peirani, Yasushi Suto, Ricarda S.

{"title": "Carbon envelopes around merging galaxies at z ~ 4.5", "abstract": "Galaxies evolve through a dynamic exchange of material with their immediate surrounding environment, the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Understanding the physics of gas flows and the nature of the CGM is thus fundamental to studying galaxy evolution, especially at $4 \\leq z \\leq 6$ when galaxies rapidly assembled their masses and reached their chemical maturity. Galactic outflows are predicted to enrich the CGM with metals, although gas stripping in systems undergoing a major merger has also been suggested to play a role. In this work, we explore the metal enrichment of the medium around merging galaxies at $z\\sim4.5$, observed by the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) survey. To do so, we study the nature of the [CII]158 $\\mu$m emission in the CGM around these systems, using simulations to help disentangle the mechanisms contributing to the CGM metal pollution. By adopting an updated classification of major merger systems in the ALPINE survey, we select and analyse merging galaxies whose components can be spatially and/or spectrally resolved in a robust way. In this way, we can distinguish between the [CII] emission coming from the single components of the system and that coming from the system as a whole. We also make use of the dustyGadget cosmological simulation to select synthetic analogues of observed galaxies and guide the interpretation of the observational results. We find a large diffuse [CII] envelope (> 20 kpc) embedding all the merging systems, with around 50% of the total [CII] emission coming from the medium between the galaxies. Using predictions from dustyGadget we suggest that this emission has a two-fold nature: it is due to both dynamical interactions between the galaxies which result in tidal stripped gas and the presence of star-forming satellites (currently unresolved by ALMA) that enrich the medium with heavy elements.", "authors": "C.

The high- and intermediate-velocity flows have well-collimated structures surrounded by the low-velocity flow. The chain of knots is embedded in the high-velocity flow or jet, which is the evidence of episodic mass ejections induced by time-variable mass accretion. We could detect the velocity gradients perpendicular to the outflow axis in both the low- and intermediate-velocity flows. We confirmed the rotation of the envelope and disk in the 13CO and C17O emission and found that their velocity gradients are the same as those of the outflow. Thus, we concluded that the velocity gradients in the low- and intermediate-velocity flows are due to the outflow rotation. Using observational outflow properties, we estimated the outflow launching radii to be 67.1 - 77.1 au for the low-velocity flow and 13.3 - 20.8 au for the intermediate-velocity flow. Although we could not detect the rotation in the jets due to the limited spatial resolution, we estimated the jet launching radii to be (2.36 - 3.14) x 10^-2 au using the observed velocity of each knots. Thus, the jet is driven from the inner disk region. We could identify the launching radii of distinct velocity components within a single outflow with all the prototypical characteristics expected from recent theoretical works.", "authors": "Mitsuki Omura, Kazuki Tokuda, Masahiro N.

These observations were collected simultaneously using the ROS2 and REMIR instruments at the Rapid Eye Mount telescope. The Cepheid sample covers a large range of distances (0.5 - 19.7 kpc) with varying precision of parallaxes, and thus astrometry-based luminosity fits were used to derive PL and PW relations in optical Sloan (griz) and near-infrared (JHKs) filters. These empirically calibrated relations exhibit large scatter primarily due to larger uncertainties in parallaxes of distant Cepheids, but their slopes agree well with those previously determined in the literature. Using homogeneous high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities of 61 Cepheids covering -1.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.6 dex, we quantified the metallicity dependence of PL and PW relations which varies between $-0.30\\pm0.11$ (in Ks) and $-0.55\\pm0.12$ (in z) mag/dex in grizJHKs bands. However, the metallicity dependence in the residuals of the PL and PW relations is predominantly seen for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -0.3 dex), which also have larger parallax uncertainties. The modest sample size precludes us from separating the contribution to the residuals due to parallax uncertainties, metallicity effects, and reddening errors. While this Cepheid sample is not optimal for calibrating the Leavitt law, upcoming photometric and spectroscopic datasets of the C-MetaLL survey will allow the accurate derivation of PL and PW relations in the Sloan and near-infrared bandpasses, which will be useful for the distance measurements in the era of the Vera C.

Such intranight variability in the rest-frame optical continuum has been carried out extensively, but there is a scarcity of such information in the rest-frame ultra-violet (UV), where the cause of variability might be due to {a} secondary population of relativistic particles. To fill this gap, recently in Chand et al. (2022) we reported for the first time intranight variability study of a sample of high-$z$ blazars so that the monitored optical radiation is their rest-frame UV radiation. Here we discuss in detail the implication of this investigation with a proper comparison of high-$z$ blazar samples with fractional optical polarization ($p_{opt}$) smaller and higher than 3\\%.

Our investigation does not reveal any compelling evidence for a stronger intranight variability of UV emission for high polarization blazars, in contrast to the blazars monitored in the rest-frame blue-optical.

{"title": "What Drives the Variability in AGN: Explaining the UV-Xray Disconnect Through Propagating Fluctuations", "abstract": "Intensive broadband reverberation mapping (IBRM) campaigns have shown that AGN variability is significantly more complex than expected from disc reverberation of the variable X-ray illumination. The UV/optical variability is highly correlated and lagged, with longer lag at longer wavelength, but the timescale is longer than expected. More challenging though is that the UV/optical lightcurves are not well correlated with the X-rays which were meant to be driving them. Instead, we consider an intrinsically variable accretion disc, where mass accretion rate fluctuations propagate in through the flow, modulating the intrinsically faster X-ray variability from the central regions. We match our model to the parameters of Fairall 9, a well studied AGN with $L\\sim 0.1L_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$, where the spectrum is dominated by the UV/EUV rather than the X-rays. We show that intrinsic variability and propagation gives X-ray and UV/optical light-curves that are dominated by variability on two different time-scales, yet are correlated on long time-scales. We include reprocessing of the X-rays from the disc but this has negligible impact on the lightcurves for spectra where the EUV dominates the bolometric power. We also include reverberation of the total (EUV plux X-ray) variable spectrum off a wind. This results in a bound-free component which predominantly follows the slow variable EUV, but lagged and smoothed on the light-travel time. This spectrum is redder than the EUV disc emission, so it contributes more at longer wavelengths giving the apparent rise in lag time with wavelength from a constant lag component. We conclude that contrary to the original motivation for IBRM campaigns, AGN variability is likely driven by intrinsic fluctuations within the disc, not X-ray reprocessing, and that the observed lags are produced by the EUV illumination of the wind not the X-ray illumination of the disc.", "authors": "Scott Hagen, Chris Done, Rick Edelson", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},

The energy output by the quasar, in the form of intense radiation and radio jets, is captured by the surrounding hot atmosphere. Here we present a new deep Chandra observation of H1821+643 and extract the hot gas properties into the region where Compton cooling by the quasar radiation is expected to dominate. Using detailed simulations to subtract the quasar light, we show that the soft-band surface brightness of the hot atmosphere increases rapidly by a factor of ~ 30 within the central ~ 10 kpc. The gas temperature drops precipitously to < 0.4 keV and the density increases by over an order of magnitude. The remarkably low metallicity here is likely due to photo-ionization by the quasar emission. The variations in temperature and density are consistent with hydrostatic compression of the hot atmosphere. The extended soft-band peak cannot be explained by an undersubtraction of the quasar or scattered quasar light and is instead due to thermal ISM. The radiative cooling time of the gas falls to only 12 +/- 1 Myr, below the free fall time, and we resolve the sonic radius. H1821+643 is therefore embedded in a cooling flow with a mass deposition rate of up to 3000 Msolar/yr. Multi-wavelength observations probing the star formation rate and cold gas mass are consistent with a cooling flow.

Rotation enhances the ultraviolet (UV) flux for up to $\\sim 400$ Myr after the starburst, with the slope of UV increasing as the population gets faster rotating and more metal-poor. Using the Prospector tool, we construct simulated galaxies and deduce their properties associated with dust and star formation. Our results suggest that rapid rotation models result in a gradual UV slope up to 0.1 dex higher and an approximately 50\\% increase in dust attenuation for identical wide-band spectral energy distributions. Furthermore, we investigate biases if the stellar population should be characterized by rapid rotation and demonstrate that accurate estimation can be achieved for rotation rates up to $\\omega_\\text{i}=0.6$. Accounting for the bias in the case of rapid rotation aligns specific star formation rates more closely with predictions from theoretical models. Notably, this also implies a slightly higher level of dust attenuation than previously anticipated, while still allowing for a `dust-free' interpretation of the galaxy. The impact of rapid rotation SPS models on the rest-UV luminosity function is found to be minimal. Overall, our findings have potentially important implications for comprehending dust attenuation and mass assembly history in the high-redshift Universe.", "authors": "Weijia Sun", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Accretion and Obscuration in Merger-Dominated Luminous Red Quasars", "abstract": "We present an analysis of the X-ray properties 10 luminous, dust-reddened quasars from the FIRST-2MASS (F2M) survey based on new and archival Chandra observations. These systems are interpreted to be young, transitional objects predicted by merger-driven models of quasar/galaxy co-evolution. The sources have been well-studied from the optical through mid-infrared, have Eddington ratios above 0.1, and possess high-resolution imaging, most of which shows disturbed morphologies indicative of a recent or ongoing merger. When combined with previous X-ray studies of five other F2M red quasars, we find that the sources, especially those hosted by mergers, have moderate to high column densities ($N_H \\simeq 10^{22.5-23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) and Eddington ratios high enough to enable radiation pressure to blow out the obscuring material. We confirm previous findings that red quasars have dust-to-gas ratios that are significantly lower than the value for the Milky Way's interstellar medium, especially when hosted by a merger. The dust-to-gas ratio for two red quasars that lack evidence for merging morphology is consistent with the Milky Way and they do not meet the radiative feedback conditions for blowout. These findings support the picture of quasar/galaxy co-evolution in which a merger results in feeding of and feedback from an AGN. We compare the F2M red quasars to other obscured and reddened quasar populations in the literature, finding that, although morphological information is lacking, nearly all such samples meet blowout conditions and exhibit outflow signatures suggestive of winds and feedback.", "authors": "Eilat Glikman, Stephanie LaMassa, Enrico Piconcelli, Luca Zappacosta, Mark Lacy", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

On the other hand, massive and compact Early Type Galaxies (cETGs) in the local Universe appear to show similar properties to Relic galaxies, despite having substantial accretion history. Relic galaxies, with frozen history, can provide important clues about the intrinsic processes related to the evolutionary pathways of ETGs and the role that mergers play in their evolution. Using the high-resolution cosmological simulation TNG50-1 from the Illustris Project, we investigate the assembly history of a sample of massive, compact, old, and quiescent subhalos split by satellite accretion fraction. We compare the evolutionary pathways at three cosmic epochs: $z = 2$, $z = 1.5$, and $z = 0$, using the orbital decomposition numerical method to investigate the stellar dynamics of each galactic kinematical component and their environmental correlations. Our results point to a steady pathway across time that is not strongly dependent on the environment. Relics and cETGs do not show a clear preference for high or low-density environments within the volume explored at TNG50. However, progenitors of Relic galaxies are shown to be located in high density since $z = 2$. The merger history can be recovered from the hot inner stellar halo imprints in the local Universe. In the current scenario, the mergers that drive the growth of cETGs do not give rise to a new and distinct evolutionary pathway when compared to Relics.

{"title": "Absence of radio-bright dominance in a near-infrared selected sample of red quasars", "abstract": "(Abridged). We explore the fraction of radio loud quasars in the eHAQ+GAIA23 sample, which contains quasars from the High A(V) Quasar (HAQ) Survey, the Extended High A(V) Quasar (eHAQ) Survey, and the Gaia quasar survey. All quasars in this sample have been found using a near-infrared color selection of target candidates that have otherwise been missed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We implemented a redshift-dependent color cut in g-i to select red quasars in the sample and divided them into redshift bins, while using a nearest-neighbors algorithm to control for luminosity and redshift differences between our red quasar sample and a selected blue sample from the SDSS. Within each bin, we cross-matched the quasars to the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) survey and determined the radio-detection fraction. We find similar radio-detection fractions for red and blue quasars within 1 sigma, independent of redshift. This disagrees with what has been found in the literature for red quasars in SDSS. It should be noted that the fraction of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars in red SDSS quasars is about five times lower than in our sample. BAL quasars have been observed to be more frequently radio quiet than other quasars, therefore the difference in BAL fractions could explain the difference in radio-detection fraction. The observed higher proportion of BAL quasars in our dataset relative to the SDSS sample, along with the higher rate of radio detections, indicates an association of the redness of quasars and the inherent BAL fraction within the overall quasar population. This finding highlights the need to explore the underlying factors contributing to both the redness and the frequency of BAL quasars, as they appear to be interconnected phenomena.", "authors": "S.

{"title": "Measuring the Virial Factor in SDSS DR5 Quasars with Redshifted H$β$ and Fe ii Broad Emission Lines", "abstract": "Under the hypothesis of gravitational redshift induced by the central supermassive black hole, and based on line widths and shifts of redward shifted H$\\beta$ and Fe ii broad emission lines for a sample of 1973 $z<0.8$ SDSS DR5 quasars, we measured the virial factor in determining supermassive black hole masses, usually estimated by the reverberation mapping (RM) method or the relevant secondary methods. The virial factor had been believed to be from the geometric effect of broad-line region. The measured virial factor of Fe ii is larger than that of H$\\beta$ for 98% of these quasars. The virial factor is very different from object to object and for different emission lines. For most of these quasars, the virial factor of H$\\beta$ is larger than these averages that were usually used in determining the masses of black holes. There are three positive correlations among the measured virial factor of H$\\beta$, dimensionless accretion rate and Fe ii/H$\\beta$ line ratio. A positive three-dimensional correlation is found among these three quantities, and this correlation indicates that the virial factor is likely dominated by the dimensionless accretion rate and metallicity. A negative correlation is found between the redward shift of H$\\beta$ and the scaled size of broad-line region radius in units of the gravitational radius of black hole. This negative correlation will be expected naturally if the redward shift of H$\\beta$ is mainly from the gravity of black hole. Radiation pressure from accretion disk may be a significant contributor to the virial factor.", "authors": "H. T. Liu, Hai-Cheng Feng, Sha-Sha Li, J. M. Bai", "date": " 18 Feb 2022"},

Merging clusters in the redshift interval $0.18<z<0.56$ have a distinctive peak in the ICL fractions measured between $\\sim 3800-4800$. In this work, we analyze two higher-redshift, clearly merging clusters, ACT-CLJ0102-49151 and CL J0152.7-1357, at $z>0.8$, using the HST optical and infrared images obtained by the RELICS survey. We report the presence of a similar peak in the ICL fractions, although wider and redshifted to the wavelength interval $\\sim 5200-7300$. The fact that this excess in the ICL fractions is found at longer wavelengths can be explained by an assorted mixture of stellar populations in the ICL, direct inheritance of an ICL that was mainly formed by major galaxy mergers with the BCG at $z>1$ and whose production is instantaneously burst by the merging event. The ubiquity of the ICL fraction merging signature across cosmic time enhances the ICL as a highly reliable and powerful probe to determine the dynamical stage of galaxy clusters, which is crucial for cluster-based cosmological inferences that require relaxation of the sample.", "authors": "Yolanda Jiménez-Teja, Renato A.

{"title": "Robustness of the Galactic Center Excess Morphology Against Masking", "abstract": "The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains an enduring mystery, with leading explanations being annihilating dark matter or an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars. Analyzing the morphology of the GCE provides critical clues to identify its exact origin. We investigate the robustness of the inferred GCE morphology against the effects of masking, an important step in the analysis where the gamma-ray emission from point sources and the galactic disk are excluded. Using different masks constructed from Fermi point source catalogs and a wavelet method, we find that the GCE morphology, particularly its ellipticity and cuspiness, is relatively independent of the choice of mask for energies above 2-3 GeV. The GCE morphology systematically favors an approximately spherical shape, as expected for dark matter annihilation. Compared to various stellar bulge profiles, a spherical dark matter annihilation profile better fits the data across different masks and galactic diffuse emission backgrounds, except for the stellar bulge profile from Coleman et al. (2020), which provides a similar fit to the data. Modeling the GCE with two components, one from dark matter annihilation and one tracing the Coleman Bulge, we find this two-component model outperforms any single component or combinations of dark matter annihilation and other stellar bulge profiles. Uncertainty remains about the exact fraction contributed by each component across different background models and masks. However, when the Coleman Bulge dominates, its corresponding spectrum lacks characteristics typically associated with millisecond pulsars, suggesting that it mostly models the emission from other sources instead of the GCE that is still present and spherically symmetric.", "authors": "Yi-Ming Zhong, Ilias Cholis", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Spectacular nucleosynthesis from early massive stars", "abstract": "Stars formed with initial mass over 50 Msun are very rare today, but they are thought to be more common in the early universe. The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early followup of SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early universe. J0931+0038 has relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.76 +/- 0.13) but an extreme odd-even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass > 50 Msun, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions.

{"title": "Formation of unipolar outflow and $\\textit{protostellar rocket effect}$ in magnetized turbulent molecular cloud cores", "abstract": "Observed protostellar outflows exhibit a variety of asymmetrical features, including remarkable unipolar outflows and bending outflows. Revealing the formation and early evolution of such asymmetrical protostellar outflows, especially the unipolar outflows, is essential for a better understanding of the star and planet formation because they can dramatically change the mass accretion and angular momentum transport to the protostars and protoplanetary disks. Here, we perform the three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation and early evolution of the asymmetrical protostellar outflows in magnetized turbulent isolated molecular cloud cores. We find, for the first time to our knowledge, that the unipolar outflow forms even in the single low-mass protostellar system. The results show that the unipolar outflow is driven in the weakly magnetized cloud cores with the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratios of $\\mu=8$ and $16$. Furthermore, we find the $\\textit{protostellar rocket effect}$ of the unipolar outflow, which is similar to the launch and propulsion of a rocket. The unipolar outflow ejects the protostellar system from the central dense region to the outer region of the parent cloud core, and the ram pressure caused by its ejection suppresses the driving of additional new outflows. In contrast, the bending bipolar outflow is driven in the moderately magnetized cloud core with $\\mu=4$. The ratio of the magnetic to turbulent energies of a parent cloud core may play a key role in the formation of asymmetrical protostellar outflows.", "authors": "Daisuke Takaishi, Yusuke Tsukamoto, Miyu Kido, Shigehisa Takakuwa, Yoshiaki Misugi, Yuki Kudoh, Yasushi Suto", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

Accurately determining this number and distribution of BH masses can provide crucial information about the processes involved in BH formation, the possibility of the existence of primordial BHs, and interpreting gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. Sahu et al. recently confirmed one isolated stellar-mass BH in our galaxy using astrometric microlensing. This work proposes a novel method to identify such BHs using the gravitational analog of the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) effect. We explicitly demonstrate the generation of GWs when a kilohertz(kHz) electromagnetic (EM) pulse from a pulsar is intervened by a spherically symmetric compact object situated between the pulsar and Earth. Specifically, we show that the curvature of spacetime acts as the catalyst, akin to the magnetic field in the GZ effect. Using the covariant semi-tetrad formalism, we quantify the GW generated from the EM pulse through the Regge-Wheeler tensor and express the amplitude of the generated GW in terms of the EM energy and flux. We demonstrate how GW detectors can detect stellar-mass BHs by considering known pulsars within our galaxy. This approach has a distinct advantage in detecting stellar mass BHs at larger distances since the GW amplitude falls as $1/r$.", "authors": "Susmita Jana, Rituparno Goswami, S.

While the enrichment mechanism is not fully understood, there is a correlation between a cluster's mass and the fraction of enriched stars found therein. However, present-day GC masses are often smaller than their masses at the time of formation due to dynamical mass loss. In this work, we explore the relationship between mass and MSPs using the stellar stream 300S. We present the chemical abundances of eight red giant branch member stars in 300S with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/MIKE. We identify one enriched star characteristic of MSPs and no detectable metallicity dispersion, confirming that the progenitor of 300S was a globular cluster.

However, theoretical studies of Ly$\\alpha$ emission are often limited by insufficient numerical resolution, incomplete sets of physical models, and poor line-of-sight (LOS) statistics. To overcome such limitations, we utilize here the novel PANDORA suite of high-resolution dwarf galaxy simulations that include a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art physical models for ionizing radiation, magnetic fields, supernova feedback and cosmic rays. We post-process the simulations with the radiative transfer code \\textsc{RASCAS} to generate synthetic observations and compare to observed properties of Ly$\\alpha$ emitters. Our simulated Ly$\\alpha$ haloes are more extended than the spatial region from which the intrinsic emission emanates and our spatially resolved maps of spectral parameters of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission are very sensitive to the underlying spatial distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen. Ly$\\alpha$ and LyC emission display strongly varying signatures along different LOS depending on how each LOS intersects low-density channels generated by stellar feedback. Comparing galaxies simulated with different physics, we find the Ly$\\alpha$ signatures to exhibit systematic offsets determined by the different levels of feedback strength and the clumpiness of the neutral gas. Despite this variance, and regardless of the different physics included in each model, we find universal correlations between Ly$\\alpha$ observables and LyC escape fraction, demonstrating a robust connection between Ly$\\alpha$ and LyC emission. Ly$\\alpha$ observations from a large sample of dwarf galaxies should thus give strong constraints on their stellar feedback-regulated LyC escape and confirm their important role for the reionization of the Universe.", "authors": "Yuxuan Yuan, Sergio Martin-Alvarez, Martin G.

We combined age and metallicity data of other nearby spiral galaxies ($\\lesssim18$~Mpc) obtained using similar methodology like the one we have used here to understand the origin of GCs in spiral galaxies in the cosmological context.

The virial factor had been believed to be independent of accretion radiation pressure on gas clouds in broad-line region (BLR), and only dependent on inclination effects of BLR. The virial factor measured spans a very large range. For the vast majority of AGNs ($>$96%) in our samples, the virial factor is larger than $f=1$ usually used in literatures. The $f$ correction makes the percent of high-accreting AGNs decrease by about 100 times. There are positive correlations of $f$ with the dimensionless accretion rate and Eddington ratio. The redward shifts of H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ are mainly the gravitational origin, confirmed by a negative correlation between the redward shift and the dimensionless radius of BLR. Our results show that radiation pressure force is a significant contributor to the measured virial factor, containing the inclination effects of BLR. The usually used values of $f$ should be corrected for high-accreting AGNs, especially high redshift quasars. The $f$ correction increases their masses by one--two orders of magnitude, which will make it more challenging to explain the formation and growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.", "authors": "H.

The H$_2$O R-branch in absorption unveils an IR-bright embedded compact source in D1 and the CO broad component features a highly turbulent environment. From both bands, we also identified extended intense star-forming (SF) activity associated with circumnuclear photodissociation regions (PDRs), consistent with the strong emission of the ionised 7.7 $\\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon band in this source.

We attempt to reproduce the universal IRX relation over $0.1\\leq z\\leq 2.5$ using the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations and examine sensitive parameters in determining galaxy dust attenuation. Our findings show that while the predicted universal IRX relation from EAGLE approximately aligns with observations at $z\\leq 0.5$, noticeable disparities arise at different stellar masses and higher redshifts. Specifically, we investigate how modifying various galaxy parameters can affect the predicted universal IRX relation in comparison to the observed data. We demonstrate that the simulated gas-phase metallicity is the critical quantity for the shape of the predicted universal IRX relation. We find that the influence of the infrared luminosity and infrared excess is less important while galaxy size has virtually no significant effect.

{"title": "First High-Resolution Spectroscopy of X-ray Absorption Lines in the Obscured State of NGC 5548", "abstract": "Multi-wavelength spectroscopy of NGC 5548 revealed remarkable changes due to presence of an obscuring wind from the accretion disk. This broadened our understanding of obscuration and outflows in AGN. Swift monitoring of NGC 5548 shows that over the last 10 years the obscuration has gradually declined. This provides a valuable opportunity for analyses that have not been feasible before because of too much obscuration. The lowered obscuration, together with the high energy spectral coverage of Chandra HETG, facilitate the first study of X-ray absorption lines in the obscured state. The comparison of the lines (Mg XI, Mg XII, Si XIII, and Si XIV) between the new and historical spectra reveals interesting changes, most notably the He-like absorption being significantly diminished in 2022. Our study finds that the changes are caused by an increase in both the ionization parameter and the column density of the warm-absorber outflow in the obscured state. This is contrary to the shielding scenario that is evident in the appearance of the UV lines, where the inner obscuring wind shields outflows that are located further out, thus lowering their ionization. The X-ray absorption lines in the HETG spectra appear to be unaffected by the obscuration. The results suggest that the shielding is complex since various components of the ionized outflow are impacted differently. We explore various possibilities for the variability behavior of the X-ray absorption lines and find that the orbital motion of a clumpy ionized outflow traversing our line of sight is the most likely explanation.", "authors": "Missagh Mehdipour, Gerard A.

{"title": "Low-mass stars: Their Protoplanetary Disc Lifetime Distribution", "abstract": "While most protoplanetary discs lose their gas within less than 10 Myr, individual disc lifetimes vary from < 1 Myr to >> 20 Myr, with some discs existing for > 40 Myr. Mean disc half lifetimes hide this diversity; only a so-far non-existing disc lifetime distribution could capture this fact. The benefit of a disc lifetime distribution would be twofold. First, it provides a stringent test on disc evolution theories. Second, it can function as input for planet formation models. Here, we derive such a disc lifetime distribution. We heuristically test different standard distribution forms for their ability to account for the observed disc fractions at certain ages. Here, we concentrate on the distribution for low-mass stars (spectral type M3.7 - M6, $M_s \\approx $ 0.1 - 0.24 M$_{sun}$) because disc lifetimes depend on stellar mass. A Weibull-type distribution ($k$=1.78, $\\lambda$=9.15) describes the observational data if all stars have a disc at a cluster age $t_c$=0. However, a better match exists for lower initial disc fractions. For f(t=0)= 0.65, a Weibull distribution (k=2.34, $\\lambda$=11.22) and a Gauss distribution ($\\sigma$=9.52, $\\mu$=9.52) fit similarly well the data.

{"title": "A physical picture for the acoustic resonant drag instability", "abstract": "Mixtures of gas and dust are pervasive in the universe, from AGN and molecular clouds to proto-planetary discs. When the two species drift relative to each other, a large class of instabilities can arise, called resonant drag instabilities (RDIs). The most famous RDI is the streaming instability, which plays an important role in planet formation. On the other hand, acoustic RDIs, the simplest kind, feature in the winds of cool stars, AGN, or starburst regions. Unfortunately, owing to the complicated dynamics of two coupled fluids (gas and dust), the underlying physics of most RDIs is mysterious. In this paper, we develop a clear physical picture of how the acoustic RDI arises and support this explanation with transparent mathematics. We find that the acoustic RDI is built on two coupled mechanisms. In the first, the converging flows of a sound wave concentrate dust. In the second, a drifting dust clump excites sound waves. These processes feed into each other at resonance, thereby closing an unstable feedback loop. This physical picture helps decide where and when RDIs are most likely to happen, and what can suppress them. Additionally, we find that the acoustic RDI remains strong far from resonance. This second result suggests that one can simulate RDIs without having to fine-tune the dimensions of the numerical domain.", "authors": "Nathan Magnan, Tobias Heinemann, Henrik N.

{"title": "Protostellar disk accretion in turbulent filaments", "abstract": "Recent observations of protostellar cores suggest that most of the material in the protostellar phase is accreted along streamers. Streamers in this context are defined as velocity coherent funnels of denser material potentially connecting the large scale environment to the small scales of the forming accretion disk. Using simulations which simultaneously resolve the driving of turbulence on the filament scale as well as the collapse of the core down to protostellar disk scales, we aim to understand the effect of the turbulent velocity field on the formation of overdensities in the accretion flow. We perform a three-dimensional numerical study on a core collapse within a turbulent filament using the RAMSES code and analyse the properties of overdensities in the accretion flow. We find that overdensities are formed naturally by the initial turbulent velocity field inherited from the filament and subsequent gravitational collimation. This leads to streams which are not really filamentary but show a sheet-like morphology. Moreover, they have the same radial infall velocities as the low density material. As a main consequence of the turbulent initial condition, the mass accretion onto the disk does not follow the predictions for solid body rotation. Instead, most of the mass is funneled by the overdensities to intermediate disk radii.", "authors": "Stefan Heigl, Elena Hoemann, Andreas Burkert", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

Through experiments involving the interaction of a chiral metal swastika structure with a SAM-OAM beam generated by a q-plate, we have observed a phenomenon does not present in pure SAM beams. Fourier back focal plane (FBP) imaging under SAM beam excitation easily identifies the chirality and geometric properties of the structure. When the SAM-OAM beam excites the structure, FBP not only identifies its chirality and geometric properties but also distinguishes different OAM topological charges and signs, as well as the degree of elliptic polarization. The stokes parametric FBP imaging reveals asymmetric polarization distribution resulting from the interaction between a vortex beam and the chiral structure.

Activity profiles within $1.5\\,R_{\\mathrm e}$ are examined in tandem with the mass, age, ellipticity and kinematics of the stars, as well as environmental density. Among the results of this comparison, we find that the sign of the radial activity gradient of S0s is tightly related to their PCA classification, BPT designation, and star formation status. PCA-passive lenticulars often show low-level, flat activity profiles, although there is also a significant number of systems with positive gradients, while their less common active counterparts generally have negative gradients, usually associated with high SSFRs and, sometimes, moderate Seyfert emission. A fraction of the latter also shows radial activity profiles with positive gradients, which become more abundant with increasing stellar mass regardless of environmental density. Our analysis also reveals that the subset of active S0s with negative gradients experiences at all galactocentric radii a systematic reduction in its median activity level with stellar mass, consistent with expectations for main sequence galaxies. In contrast, passive S0s with positive gradients show the opposite behaviour. Furthermore, systems whose activity is dominated by star formation are structurally rounder than the rest of S0s, while those classified as Seyfert exhibit higher rotational support. The possibility that negative and positive activity gradients in S0s may result from rejuvenation by two distinct types of minor mergers is raised.", "authors": "J. L. Tous, J. M. Solanes, J. D.

While our imaging reaches approximately two magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch at the Leo I distance of 11 Mpc, we find no evidence for an old red giant sequence that would signal an extended star formation history for the object. Instead, we clearly detect the red and blue helium burning sequences of its stellar populations, as well as the fainter blue main sequence, all indicative of a recent burst of star formation having taken place over the past 50--250 Myr. Comparing to isochrones for young metal-poor stellar populations, we infer this post-starburst population to be moderately metal poor, with metallicity [M/H] in the range -1 to -1.5. The combination of a young, moderately metal-poor post starburst population and no old stars motivates a scenario in which BST1047 was recently formed during a weak burst of star formation in gas that was tidally stripped from the outskirts of the neighboring massive spiral M96. BST1047's extremely diffuse nature, lack of ongoing star formation, and disturbed HI morphology all argue that it is a transitory object, a \"failing tidal dwarf\" in the process of being disrupted by interactions within the Leo I group.

A coherent large-scale field constitutes up to a few microgauss of the total, while the rest is built from strong magnetic fluctuations over a wide range of spatial scales. This represents sufficient magnetic energy for it to be dynamically significant. Several questions immediately arise: What is the physical mechanism that gives rise to such magnetic fields? How do these magnetic fields affect the formation and evolution of galaxies? In which physical processes do magnetic fields play a role, and how can that role be characterized? Numerical modelling of magnetized flows in galaxies is playing an ever-increasing role in finding those answers. We review major techniques used for these models. Current results strongly support the conclusion that field growth occurs during the formation of the first galaxies on timescales shorter than their accretion timescales due to small-scale turbulent dynamos. The saturated small-scale dynamo maintains field strengths at a few percent of equipartition with turbulence. The subsequent action of large-scale dynamos in differentially rotating discs produces observed modern field strengths in equipartition with the turbulence and having power at large scales. The field structure resulting appears consistent with observations including Faraday rotation and polarisation from synchrotron and dust thermal emission.

We performed cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations for three distinct halos of $\\sim10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ at $z\\geq13$ by varying the Jeans resolution from $32-256$ cells and employed Lyman Werner background flux of strengths $10^2-10^5$ in units of $J_{21}$, where $J_{21}=10^{-21}$ erg$/$cm$^2/$sr$/$s$/$Hz. To follow the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas we made use of the KROME package. In addition to the compression by collapse, we find magnetic field amplification via the dynamo both in the regimes of atomic and molecular hydrogen cooling. Moreover, we find a lower saturation level in the molecular hydrogen cooling regime. This behaviour can be understood due to the generally reduced radial infall velocities and vorticities in this regime, as well as the higher Mach numbers of the gas, which give rise to a smaller saturation ratio. Our results overall suggest that the dynamo operates over a large range of conditions in the collapsing gas.", "authors": "V.B. Díaz, D.R.G. Schleicher, M.A. Latif, P. Grete, R.

The dipole equilibrium configurations depend significantly on the geometrical parameters of the Möbius strip, as well as on the lattice dimensions. As a result of the variable dipole spacing on the curved surface of the Möbius strip, the ground state can consist of multiple domains with different dipole orientations which are separated by domain walls. We analyze in particular the dependence of the ground state dipole configuration on the width of the Möbius strip and highlight two crossovers in the ground state that can be correspondingly tuned. A first crossover changes the dipole lattice from a phase which resists compression to a phase that favors it. The second crossover leads to an exchange of the topological properties of the two involved domains. We conclude with a brief summary and an outlook on more complex topologically intricate surfaces.", "authors": "Ansgar Siemens, Felipe Augusto Oliveira Silveira, Peter Schmelcher", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Outflows Driven from a Magnetic Pseudodisk", "abstract": "Outflows play a pivotal role in star formation as one of its most visible markers and a means of transporting mass, momentum, and angular momentum from the infalling gas into the surrounding molecular cloud. Their wide reach (at least $\\sim 1000$s of au) is a contrast to typical disk sizes ($\\sim 10-100$ au). We employ high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study outflow properties in the Class 0 phase. We find that no disk wind is driven from the extended centrifugal disk that has weak magnetic coupling. The low-velocity winds emerge instead from the infalling magnetic pseudodisk. Much of the disk actually experiences an infall of matter rather than outflowing gas. Some of the pseudodisk wind (PD-wind) moves inward to regions above the disk and either falls onto the disk or proceeds upward. The upward flow gives the impression of a disk wind above a certain height even if the gas is originally emerging from the pseudodisk. The PD-wind has the strongest flow coming from a disk interaction zone that lies just outside the disk and is an interface between the inwardly advected magnetic field of the pseudodisk and the outwardly diffusing magnetic field of the disk. The low-velocity wind exhibits the features of a flow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force in some regions and those of a magnetocentrifugal wind in other regions. We interpret the structure and dynamics of the outflow zone in terms of the basic physics of gravity, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and nonideal MHD.", "authors": "Shantanu Basu, Mahmoud Sharkawi, Masahiro N.

This Letter presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-$z$ Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-$z$ star formation quenching. SMBHs globally impact their high-$z$ galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at $z > 4$. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar's output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio $M_\\bullet/M_\\star$ controls the average star formation efficiency: if $M_\\bullet/M_\\star > 8\\times 10^{18} (n \\Lambda/f_{edd})[(\\Omega_b M_h)/(\\Omega_m M_\\star) - 1]$, then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system towards the local $M_\\bullet - M_\\star$ relation. Furthermore, the $M_\\bullet - M_\\star$ relation evolves with redshift as $\\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. At $z \\sim 5$, we find an overmassive factor of $\\sim 55$, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-$z$ relation inferred from those.

Key to topological classification schemes are the three ``internal\" symmetries, time reversal ${\\cal T}$, charge conjugation ${\\cal C}$, and their product, called chiral symmetry ${\\cal S}={\\cal T}{\\cal C}$. In this work, we show that robust topological nodal line semimetal phases occur in $d=3$ in systems whose internal symmetries include ${\\cal S}$, without invoking crystalline symmetries other than translations. Since the nodal loop semimetal naturally appears as an intermediate gapless phase between the topological and the trivial insulators, a sufficient condition for the nodal loop phase to exist is that the symmetry class must have a nontrivial topological insulator in $d=3$. Our classification uses the winding number on a loop that links the nodal line. A nonzero winding number on a nodal loop implies robust gapless drumhead states on the surface Brillouin zone. We demonstrate how our classification works in all the nontrivial chiral classes and how it differs from the previous understanding of topologically protected nodal line semimetals.", "authors": "Faruk Abdulla, Ganpathy Murthy, Ankur Das", "date": " 30 Nov 2023"},

In this paper, we present an X-ray study of 50 ERQs to investigate the link between the X-ray and outflow properties of these intriguing objects. Using hardness ratio analysis, we confirm that the ERQs are heavily obscured systems with gas column density reaching $N_\\mathrm{H}=10^{23-24}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$.

We consider such X-ray weakness to be due to both gas absorption and intrinsic factors. Moreover, we find that the X-ray-weak sources also display higher-velocity outflows. One option to explain this trend is that weaker X-rays facilitate more vigorous line-driven winds, which then accelerate the [OIII]-emitting gas to kpc-scales. Alternatively, super-Eddington accretion could also lead to intrinsic X-ray weakness and more powerful continuum-driven outflow.", "authors": "Yilun Ma, Andy Goulding, Jenny E. Greene, Nadia L.

To understand effects of bursty star formation on [C II] LIM, which remain unexplored in previous studies, we present an analytic modeling framework for high-$z$ galaxy formation and [C II] LIM signals that accounts for bursty star formation histories induced by delayed supernova feedback. We use it to explore and characterize how bursty star formation can impact and thus complicate the interpretation of the [C II] luminosity function and power spectrum. Our simple analytic model indicates that bursty star formation is most important for low halo masses, and in the power spectrum it can create a substantial excess in the large-scale clustering term. This distortion results in a power spectrum shape which cannot be explained by invoking a mass-independent scatter.

In this work, we present an expansion of the anomalous Hall tensor into symmetrically invariant objects, encoding the magnetic configuration up to arbitrary power of spin. We show that these symmetric invariants can be utilized in conjunction with advanced regularization techniques in order to build models for the electric transport in magnetic textures which are, on one hand, complete with respect to the point group symmetry of the underlying lattice, and on the other hand, depend on a minimal number of order parameters only. Here, using a four-band tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the developed method can be used to address the importance and properties of higher-order contributions to transverse transport.

The effective radius is probably the most widely used indicator of galaxy size. We used the TNG50-SKIRT Atlas to investigate the wavelength dependence of the effective radius of galaxies at optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. We find that, on average, the effective radius in every band exceeds the stellar mass effective radius, and that this excess systematically decreases with increasing wavelength. The optical g-band (NIR Ks-band) effective radius is on average 58% (13%) larger than the stellar mass effective radius. Effective radii measured from dust-obscured images are systematically larger than those measured from dust-free images, although the effect is limited (8.7% in the g-band, 2.1% in the Ks-band). We find that stellar population gradients are the dominant factor (about 80%) in driving the wavelength dependence of the effective radius, and that differential dust attenuation is a secondary factor (20%). Comparing our results to recent observational data, we find offsets in the absolute values of the median effective radii, up to 50% for the population of blue galaxies. We find better agreement in the slope of the wavelength dependence of the effective radius, with red galaxies having a slightly steeper slope than green-blue galaxies. Comparing our effective radii with those of galaxies from the Siena Galaxy Atlas in separate bins in z-band absolute magnitude and g-z colour, we find excellent agreement for the reddest galaxies, but again significant offsets for the blue populations: up to 70% for galaxies around Mz=-21.5.

We find that parsec-scale clump mass is the most important factor driving the evolution; more massive clumps are able to concentrate more mass into their most massive cores - with a log-normally distributed efficiency of around 9% - in addition to containing the most dynamic gas. Distributions of linewidths within the most massive cores are similar to the ambient gas, suggesting that they are not dynamically decoupled, but are similarly chaotic.

Detailed Gaussian modeling of optical emission line profiles in high-dispersion spectra consistently shows that both bright recombination and collisionally excited lines can be fitted as one or two narrow components with intrinsic velocity dispersion of $\\sigma \\sim$40-100 km s$^{-1}$, on top of a broader component with $\\sigma \\sim$100-300 km s$^{-1}$, which contributes up to $\\sim$40% of the total flux and is preferentially blue-shifted from the systemic velocity. We interpret the narrow emission as highly ionized gas close to the young massive star clusters and the broader emission as a signpost of unresolved ionized outflows, resulting from stellar winds and supernova feedback. We find a significant correlation between the width of the broad emission and the LyC escape fraction, with strong LCEs exhibiting more complex and broader line profiles than galaxies with weaker or undetected LyC emission. Our findings provide new observational evidence supporting predictions from models and simulations, which suggest that gas turbulence and outflows resulting from strong radiative and mechanical feedback play a key role in clearing channels through which LyC photons escape from galaxies. We propose that the detection of blue-shifted broad emission in the nebular lines of compact extreme emission-line galaxies can provide a new indirect diagnostic of Lyman photon escape, which could be useful to identify potential LyC leakers in the epoch of reionization with the JWST.", "authors": "R.

Thus, we showcase for the first time explicit coexistence of 1D and 2D topology in a model existing in 1D physical space. We detail the superspace description by showcasing how our model can be mapped to a Harper-Hofstadter model, familiar from the description of the integer quantum Hall effect, and analyze the vanishing field limit analytically. An extension of the method used for vanishing fields is provided in order to handle any finite fields, corresponding to hopping modulations both commensurate and incommensurate with the lattice. In addition, this formalism allows us to obtain certain features of the 2D superspace model, such as its number of massless Dirac nodes, purely in terms of topological quantities, computed without the need to go into momentum space.", "authors": "Tiago Antão, Daniel Miranda, Nuno Peres", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Circumventing the polariton bottleneck via dark excitons in 2D semiconductors", "abstract": "Efficient scattering into the exciton polariton ground state is a key prerequisite for generating Bose-Einstein condensates and low-threshold polariton lasing. However, this can be challenging to achieve at low densities due to the polariton bottleneck effect that impedes phonon-driven scattering into low-momentum polariton states. The rich exciton landscape of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provides potential intervalley scattering pathways via dark excitons to rapidly populate these polaritons. Here, we present a microscopic study exploring the time- and momentum-resolved relaxation of exciton polaritons supported by a \\ce{MoSe2} monolayer integrated within a Fabry-Perot cavity. By exploiting phonon-assisted transitions between momentum-dark excitons and the lower polariton branch, we demonstrate that it is possible to circumvent the bottleneck region and efficiently populate the polariton ground state. Furthermore, this intervalley pathway is predicted to give rise to, yet unobserved, angle-resolved phonon sidebands in low-temperature photoluminescence spectra that are associated with momentum-dark excitons. This represents a distinctive experimental signature for efficient phonon-mediated polariton-dark-exciton interactions.", "authors": "Jamie M.

For electron spin qubits, fast readout stands out as a major obstacle in the pursuit of error correction. In this work, we explore the dispersive measurement of an individual spin in a semiconductor double quantum dot coupled to a nonlinear microwave resonator. By utilizing displaced squeezed vacuum states, we achieve rapid and high-fidelity readout for semiconductor spin qubits. Our findings reveal that introducing modest squeezing and mild nonlinearity can significantly improve both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the fidelity of qubit-state readout.

Within this context, gate-tunable phototransistors based on plasmonic resonances are often regarded as the most promising devices for frequency-selective detection of THz fields. The exploitation of constructive interference of plasma waves in such detectors not only promises frequency selectivity, but also a pronounced sensitivity enhancement at the target frequencies.

In this work, we demonstrate the sought-after room-temperature resonant detection of THz radiation in short-channel gated photodetectors made from high-quality single-layer graphene. The survival of this intriguing resonant regime at room-temperature ultimately relies on the weak intrinsic electron-phonon scattering in graphene, which avoids the damping of the plasma oscillations.", "authors": "José M.

Here we focus on the cosmic evolution, physical properties and AGN-host galaxy connections of radio-AGNs selected from a sample of ~ 500,000 galaxies at 0 < z < 4 in GOODS-N, GOODS-S, and COSMOS fields. Combining deep radio data with multi-band, de-blended far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimeter data, we identify 1162 radio-AGNs through radio excess relative to the FIR-radio relation. We study the cosmic evolution of 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and radio-AGNs, which are well described by a pure luminosity evolution of $L_*\\propto (1+z)^{-0.31z+3.41}$ and a pure density evolution of $\\Phi_*\\propto (1+z)^{-0.80z+2.88}$, respectively. We derive the turnover luminosity above which the number density of radio-AGNs surpasses that of SFGs. This crossover luminosity increases as increasing redshift, from $10^{22.9}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at z ~ 0 to $10^{25.2}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at z ~ 4. At full redshift range (0 < z < 4), we further derive the probability ($p_{radio}$) of SFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs) hosting a radio-AGN as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$), radio luminosity ($L_R$), and redshift (z), which yields $p_{radio}\\propto (1+z)^{3.54}M_*^{1.02}L_R^{-0.90}$ for SFGs, and $p_{radio}\\propto (1+z)^{2.38}M_*^{1.39}L_R^{-0.60}$ for QGs, respectively. It indicates that radio-AGNs in QGs prefer to reside in more massive galaxies with larger $L_R$ than those in SFGs, and radio-AGN fraction increases towards higher redshift in both SFGs and QGs with a more rapid increase in SFGs. Further, we find that the radio-AGN fraction depends on accretion states of BHs and redshift in SFGs, while in QGs it also depends on BH (or galaxy) mass.", "authors": "Yijun Wang, Tao Wang, Daizhong Liu, Mark T.

Investigating the abundance of $^{13}$CO across G214.5, we find that there is a significantly lower abundance along the entire 13 pc spine of the filament, extending out to a radius of $\\sim 0.8$ pc, corresponding to $A_v \\gtrsim 2$ mag and $T_{dust} \\lesssim 13.5$ K.

We show that Fuji localisations in hybrids of width $N$ and $N+2$ armchair nanoribbons occur around symmetric junctions if and only if $N\\pmod3=1$, while edge-aligned junctions never support strong localisation. This behaviour cannot be explained relying purely on the topological $Z_2$ invariant, which has been believed the origin of the localisations to date.", "authors": "Johann Ostmeyer, Lado Razmadze, Evan Berkowitz, Thomas Luu, Ulf-G.

Here we show that the spin transport through these magnonic chiral edge states can be electrically manipulated by non-Hermitian control. We consider the paradigmatic magnon Haldane model and show that it is transformed into an effective non-Hermitian magnon Chern insulator by including a sublattice-dependent spin-orbit torque. In linear spin-wave theory, this electrically induced torque causes a lasing of the chiral edge magnons along certain edge directions, leading to an enhancement of the spin-wave amplitude. This prediction is confirmed by numerical simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. For a spin-wave transport setup, in which magnons are excited by a microwave field and detected with a normal metal conductor, we find that the magnon amplification is remarkably robust against disorder, establishing non-Hermitian control as a promising avenue for topological magnonics.", "authors": "Pieter M.

To evaluate the gate error, we used the Magnus expansion introducing generalized filter functions that describe decoupling while processing and allow us to derive an approximate analytic expression as a hierarchy of nested integrals of noise cumulants. The error is separated in contributions of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, the corresponding generalized filter functions being calculated up to the fourth order. By exploiting the properties of selected pulse sequences, we show that it is possible to extract the second-order statistics (spectrum and cross-spectrum) and to highlight non-Gaussian features contained in the fourth-order cumulant.

We start by showing that the symmetry requirements for altermagnetism in 2D are somewhat more strict compared to bulk materials and applying these yields a total of 7 altermagnets in the C2DB. The collinear ground state in these monolayers are verified by spin spiral calculations using the generalized Bloch theorem. We focus on four $d$-wave altermagnetic materials belonging to the $P2_1'/c'$ magnetic space group - RuF$_4$, VF$_4$, AgF$_2$ and OsF$_4$. The first three of these are known experimentally as van der Waals bonded bulk materials and are likely to be exfoliable from their bulk parent compounds. We perform a detailed analysis of the electronic structure and non-relativistic spin splitting in $k$-space exemplified by RuF$_4$. The magnon spectrum of RuF$_4$ is calculated from the magnetic force theorem and it is shown that the symmetries that enforce degenerate magnon bands in anti-ferromagnets are absent in altermagnets and give rise to the obtained non-degenerate magnon spectrum. We then include spin-orbit effects and show that these will dominate the splitting ofmagnons in RuF$_4$.

The upper critical dimension for this transition is $d_c=5$, in contrast to the well-known $d_c=4$ of equilibrium phase separation.

In order to separate phononic and electronic contributions in the measured longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity, the electronic contributions are estimated from corresponding electrical resisivity and Hall effect measurements on the same samples by using the Wiedemann-Franz law. As may be expected for charge-compensated topological insulators the longitudinal thermal conductivity is phonon-dominated in all samples. However, we also find a pronounced field-linear thermal Hall effect that becomes most pronounced in the low-temperature range, where all samples are good electrical insulators. This indicates an underlying phononic mechanism of the thermal Hall effect and in this respect the topological insulators resemble other, mainly ionic, insulators, which have been reported to show a phonon-induced thermal Hall effect, but its underlying phononic mechanism remains to be identified.

{"title": "From ergodicity to Stark many-body localization in spin chains with single-ion anisotropy", "abstract": "The principles of ergodicity and thermalization constitute the foundation of statistical mechanics, positing that a many-body system progressively loses its local information as it evolves. Nevertheless, these principles can be disrupted when thermalization dynamics lead to the conservation of local information, as observed in the phenomenon known as many-body localization. Quantum spin chains provide a fundamental platform for exploring the dynamics of closed interacting quantum many-body systems. This study explores the dynamics of a spin chain with $S\\geq 1/2$ within the Majumdar-Ghosh model, incorporating a non-uniform magnetic field and single-ion anisotropy. Through the use of exact numerical diagonalization, we unveil that a nearly constant-gradient magnetic field suppress thermalization, a phenomenon termed Stark many-body localization (SMBL), previously observed in $S=1/2$ chains. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the sole presence of single-ion anisotropy is sufficient to prevent thermalization in the system. Interestingly, when the magnitudes of the magnetic field and anisotropy are comparable, they compete, favoring delocalization. Despite the potential hindrance of SMBL by single-ion anisotropy in this scenario, it introduces an alternative mechanism for localization. Our interpretation, considering local energetic constraints and resonances between degenerate eigenstates, not only provides insights into SMBL but also opens avenues for future experimental investigations into the enriched phenomenology of disordered free localized $S\\geq 1/2$ systems.", "authors": "M.

We address the performance of DFT based paramagnetic calculations by utilizing the spin space averaging relaxation approach. Our results show that both magnetic and elastic contributions have significant influence towards segregation and embrittling behaviour of Zn. The primary requirement is the elastic contribution, while the presence of magnetic disorder increases the critical concentrations for the onset of GB weakening. While Zn segregation is more favourable in bcc compared to fcc GB, larger impact of Zn coverage on GB weakening is observed for fcc. For both structures, the rapid decrease in surface defect state energies is identified as the driving force behind GB weakening. These surface defect states stabilize at lower Zn concentrations than GB defect states.", "authors": "Ujjal Saikia, Mira Todorova, Tilmann Hickel", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

In this report, the recent advances, including intrinsic mechanisms, direct and indirect experimental observations of OHE, are reviewed comprehensively. The orbital current, generated by OHE, shows much more fundamental features than spin current in explaining Hall conductivity and manipulating magnetization electronically. Theoretically, in momentum space, the OHE is proposed to originate from electric-field driven non-equilibrium orbital texture, based on tight-binding model. However, current experimental works still stay on the level to reveal how the OHE behaves after orbital current is generated, and the unambiguous experimental evidence to verify the generation mechanism of OHE is still missing, limiting the interpretation of OHE. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with polarized incident photon, on the other hand, could be used to identify the orbital textures on energy band and reveal the non-equilibrium nature of orbital-momentum locking behind OHE, which may help to provide the direct experimental evidence to examine the intrinsic mechanism of OHE, and reveal the nature of wave packet with non-vanishing orbital angular momentum.", "authors": "Xin Li", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

Here we study a one-dimensional interacting system of spinless Fermions in the presence of a deterministic quasiperiodic potential using the Fock-space propagator. From the system-size scaling of the self-energy associated with the diagonal elements and the scaling of the off-diagonal elements of the propagator, we extract fractal characteristics and FS localization lengths, respectively, which behave similarly to that in the random system. We compute the sample-to-sample fluctuations of the typical self-energy and the off-diagonal propagator over different realizations of the potential and show that the fluctuations in the self-energy distinguish quasiperiodic and random systems, whereas the fluctuations of the off-diagonal elements cannot demarcate the two types of potential.", "authors": "Soumi Ghosh, Jagannath Sutradhar, Subroto Mukerjee, Sumilan Banerjee", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

We consider SrNbO$_3$ and n-type SrTiO$_3$ and contrast results for bulk and thin film (slab) geometries. By varying the electron doping in SrTiO$_3$ we get insight into how the electron-vacancy scattering vary for different experimental conditions. We observe a significant increase in the scattering cross-section (in units of square-lattice parameter, $a^2$) from ca. $0.5-2.5a^2$ per vacancy in SrNbO$_3$ and heavily doped SrTiO$_3$ to more than $9a^2$ in SrTiO$_3$ with 0.02 free carriers per unit cell. Furthermore, the scattering strength of O vacancies is enhanced in TiO$_2$ terminated surfaces by more than 6 times in lowly doped SrTiO$_3$ compared to other locations in slabs and bulk systems. Interestingly, we also find that Sr vacancies go from being negligible scattering centers in SrNbO$_3$ and heavily doped SrTiO$_3$, to having a large scattering cross-section in weakly doped SrTiO$_3$.

On the Nishimori line, we find the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern retrieval. Interestingly, we find that that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the teacher-student setting coincides with the paramagnetic to spin-glass transition of the direct model, i.e. with random patterns. Outside of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive tolerance to noise.

The impurity spectral function and the Kondo temperature were calculated for different set of parameters, including Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and an external magnetic field. Interestingly, in the RSOC and altermagnetic fields, the hybridization function is spin independent, despite the characteristic broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) of the altermagnet. This is because the alternating sign of the spin splitting of the bands in the momentum space renders equal contributions for both spin components of the hybridization function. Our results demonstrate that, although the hybridization function is TR symmetric, the Kondo temperature is substantially suppressed by the altermagnet coupling. Moreover, we have investigated the effect of an external magnetic field applied in the altermagnet along different directions. Interestingly, we observe an important restraining of the Kondo peak which depends strongly on the direction of the field.

{"title": "Information bath and learning processes along geodesics", "abstract": "Learning is a fundamental characteristic of living systems, enabling them to comprehend their environments and make informed decisions. These decision-making processes are inherently influenced by available information about their surroundings and specific objectives. An intriguing perspective is that each process could be optimal under a given set of conditions. Here, a geometric method is introduced for analytically exploring such a perspective. The probability distribution describing the state of the composite system of the environment, termed the information bath, and a decision-maker is discussed on the basis of the entropic concept. This enables one to study the system in analogy with thermodynamics. Learning processes are expressed as the changes of parameters contained in the distribution. For a geometric interpretation of the processes, the manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao metric as the Riemannian metric is considered. This framework allows one to conceptualize the optimality of each process as a state change along a geodesic curve on the manifold, which is referred to here as geodesic learning. Then, the bivariate Gaussian model is presented for illustrating this approach, and its rigorous solution is obtained. There, the correspondence between learning and cooling is made manifest. Evolution of the entropy is evaluated for geodesic learning. The findings are then interpreted in the context of adaptation.

Here we show experimentally that the canonical integer quantum Hall regime can provide a robust anyon platform. Exploiting the Coulomb interaction between two co-propagating quantum Hall channels, an electron injected into one channel splits into two fractional charges behaving as abelian anyons. Their unconventional statistics is revealed by negative cross-correlations between dilute quasiparticle beams. Similarly to fractional quantum Hall observations, we show that the negative signal stems from a time-domain braiding process, here involving the incident fractional quasiparticles and spontaneously generated electron-hole pairs.

{"title": "Peridynamic Neural Operators: A Data-Driven Nonlocal Constitutive Model for Complex Material Responses", "abstract": "Neural operators, which can act as implicit solution operators of hidden governing equations, have recently become popular tools for learning the responses of complex real-world physical systems. Nevertheless, most neural operator applications have thus far been data-driven and neglect the intrinsic preservation of fundamental physical laws in data. In this work, we introduce a novel integral neural operator architecture called the Peridynamic Neural Operator (PNO) that learns a nonlocal constitutive law from data. This neural operator provides a forward model in the form of state-based peridynamics, with objectivity and momentum balance laws automatically guaranteed. As applications, we demonstrate the expressivity and efficacy of our model in learning complex material behaviors from both synthetic and experimental data sets. We show that, owing to its ability to capture complex responses, our learned neural operator achieves improved accuracy and efficiency compared to baseline models that use predefined constitutive laws. Moreover, by preserving the essential physical laws within the neural network architecture, the PNO is robust in treating noisy data. The method shows generalizability to different domain configurations, external loadings, and discretizations.", "authors": "Siavash Jafarzadeh, Stewart Silling, Ning Liu, Zhongqiang Zhang, Yue Yu", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

In the SY chain of quantum dots, each described by infinite-range random Heisenberg model of $N$ spin-$S$ $SU(M)$ spins, we obtain the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_\\mathrm{L}$ and butterfly velocity $v_B$ as a function of temperature $T$ and the quantum parameter $S$ across the PM-SG phase boundary using a bosonic spinon representation in the large-$N,M$ limit. In particular, we extract asymptotic $T$ and $S$ dependence, e.g., power laws, for $\\lambda_\\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ in different regions deep inside the phases and near the replica symmetry breaking SG transition. We find the chaos to be non-maximal almost over the entire phase diagram. Very similar results for chaos indicators are found for the $p$-spin glass chain as a function of temperature and a suitable quantum parameter $\\Gamma$, with some important qualitative differences. In particular, $\\lambda_\\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ exhibit a maximum, coinciding with onset of complex glassy relaxation, above the glass transition as a function of $T$ and $\\Gamma$ in the PM phase of the $p$-spin glass model. In contrast, the maximum is only observed as a function of $S$, but not with temperature, in the PM phase of SY model. The maximum originates from enhanced chaos due to maximal complexity in the glassy landscape. Thus, the results in the SY model indicate very different evolution of glassy complexity with quantum and thermal fluctuations.", "authors": "Venkata Lokesh K.

To fulfill their function, such electrolytes must have an extraordinarily high ionic Li$^+$ conductivity. Layer-structured Li$_3$InCl$_6$ represents such a candidate; understanding the origin of the rapid Li$^+$ exchange processes needs, however, further investigation. Spatially restricted, that is, low-dimensional particle diffusion might offer an explanation for fast ion dynamics. It is, however, challenging to provide evidence for 2D diffusion at the atomic scale when dealing with polycrystalline powder samples. Here, we used purely diffusion-induced $^7$Li nuclear magnetic spin relaxation to detect anomalies that unambiguously show that 2D Li diffusion is chiefly responsible for the dynamic processes in a Li$_3$InCl$_6$ powder sample. The change of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ as a function of inverse temperature $1/T$ passes through a rate peak that is strictly following asymmetric behavior. This feature is in excellent agreement with the model of P. M. Richards suggesting a logarithmic spectral density function $J$ to fully describe 2D diffusion. Hence, Li$_3$InCl$_6$ belongs to the very rare examples for which 2D Li$^+$ diffusion has been immaculately verified. We believe that such information help understand the dynamic features of ternary Li halides.", "authors": "Florian Stainer, H. Martin R. Wilkening", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Transmission-eigenchannel velocity and diffusion", "abstract": "The diffusion model is used to calculate the time-averaged flow of particles in stochastic media and the propagation of waves averaged over ensembles of disordered static configurations. For classical waves exciting static disordered samples, such as a layer of paint or a tissue sample, the flux transmitted through the sample may be dramatically enhanced or suppressed relative to predictions of diffusion theory when the sample is excited by a waveform corresponding to a transmission eigenchannel. Even so, it is widely acknowledged that the velocity of waves is irretrievably randomized in scattering media. Here we demonstrate in microwave measurements and numerical simulations that the statistics of velocity of different transmission eigenchannels remain distinct on all length scales and are identical on the incident and output surfaces. The interplay between eigenchannel velocities and transmission eigenvalues determines the energy density within the medium, the diffusion coefficient, and the dynamics of propagation. the diffusion coefficient and all scatter9ng parameters, including the scattering mean free path, oscillate with width of the sample as the number and shape of the propagating channels in the medium change.", "authors": "Azriel Z.

However the synthesis of BaZrS$_3$ thin-films for characterisation and device integration remains a challenge. Here we use density functional theory and lattice dynamics to calculate the vibrational properties of elemental, binary and ternary materials in the Ba-Zr-S system. This is used to build a thermodynamic model for the stability of BaZrS$_3$, BaS$_x$, and ZrS$_x$ in equilibrium with sulfur gas, across a range of temperatures and sulfur partial pressures. We highlight that reaction thermodynamics are highly sensitive to sulfur allotrope and the extent of allotrope mixing. We use our model to predict the synthesis conditions in which BaZrS$_3$ and the intermediate compound BaS$_3$, which is associated with fast reaction kinetics, can form. At a moderate temperature of 500C we find that BaS$_3$ is stable at pressures above 3x10$^5$ Pa.

{"title": "Disorder scattering in classical flat channel transport of particles between twisted magnetic square patterns", "abstract": "We measure the trajectories of macroscopic magnetic particles pulled against gravity between twisted alternating magnetic square patterns in a superposed homogeneous magnetic field normal to both patterns. The two patterns are built from a set of magentic cubes having a distribution of magnetization. The magnetic potential between the patterns is a sum of three contributions: two being periodic on two lattices with different magnitude and orientation, and the third random contribution arising from the distribution of magnetization of the cubes. As one varies the twist angle between the two patterns each time the twist angle coincides with a magic twist angle one of the two periodic lattices becomes a sublattice of the other lattice. Simulations of particles moving through patterns with a precise cube magnetization produce pronounced mobility peaks near magic twist angles that are associated with flat channels. Weak random fluctuations of the cube magnetization in the experiment and the simulations cause enhanced random disorder of the potential and reduce the mobility by scattering particles into the interior of the twisted Wigner Seitz cells. The mobility undergoes an Anderson transition from magic to generic behavior as the magnetization disorder increases beyond half of a percent of the cube magnetization.", "authors": "Anna M. E. B.

While the self-assembly kinetics in these systems have been elucidated and related to the product characteristics, the weak interparticle bonding interactions suggest the superstructures formed could continue to order within the solution long after the primary nucleation and growth have occurred, even though the mechanism of annealing remains to be elucidated. Here, we use a combination of Bragg coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to create real-space maps of supercrystalline order along with a real-time view of the strain fluctuations in aging strongly coupled nanocrystal superlattices while they remain suspended and immobilized in solution. By combining the results, we deduce that the self-assembled superstructures are polycrystalline, initially comprising multiple nucleation sites, and that shear avalanches at grain boundaries continue to increase crystallinity long after growth has substantially slowed. This multimodal approach should be generalizable to characterize a breadth of materials in situ in their native chemical environments, thus extending the reach of high-resolution coherent X-ray characterization to the benefit of a much wider range of physical systems.", "authors": "Matthew J.

{"title": "Global Coronal Magnetic Field Estimation Using Bayesian Inference", "abstract": "Estimating the magnetic field strength in the solar corona is crucial for understanding different physical processes happening over diverse spatio-temporal scales. However, the high temperatures and low density of the solar corona make this task challenging. The coronal magnetic field is too weak to produce a measurable splitting of the spectral lines using the Zeeman effect, and high temperature causes spectral lines to become weak and broad, making it difficult to detect the small Zeeman splitting. Coronal magneto-seismology, which combines the theoretical and observed properties of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, can be used to infer the magnetic field strength of oscillating structures in the solar corona, which are otherwise difficult to estimate. In this work, we use the Doppler velocity and density data obtained from the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP) on 2016 October 14 to obtain the global map of the coronal magnetic field using Bayesian inference. Two priors are used for plasma density, viz Gaussian and uniform distributions. Bayesian inference provides us with the probability distribution for the magnetic field strength at each location from 1.05 to 1.35 $R_\\odot$. A comparison between the magnetic field obtained using simple inversion and Bayesian inference is also drawn. We find that the values obtained using simple inversion do not always match the maximum posterior estimates obtained using Bayesian inference.

{"title": "Improved modelling of SEP event onset within the WSA-Enlil-SEPMOD framework", "abstract": "Multi-spacecraft observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events not only enable a deeper understanding and development of particle acceleration and transport theories, but also provide important constraints for model validation efforts. However, because of computational limitations, a given physics-based SEP model is usually best-suited to capture a particular phase of an SEP event, rather than its whole development from onset through decay. For example, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere often incorporate solar transients only at the outer boundary of their so-called coronal domain -- usually set at a heliocentric distance of 20-30 $R_{\\odot}$. This means that particle acceleration at CME-driven shocks is also computed from this boundary onwards, leading to simulated SEP event onsets that can be many hours later than observed, since shock waves can form much lower in the solar corona. In this work, we aim to improve the modelled onset of SEP events by inserting a \"fixed source\" of particle injection at the outer boundary of the coronal domain of the coupled WSA-Enlil 3D MHD model of the heliosphere. The SEP model that we employ for this effort is SEPMOD, a physics-based test-particle code based on a field line tracer and adiabatic invariant conservation. We apply our initial tests and results of SEPMOD's fixed-source option to the 2021 October 9 SEP event, which was detected at five well-separated locations in the inner heliosphere -- Parker Solar Probe, STEREO-A, Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft.", "authors": "Erika Palmerio, Janet G.

Objects which have magnetic fields, spin, and accrete produce jets and collimated outflows. Jets are seen in systems ranging from brown dwarf stars to supermassive black holes. Outflow speeds are typically a few times the escape speed from the launch region - 100s of \\kms\\ for young stars to nearly the speed of light for black-holes. Because many young stellar objects (YSOs) are nearby, we can see outflow evolution and measure proper motions on times scales of years. Because the shocks in YSO outflows emit in atoms, ions, and molecules in addition to the continuum, many physical properties such as temperatures, densities, and velocities can be measured. Momenta and kinetic energies can be computed. YSO outflows are a major source of feedback in the self-regulation of star formation. The lessons learned can be applied to much more distant and energetic cosmic sources such as AGN and galactic nuclear super winds - systems in which evolution occurs on time-scales of hundreds to millions of years. Some dense star-forming regions produce powerful explosions. The nearest massive star-forming region, Orion OMC1, powered a $\\sim 10^{48}$ erg explosion about 550 years ago (that is when the light from the event would have reached the Solar System).

Although the expected number of events is small (compared to, for example, inelastic neutrino-nucleus charged current interaction with xenon nuclei, that also gives rise to final state electrons), the distinct spectral shape of the scattered electrons may allow identification of the elastic scattering events. Further, while the process is dominated by neutrinos and antineutrinos of electron flavor, it receives contributions from all the six neutrino species. Identification of the electron scattering events may, therefore, allow an estimation of the relative fractions of the total supernova explosion energy going into electron flavored and non-electron flavored neutrinos.", "authors": "Pijushpani Bhattacharjee, Kamales Kar", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

This lattice, a two-dimensional (2D) structure comprising squares, hexagons, and octagons, is representative of the biphenylene network (BPN). Our findings reveal an intriguing ground-state phase diagram, featuring an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating phase enveloped by three valence-bond solid-like (VBS-like) insulating phases. Analyzing the single-particle gap, spin gap, and single-particle spectral function, we observe that the metallic state in the noninteracting case becomes unstable under the influence of Hubbard U. This interaction drives the system into a hexagon insulating phase before transitioning into an AFM Mott insulating phase. To quantify the critical exponents, we use finite-size scaling techniques. The critical exponents of quantum critical points between the AFM Mott insulating phase and two insulating phases, plaquette insulator and ethylene insulator, closely align with the 3D O(3) universality class. However, the critical exponents of quantum critical points between the hexagon insulating phase and the AFM Mott insulating phase deviate from the 3D O(3) universality class. This deviation is a finite-size effect and can be attributed to the coupling between the fluctuations of magnetic order parameter and very low-energy fermionic excitations.

Such electron incoherence manifests itself most evidently in the non-Drude behavior of the optical response of the system and the anomalous density fluctuation behavior in the long wave length limit. The spectral weight transfer related to such dissipative response, which is absent in conventional Fermi liquid metal, has direct consequence on the dc transport property of the system in the normal state and the superfluid stiffness in the superconducting state. It is found that such electron incoherence remains significant even in the clean limit and at low temperature and thus must be attributed to the strong electron correlation effect in the cuprate superconductors. Here we study such an intrinsic effect in the 2D $t-J$ model through the variational calculation of its optical conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega)$. We assume a resonating valence bond ground state as our starting point and find that a significant portion of the total optical spectral weight remains incoherent throughout the phase diagram. The optical absorption is found to extend all the way to an energy of the order of the bare band width. We find that both the total optical weight $\\bar{K}$ and the integrated incoherent optical weight $I$ increase monotonically with doping, with their ratio $R_{incoh}=I/\\bar{K}$ decreasing monotonically with doping. Our results indicate that the majority part of electron incoherence in the 2D $t-J$ model can be attributed to the electron fractionalization mechanism assumed in such a treatment.

NMR spectra establish the absence of any dipolar order there, whereas the weak field dependence of the magnetization above $H_{c1}$ is accounted for by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction terms. The low-energy spin dynamics (fluctuations), measured by nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ($T_1^{-1}$), confirms the continuity of this phase and the absence of any low-temperature phase transition. Unexpectedly, the spin dynamics above $H_{c1}$ is largely dominated by two-magnon processes, which is expected above the saturation field of a spin-nematic phase, but not inside. This shows that BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$ is indeed close to a spin-nematic instability, however, this phase is not stabilized.

These theories have a well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories and $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows that in spacetime dimensions $d=2$ only the confined phase is generically possible. In $d=3,4$ the confined phase and a topological BF phase are both generic, while in $d=4$ a phase with a massless photon is also possible. We construct a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which, surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement -- proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but not sufficient condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and sufficient.", "authors": "Mendel Nguyen, Tin Sulejmanpasic, Mithat Ünsal", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

In contrast to the ferromagnetic metallic ground state obtained from density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$ gives three ferromagnetic solutions converging to integer moment values (1, 2 \\& 3 $\\mu_B$/f.u) over a range of $U$. Interestingly, two of the solutions are found to exhibit half-metallicity with correspondingly $S$=1/2 and S=3/2 spin states. The half-metallic ferromagnetic state with $S$=3/2 is found to be the ground state solution for SCO. Co atoms show a large deviation from the formal +4 oxidation state indicating the presence of strong covalency effects. Our results suggest a plausible metal to half-metal phase transition around $U$($J$)=4.4(1.16) eV. The Fermi surface study shows gradual collapse in states leading to half-metallicity suggesting \\textit{\\textbf{k}}-dependence of effective $U$ around the critical region. Surprisingly, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), unexpectedly large orbital moment ($L_{z}$=0.6) is noted in SCO putting it among the class of 3$d$ based transition metal compounds exhibiting pronounced orbital magnetization. The calculations give large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of $\\sim$48 meV.

It was observed in an earlier study \\cite{Our_circulation} that CC occurs near the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) in fermionic systems which have some form of asymmetry. We find general analytical expression to support this observation for quadratic fermionic networks. We then apply these ideas to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with periodic boundary conditions and a tight binding model with unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches. In both these cases, we find the specific conditions required for observing CC and study the behavior of these currents with various system parameters. We find that having an unequal number of fermionic sites in the upper and lower branches is enough for generating CC in the SSH model. However, this asymmetry is not adequate for the tight-binding model and we require unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches to induce CC in this model. Finally, we observe that for certain system parameters, the onset point of particle and heat CC are not the same. Based on all these observations, we describe how carefully examining the energy spectrum of the system gives a great deal of information about the possibility and behavior of CC in fermionic systems with asymmetries.", "authors": "Vipul Upadhyay, Rahul Marathe", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

State space truncation -- the restriction of the observations to a subset of state space with prescribed probability -- is introduced to obtain that result. Two stochastic processes undergoing first-order phase transitions are analyzed both analytically and numerically: the Ehrenfest urn model and the 2D Ising model subject to a magnetic field. In presence of phase transitions, we prove that even minimal state space truncation makes averages of exponentials of path dependent variables sensibly deviate from full state space values. Specifically, in the case of discontinuous phase transitions, this approach is strikingly effective in locating the critical transition value of the control parameter. As this approach works even with variables different from those of fluctuation theorems, it provides a new recipe to identify order parameters in the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions, profiting from the often incomplete statistics that are available.", "authors": "Matteo Colangeli, Antonio Di Francesco, Lamberto Rondoni", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Escape from textured adsorbing surfaces", "abstract": "The escape dynamics of sticky particles from textured surfaces is poorly understood despite importance to various scientific and technological domains. In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the escape time of adsorbates from prevalent surface topographies, including holes/pits, pillars, and grooves. Analytical expressions for the probability density function and the mean of the escape time are derived. A particularly interesting scenario is that of very deep and narrow confining spaces within the surface. In this case, the joint effect of the entrapment and stickiness prolongs the escape time, resulting in an effective desorption rate that is dramatically lower than that of the untextured surface. This rate is shown to abide a universal scaling law, which couples the equilibrium constants of adsorption with the relevant confining length scales. While our results are analytical and exact, we also present an approximation for deep and narrow cavities based on an effective description of one dimensional diffusion that is punctuated by motionless adsorption events. This simple and physically motivated approximation provides high-accuracy predictions within its range of validity and works relatively well even for cavities of intermediate depth.

In all these models, there exists a phase transition at which long range connectivity is established, if local connectedness increases through a threshold $p_c$. In ordinary (site or bond) percolation on regular lattices, this is a well understood second-order phase transition with rather precisely known critical exponents, but there are non-standard models where the transitions are in different universality classes (i.e. with different exponents and scaling functions), or even are discontinuous or hybrid. It was recently claimed that certain scaling functions are in all such models given by extreme-value theory and thus independent of the precise universality class. This would lead to super-universality (even encompassing first-order transitions!) and would be a major break-through in the theory of phase transitions.

{"title": "Nematic quantum disordered state in FeSe", "abstract": "The unusual quantum-disordered magnetic ground state intertwined with superconductivity and electronic nematicity in FeSe has been a research focus in iron-based superconductors. However, the intrinsic spin excitations across the entire Brillouin zone in detwinned FeSe, which forms the basis for a microscopic understanding of the magnetic state and superconductivity, remain to be determined. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to map out the spin excitations of FeSe dewtinned with a uniaxial-strain device. We find that the stripe spin excitations (Q=(1, 0)/(0, 1)) exhibit the $C_2$ symmetry up to $E\\approx120$ meV, while the N{é}el spin excitations (Q=(1, 1)) retain their $C_4$ symmetry in the nematic state. The temperature dependence of the difference in the spin excitations at Q=(1, 0) and (0, 1) for temperatures above the structural phase transition unambiguously shows the establishment of the nematic quantum disordered state. The similarity of the Néel excitations in FeSe and NaFeAs suggests that the Néel excitations are driven by the enhanced electron correlations in the $3d_{xy}$ orbital. By determining the key features of the stripe excitations and fitting their dispersions using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with biquadratic interaction ($J_1$-$K$-$J_2$), we establish a spin-interaction phase diagram and conclude that FeSe is close to a crossover region between the antiferroquadrupolar, Néel, and stripe ordering regimes.

Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases as a result of internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole thermalized by holographic matters. The reflected entropy between the bipartition of a large black hole exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time. In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in a global thermofield double state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting with an environment. The Rényi mutual information within the double-copied SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system and the external interaction with the baths.

In this work, we investigated the electrical transport and magnetic properties of CePd3S4 under pressure up through 12 GPa so as to better understand the interplay between electronic and magnetic phases in this material. Our findings show that the low pressure FM state is suddenly replaced by a new magnetically ordered phase that is most likely antiferromagnetic that spans from ~ 7 GPa to ~ 11 GPa. Whereas this could be described as an example of avoided quantum criticality, given that clear changes in resistance and Hall data are detected near 6.3 GPa for all temperatures below 300 K, it is also possible that the change in ground state is a response to a pressure induced change in structure. The lack of any discernible change in the pressure dependence of the room temperature unit cell parameter/volume across this whole pressure range suggests that this change in structure is either more subtle than could be detected by our measurements (i.e. development of weak, new wave vector) or the transition is electronic (such as a Lifshitz transition).", "authors": "S.

We then demonstrate that this inhibition can result from from geometric frustration of the bond lattice that disables quantum phase coherence of the order parameter residing on it. In comparison, upon deviating from the honeycomb lattice, relief of geometric frustration allows robust superfluidity with non-trivial spatial structure. For the specific examples of bilayer and trilayer graphene under an external electric field, such bond centered order parameter would develop superfluidity with staggered flux that breaks the time-reversal symmetry.

Combining an analytic representation of the initial state with a numerical description of the relevant excitations using the two-fermion approximation, we can construct the spectrum of post-quench excitations and their overlaps with the initial state, identifying the underlying mechanism. For confining quenches built upon the true vacuum, the propagating signal consists of Schr{ö}dinger cats of left and right-moving mesons escaping confinement.

This paper delves into gradient descent-based learning algorithms, that display a linear structure in their parameter dynamics, reminiscent of the neural tangent kernel. We establish this apparent linearity arises due to weak correlations between the first and higher-order derivatives of the hypothesis function, concerning the parameters, taken around their initial values. This insight suggests that these weak correlations could be the underlying reason for the observed linearization in such systems. As a case in point, we showcase this weak correlations structure within neural networks in the large width limit.

Kinetic methods for reducing the complexity of such systems typically involve the derivation of nonlinear partial differential equations for the corresponding global densities. In recent years there has been considerable interest in the mean field limit of interacting particle systems with long range interactions. Two major examples are interacting Brownian particles in the overdamped regime and the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators. In this paper we analyze these systems in the presence of local or global stochastic resetting, where the position or phase of each particle independently or simultaneously resets to its original value at a random sequence of times generated by a Poisson process. In each case we derive the Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation describing hydrodynamic fluctuations of the global density, and then use a mean field ansatz to obtain the corresponding nonlinear McKean-Vlasov (MV) equation in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show how the MV equation for global resetting is driven by a Poisson shot noise process, reflecting the fact that resetting is common to all of the particles and thus induces correlations that cannot be eliminated by taking a mean field limit. We then investigate the effects of local and global resetting on nonequilibrium stationary solutions of the macroscopic dynamics and, in the case of the Kuramoto model, the reduced dynamics on the Ott-Antonsen manifold.", "authors": "Paul C Bressloff", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Enhancement of Ising superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$ via surface fluorination", "abstract": "Recently discovered Ising superconductors have garnered considerable interest due to their anomalously large in-plane upper critical fields ($B_{c2}$). However, the requisite strong spin-orbital coupling in the Ising pairing mechanism generally renders these superconductors heavy-element dominant with notably low superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$). Here, based on the Migdal-Eliashberg theory and the mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of Ising superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$ through surface fluorination, as evidenced by concomitant improvements in $T_c$ and $B_{c2}$. This enhancement arises from three predominant factors. Firstly, fluorine atoms symmetrically and stably adhere to both sides of the monolayer NbSe$_2$, thereby maintaining the out-of-plane mirror symmetry and locking carrier spins out-of-plane. Secondly, fluorination suppresses the charge density wave in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and induces a van Hove singularity in the vicinity of the Fermi level, leading to a marked increase in the number of carriers and, consequently, strengthening the electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Lastly, the appearance of fluorine-related, low-frequency phonon modes further augments the EPC. Our findings suggest a promising avenue to elevate $T_c$ in two-dimensional Ising superconductors without compromising their Ising pairing.", "authors": "Jizheng Wu, Wujun Shi, Chong Wang, Wenhui Duan, Yong Xu, Chen Si", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},

We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely, a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid (NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS) phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method.

The question was whether Li addition characterized by a high Debye frequency would have any positive effects on Tc. The optimum citrate-gel and heat treatment conditions were identified as those yielding samples with a maximum grain size on the order of 50 micro.m (up to the optimum Li-doping level, x=0.01). Li substitution at the Y site was verified by structural, electrical, and magnetic measurements of the produced samples, whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the formation of a pure phase with no visible impurity phases. Moreover, AC magnetic susceptibility measurements showed no increase in the superconducting transition temperature Tc, consistent with the predicted results obtained by machine learning method, although it was theoretically expected to increase owing to the high Debye frequency of Li. This observation is consistent with magnetic coupling models for pairing mechanism in cuprates. Finally, because of the optimum conditions of the preparation procedure, nearly identical values of the critical current density (Jc) were recorded for samples with different Li doping levels (up to the optimum Li doping level). It was found that improved compound preparation conditions would have a critical and extensive effect on Jc enhancement, with nearly no Tc suppression.", "authors": "Mahshid Amiri Moghadam, Hassan Gashmard, Seyed Sajjad Hosseini, Hamideh Shakeripour, Hadi Salamati", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Thermal fluctuations (eventually) unfold nanoscale origami", "abstract": "There has been a resurgence of interest in using origami principles--along with $2$D materials--to design a wide array of nanoscale devices. In this work, we take cognizance of the fact that small-scale devices are vulnerable to entropic thermal fluctuations and thus a foundational question underlying small-scale origami pertains to its stability. To properly understand the behavior of these origami-based nanodevices, we must simultaneously consider the geometric mechanics of origami along with the interplay between thermal fluctuations, entropic repulsive forces, van der Waals attraction, and other molecular-scale phenomena. In this work, to elucidate the rich behavior underpinning the evolution of an origami device at the nanoscale, we develop a minimal statistical mechanics model of folded nanoscale sheets. We use the model to investigate (1) the thermodynamic multistability of nanoscale origami structures and (2) the rate at which thermal fluctuations drive its unfolding--that is, its temporal stability. We identify, for the first time, an entropic torque that is a critical driving force for the unfolding process. Both the thermodynamic multistability and temporal stability have a nontrivial dependence on the origami's bending stiffness, the radii of curvature of its creases, the ambient temperature, its thickness, and its interfacial energy (between folded layers). Specifically, for graphene, we show that there is a critical side length below which it can no longer be folded with stability; similarly, there exists a critical crease diameter, membrane thickness (e.g. for multilayer graphene), and temperature above which a crease cannot be stably folded. To investigate the rate of thermally driven unfolding, we extend Kramers' escape rate theory to cases where the minima of the energy well occurs at a boundary.", "authors": "Matthew Grasinger, Pradeep Sharma", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

Here, we revisit a particular example in the settings of an open quantum system. We consider a collection of non-interacting atoms coupled to a spatially correlated bosonic bath characterized by a bath correlation length. Our result implies that the integrability of the system depends on such a correlation length. If this length is much larger than the distance between the atoms, such a system behaves as a nearly integrable open quantum system. We study the properties of the emerging prethermal state for this case, i.e., the state's lifetime, the extensive numbers of existing quasi-conserved quantities, the emergence of the generalized Gibbs state, and the scaling of von Neumann entropy, etc. We find that for the prethermal state, the maximum growth of entropy is logarithmic with the number of atoms, whereas such growth is linear for the final steady state, which is the Gibbs state in this case.

However, in the visible wavelengths, it's intrinsic optical switching is quite low. Current research explores solutions like multilayering, intricate structural patterning, high thermal budget processes and costly metals for improved color switching.

This work overcomes these limitations and demonstrates dynamic multi-colour switching covering a large color gamut using a simple, unpatterned, ultrathin ($\\sim$ $\\frac{\\lambda}{14}$, where wavelength $\\lambda$ is taken as 575 nm at the center of visible spectrum) asymmetric Fabry-Pérot structure of $VO_{2}$ on Aluminium (Al).

We observe unexpected characteristics that challenge the conventional temperature-dependent behavior of heavy fermion systems, revealing unexpected characteristics. At temperatures above the anticipated coherence temperature (T$^*$), we observe itinerant U 5f electrons at temperatures higher than previously postulated. Additionally, a previously unidentified dispersionless band emerges around 600 meV below the Fermi energy, potentially linked to spin-orbit splitting within the U 5f states. Hybridization between the 5f electrons and conduction band was observed with an energy dispersion of 10 meV at low temperatures, suggesting that U 5f electrons near and at the Fermi surface have an itinerant nature. Temperature-dependent 5d-5f resonance spectra reveal that the 5f electron spectrum weight increases with lowering temperature and begins to decrease at temperatures significantly higher than the Neel temperature (T$_N$). We further show that the competition between the Kondo effect and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions may be responsible for the relocalization of 5f electrons, making relocalization a precursor to the establishment of magnetic order at lower temperatures. Our experiments also provide evidence that 5f electrons with the same orbital are involved in both the Kondo effect and RKKY interactions, suggesting that the two coexist at lower temperatures.", "authors": "Jiao-Jiao Song, Chen Zhang, Qi-Yi Wu, Yin-Zou Zhao, Jan Rusz, John.

We show that independently estimating thresholds for the $X_L$ (phase-flip), $Y_L$, and $Z_L$ (bit-flip) logical failure rates can give a more confident threshold estimate. Using this method for the XZZX model with a tensor-network based decoder we find that the thresholds converge with code distance to a single value at moderate bias ($\\eta=30, 100$), corresponding to an error rate above the hashing bound.

{"title": "Real-time Impurity Solver Using Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operators", "abstract": "An emergent and promising tensor-network-based impurity solver is to represent the path integral as a matrix product state, where the bath is analytically integrated out using Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Here we present an approach to calculate the equilibrium impurity spectral function based on the recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators method. The central idea is to perform a quench from a separable impurity-bath initial state as in the non-equilibrium scenario. The retarded Green's function $G(t+t_0, t'+t_0)$ is then calculated after an equilibration time $t_0$ such that the impurity and bath are approximately in thermal equilibrium. There are two major advantages of this method. First, since we focus on real-time dynamics, we do not need to perform the numerically ill-posed analytic continuation in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo case that relies on imaginary-time evolution. Second, the entanglement growth of the matrix product states in real-time calculations is observed to be much slower than that in imaginary-time calculations, leading to a significant improvement in numerical efficiency. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model and benchmarked against the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method.", "authors": "Ruofan Chen, Xiansong Xu, Chu Guo", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

While the Nb$^{3+}$ trimer with six 4d electrons forms spin-singlets in the sigma-bonding orbitals for three Nb-Nb bonds, a localized S=1/2 spin remains on the Nb$^{4+}$ ion. Furthermore, a local electric dipole moment is induced along the three-fold rotation axis of each distorted tetramer by the cluster rearrangement.

{"title": "The Kondo effect in the quantum $XX$ spin chain", "abstract": "We investigate the boundary phenomena that arise in a finite-size $XX$ spin chain interacting through an $XX$ interaction with a spin$-\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity located at its edge. Upon Jordan-Wigner transformation, the model is described by a quadratic Fermionic Hamiltonian. Our work displays, within this ostensibly simple model, the emergence of the Kondo effect, a quintessential hallmark of strongly correlated physics. We also show how the Kondo cloud shrinks and turns into a single particle bound state as the impurity coupling increases beyond a critical value. Using both \\textit{Bethe Ansatz} and \\textit{exact diagonalization} techniques, we show that the local moment of the impurity is screened by different mechanisms depending on the ratio of the boundary and bulk coupling. When the ratio falls below the critical value $\\sqrt{2}$, the impurity is screened via the multiparticle Kondo effect. However, when the ratio between the coupling exceeds the critical value , a bound mode is formed at the impurity site which screens the spin of the impurity. We show that the boundary phase transition is reflected in local ground state properties by calculating the spinon density of states, the magnetization at the impurity site in the presence of a global magnetic field, and the finite temperature susceptibility. We find that the spinon density of states in the Kondo phase has the characteristic Lorentzian peak that moves from the Fermi level to the maximum energy of the spinon as the impurity coupling is increased and becomes a localized bound mode in the bound mode phase. Moreover, the impurity magnetization and the finite temperature impurity susceptibility behave differently in the two phases.

Recently their common nature was supposed due to similar doping dependence of their critical temperatures. In the CDW phase, a large frozen deformation of strongly ionic lattice is observed. Like for a single carrier in a highly polarizable lattice, for multiple carriers in it the choice between delocalized states of all the carriers and autolocalized states of some part of them is determined by minimum of free energy of interacting carrier and phonon fields. Applying variational approach, we calculate free energy of a two-liquid system of carriers with cuprates-like dispersion comprising liquid of autolocalized carriers (large polarons and bipolarons) and Fermi liquid of delocalized carriers. Comparing it with the free energy of pure Fermi liquid and calculating (with standard methods of Bose-liquid theory) a temperature of superfluid transition in the large-bipolaron liquid we identify areas with presence of pseudogap (caused by impact of (bi)polaron potential on delocalized quasiparticles), CDW and superconductivity in a phase diagram. They are in the same places as in hole-doped cuprates, and similarly to cuprates the shape of the calculated phase diagram is stable with respect to wide-range change of the system characteristics. Like in cuprates, the calculated temperature of the superconducting transition increases with the number of conducting planes in the unit cell, the calculated superfluid density decreases with doping at overdoping, and the bipolaron density (together with bipolaronic plasmon energy) saturates at optimal doping. The results obtained allow us to discuss ways of increasing the temperature of the superfluid transition in large-bipolaron liquid and open a possibility of studying the current-carrying state and properties of bipolaron condensate.", "authors": "A.E.

As a result, the ground-state phase difference across a ferromagnetic Josephson junction oscillates between 0 and $\\pi$ as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic material. $\\pi$-junctions have been proposed as circuit elements in superconducting digital logic and in certain qubit designs for quantum computing.

Here, by introducing strain gradient in a centrosymmetric antiferromagnet Sr2IrO4, the space-inversion symmetry is broken accompanying a non-equivalent O p-Ir d orbital hybridization along z axis. Thus, emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment have been simultaneously observed in these asymmetric Sr2IrO4 thin films, which both are absent in its ground state. Furthermore, upon the application of magnetic field, such polarization can be controlled by modifying the occupied d orbitals through spin-orbit interaction, giving rise to a flexomagnetoelectric effect.

{"title": "Spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet: Machine learning discovery of the spinon pair density wave ground state", "abstract": "Spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) is one of the most studied models in frustrated magnetism since it is a promising candidate to host exotic spin liquid states. However, despite numerous studies using both analytical and numerical approaches, the nature of the ground state and low-energy excitations in this system remain elusive. This is related to the difficulty in determining the spin gap in various calculations. We present the results of our investigation of the Kagome AFM using the recently developed group equivariant convolutional neural networks - an advanced machine learning technique for studying strongly frustrated models. The approach, combined with variational Monte Carlo, introduces significant improvement of the achievable results accuracy in comparison with approaches based on other neural network architectures that lack generalization quality for frustrated spin systems. Contrary to the results obtained previously with various methods, that predicted Z_2 or U(1) Dirac spin liquid states, our results strongly indicate that the ground state of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet is a spinon pair density wave that does not break time-reversal symmetry or any of the lattice symmetries. The found state appears due to the spinon Cooper pairing instability close to two Dirac points in the spinon energy spectrum and resembles the pair density wave state studied previously in the context of underdoped cuprate superconductors in connection with the pseudogap phase. The state has significantly lower energy than the lowest energy states found by the SU(2) symmetric density matrix renormalization group calculations and other methods.", "authors": "Tanja Duric, Jia Hui Chung, Bo Yang, Pinaki Sengupta", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

We investigate the importance of such factors in the crystallization process of gold, silver, and iron nanodroplets using numerical simulations in the form of molecular dynamics combined with path sampling. This modeling strategy is targeted at obtaining representative ensembles of structures located at the transition state of the crystallization process. A structural analysis of the transition state ensembles reveals that both the average size and location of the critical nucleation cluster are influenced by surface and nanoscale size effets. Furthermore, we also show that transition state structures in smaller nanodroplets exhibit a more ordered liquid phase, and differentiating between a well-ordered critical cluster and its surrounding disordered liquid phase becomes less evident.

Fyodorov on random linear systems with quadratic constraints, using tools from Random Matrix Theory and replicas. These notes illustrate and complement the material presented at the Summer School organised within the Puglia Summer Trimester 2023 in Bari (Italy). Consider a system of $M$ linear equations in $N$ unknowns, $\\sum_{j=1}^N A_{kj}x_j=b_k$ for $k=1,\\ldots,M$, subject to the constraint that the solutions live on the $N$-sphere, $x_1^2+\\ldots + x_N^2=N$. Assume that both the coefficients $A_{ij}$ and the parameters $b_i$ be independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Using two different approaches -- based on Random Matrix Theory and on a replica calculation -- it is possible to compute whether a large linear system subject to a quadratic constraint is typically solvable or not, as a function of the ratio $\\alpha=M/N$ and the variance $\\sigma^2$ of the $b_i$'s. This is done by defining a quadratic loss function $H({\\bf x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^M\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^NA_{kj} x_j-b_k\\right]^2$ and computing the statistics of its minimal value on the sphere, $E_{min}=\\min_{||\\bf x||^2=N}H({\\bf x})$, which is zero if the system is compatible, and larger than zero if it is incompatible. One finds that there exists a compatibility threshold $0<\\alpha_c<1$, such that systems with $\\alpha>\\alpha_c$ are typically incompatible. This means that even weakly under-complete linear systems could become typically incompatible if forced to additionally obey a quadratic constraint.", "authors": "Pierpaolo Vivo", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Kibble-Zurek scalings and coarsening laws in slowly quenched classical Ising chains", "abstract": "We consider a one-dimensional classical ferromagnetic Ising model when it is quenched from a low temperature to zero temperature in finite time using Glauber or Kawasaki dynamics. Most of the previous work on finite-time quenches assume that the system is initially in equilibrium and focus on the excess defect density at the end of the quench which decays algebraically in quench time with Kibble-Zurek exponent. Here we are interested in understanding the conditions under which the Kibble-Zurek scalings do not hold and in elucidating the full dynamics of the defect density. We find that depending on the initial conditions and quench time, the dynamics of the defect density can be characterized by coarsening and/or the standard finite-time quench dynamics involving adiabatic evolution and Kibble-Zurek dynamics; the time scales for crossover between these dynamical phases are determined by coarsening time and stationary state relaxation time. As a consequence, the defect density at the end of the quench is either a constant or decays following coarsening laws or Kibble-Zurek scaling. For the Glauber chain, we formulate a low temperature scaling theory and find exact expressions for the final defect density for various initial conditions. For the Kawasaki chain where the dynamic exponents for coarsening and stationary state dynamics are different, we verify the above findings numerically and also examine the effect of unequal dynamic exponents.", "authors": "Lakshita Jindal, Kavita Jain", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

We argue that, in these high-Tc materials, besides bulk superconductivity in 3D domains there is also strongly enhanced 2D superconductivity emerging in the 3D-2D crossover region well above the superconducting transition temperature Tc. We study the possibility of the existence of distinct 3D and 2D superconducting phases in high-Tc ceramic cuprates, in which the unconventional Cooper pairs behave like bosons and condense below certain critical temperatures into 3D and 2D Bose superfluids in 3D and 2D domains. We show that the superconducting transition temperature in 2D domains is much higher than in 3D domains and can reach up to room temperature. We report signatures of room-temperature superconductivity occurring at different grain boundaries and 3D/2D interfaces and in multiplate blocks within the ceramic superconductors, synthesized by using the new melt technology in a large solar furnace. The samples of these materials synthesized under the influence of concentrated solar energy have the bulk Tc values ranging from 100 K to about 140 K and the more higher superconducting transition temperatures, possibly even as high as room temperature in the 3D-2D crossover region.

We show that time-periodic perturbations of moderate strength, in the sense that they do not heat up the system too quickly, give rise to the following phenomenon of stalled response: While the driving usually causes quite considerable reactions as long as the unperturbed system is far from equilibrium, the driving effects are strongly suppressed when the unperturbed system approaches thermal equilibrium. Likewise, for systems prepared near thermal equilibrium, the response to the driving is barely noticeable right from the beginning.

In this work, we show that the symmetries of the fermionic excitations are captured by a Projective Symmetry Group (PSG), which is a group extension of the bosonic symmetry group in the superconducting state. We further establish a correspondence between the pairing symmetry and the fermion PSG. When the normal and superconducting states share the same spin rotational symmetry, there is a simpler correspondence between the pairing symmetry and the fermion PSG, which we enumerate for all 32 crystalline point groups. We also discuss the general framework for computing PSGs when the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken in the superconducting state.

Motivated by the fundamental and industrial importance of these materials, we theoretically studied the electronic and magnetic properties of a relatively less explored Cr-based chalcogenide, namely LaCrS3 where 2D layers of magnetic Cr3+ ions form a rectangular lattice. We employed density functional theory + Hubbard U approach in conjunction with constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) where the later was used to estimate the strength of U. Our findings at ambient pressure show that the system exhibits semiconducting antiferromagnetic ground state with a gap of 0.5 eV and large Cr moments that corresponds to nominal S=3/2 spin-state. The 1st nearest neighbor (NN) interatomic exchange coupling (J1) is found to be strongly antiferromagnetic (AFM), while 2nd NN couplings are relatively weaker ferromagnetic (FM), making this system a candidate for 1D non-frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-chain family of materials.

Here, we design a plethora of such pair functions in direct and Fourier spaces across the first three Euclidean space dimensions that are realizable by diverse many-particle systems with varying degrees of correlated disorder across length scales, spanning a wide spectrum of hyperuniform, typical nonhyperuniform and antihyperuniform ones. This is accomplished by utilizing an efficient inverse algorithm that determines equilibrium states with up to pair interactions at positive temperature that precisely match targeted forms for both $g_2(r)$ and $S(k)$. Among other results, we realize an example with the strongest hyperuniform property among known positive-temperature equilibrium states, critical-point systems (implying unusual 1D systems with phase transitions) that are not in the Ising universality class, systems that attain self-similar pair statistics under Fourier transformation, and an experimentally feasible polymer model. We show that our pair functions enable one to achieve systems with a wide range of translational order and self-diffusion coefficients $\\cal D$, which are inversely related to one another.

We show that the nature of the ordered state changes from ferroelectric to antiferroelectric when the relative orientation of the rotor planes varies and that this change requires no modification of the overall symmetry. The observed quantum phase transitions are characterized by critical exponents and central charges which reveal different universality classes ranging from that of the (1+1)D Ising model to the 2D classical XY model.", "authors": "Tobias Serwatka, Pierre-Nicholas Roy", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Machine-learned models for magnetic materials", "abstract": "We present a general framework for modeling materials using deep neural networks. Material represented by multidimensional characteristics (that mimic measurements) is used to train the neural autoencoder model in an unsupervised manner. The encoder is trying to predict the material parameters of a theoretical model, which is then used in a decoder part. The decoder, using the predicted parameters, reconstructs the input characteristics. The neural model is trained to capture a synthetically generated set of characteristics that can cover a broad range of material behaviors, leading to a model that can generalize on the underlying physics rather than just optimize the model parameters for a single measurement. After setting up the model we prove its usefulness in the complex problem of modeling magnetic materials in the frequency and current (out-of-linear range) domains simultaneously.", "authors": "Paweł Leszczyński, Kamil Kutorasiński, Marcin Szewczyk, Jarosław Pawłowski", "date": " 29 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Universality of critical dynamics on a complex network", "abstract": "We investigate the role of the spectral dimension $d_s$ in determining the universality of phase transitions on a complex network. Due to its structural heterogeneity, a complex network generally acts as a disordered system. Specifically, we study the synchronization and entrainment transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Kuramoto model and the phase transition of the equilibrium dynamics of the classical $XY$ model, thereby covering a broad spectrum from nonlinear dynamics to statistical and condensed matter physics. Using linear theory, we obtain a general relationship between the dynamics occurring on the network and the underlying network properties. This yields the lower critical spectral dimension of the phase synchronization and entrainment transitions in the Kuramoto model as $d_s=4$ and $d_s=2$ respectively, whereas for the phase transition in the $XY$ model it is $d_s=2$. To test our theoretical hypotheses, we employ a network where any two nodes on the network are connected with a probability proportional to a power law of the distance between the nodes; this realizes any desired $d_s\\in [1, \\infty)$. Our detailed numerical study agrees well with the prediction of linear theory for the phase synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model. However, it shows a clear entrainment transition in the Kuramoto model and phase transition in the $XY$ model at $d_s \\gtrsim 3$, not $d_s=2$ as predicted by linear theory. Our study indicates that network disorder in the region $2 \\leq d_s \\lesssim 3$ seems to be relevant and have a profound effect on the dynamics.", "authors": "Mrinal Sarkar, Tilman Enss, Nicolò Defenu", "date": " 29 Dec 2023"},

Though many of the resulting alkali-metal and alkaline-earth MC2H8 phases are predicted to be dynamically stable at mild pressures, their superconducting critical temperatures (Tcs) are low because their metallicity results from the filling of an electride-like band. Substitution with a trivalent element leads to phases with substantial metal d-character at the Fermi level whose Tcs are typically above 40 K. Among the MB2H8 phases examined, KB2H8, RbB2H8 and CsB2H8 are predicted to be dynamically stable at very mild pressures, and their stability is rationalized by a DFT-Chemical Pressure analysis that elucidates the role of the M atom size. Quantum anharmonic effects strongly affect the properties of KB2H8, the highest predicted Tc compound, near 10 GPa, but molecular dynamics simulations reveal it would decompose below its Tc at this pressure. Nonetheless, at ca. 50 GPa KB2H8 is predicted to be thermally stable with a superconducting figure of merit surpassing that of the recently synthesized LaBeH8.", "authors": "Nisha Geng, Katerina P.

There are no studies of quantum plasmonics of large quantum dots of the size of Bohr excitonic radius or less that take electronic and geometric structure of the quantum dots. In this work, we studied extensively the absorption spectra of a protype quantum dot of sizeable ZnO of approximately 3.0 nm in diameter doped with Ga, and Al in diluted limit with density functional theory (DFT) plus Hubbard corrections (U). The localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) were then determined from the real part of the dielectric function by correlating the negative portion of it to resonant spectral lines. Our results show the sensitivity of the spectral lines to distribution of the dopants, the electronic structure of the dopants, the polarization of the electric field, and size of the quantum dots. Even though our findings are based on stoichiometrically simple ZnO, it shows that the DFT + U method with numerical atomic basis can be used at reasonable computational cost to study quantum plasmonics of few electrons taking into account electronic and geometric structures, which is missing currently.

Process mapping is typically performed by conventional methods and is used for the design of experiments and ex situ characterization of printed parts.

Our method relaxes these limitations by incorporating the temporal features of molten metal dynamics during laser-metal interactions using video vision transformers and high-speed imaging.

Inspired by recent work by Tada and Oshikawa, we propose a well-defined many-body bulk invariant for $C_n$ symmetric higher-order topological insulators, which is valid for both non-interacting and interacting systems. Instead of relating them to the bulk quadrupole moment as was previously done, we show that in the presence of $C_n$ rotational symmetry, this bulk invariant can be directly identified with quantized fractional corner charges. In particular, we prove that the corner charge is quantized as $e/n$ with $C_n$ symmetry, leading to a $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ classification for higher-order topological insulators in two dimensions.", "authors": "Ammar Jahin, Yuan-Ming Lu, Yuxuan Wang", "date": " 29 Dec 2023 ("},

In this study, we investigate on the relative resistance and current modulation of a 24-dimensional conductimetric electronic nose, which uses the exponential moving average as a floating reference in a low-cost information descriptor for environment recognition. In particular, we identified that depending on the structure of a linear classifier, the 'modema' descriptor is optimized for different material sensing elements' contributions to classify information patterns. The low-pass filtering optimization leads to opposite behaviors between unsupervised and supervised learning: the latter one favors longer integration of the reference, allowing to recognize five different classes over 90%, while the first one prefers using the latest events as its reference to clusterize patterns by environment nature.

{"title": "Steering of vortices by magnetic-field tilting in superconductor nanotubes", "abstract": "In planar superconductor thin films, the places of nucleation and arrangements of moving vortices are determined by structural defects. However, various applications of superconductors require reconfigurable steering of fluxons, which is hard to realize with geometrically predefined vortex pinning landscapes. Here, on the basis of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, we present an approach for steering of vortex chains and vortex jets in superconductor nanotubes containing a slit. The idea is based on tilting of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ at an angle $\\alpha$ in the plane perpendicular to the axis of a nanotube carrying an azimuthal transport current. Namely, while at $\\alpha=0^\\circ$ vortices move paraxially in opposite directions within each half-tube, an increase of $\\alpha$ displaces the areas with the close-to-maximum normal component $|B_\\mathrm{n}|$ to the close(opposite)-to-slit regions, giving rise to descending (ascending) branches in the induced-voltage frequency spectrum $f_\\mathrm{U}(\\alpha)$. At lower $B$, upon reaching the critical angle $\\alpha_\\mathrm{c}$, close-to-slit vortex chains disappear, yielding $f_\\mathrm{U}$ of the $nf_1$-type ($n\\geq1$: an integer; $f_1$: vortex nucleation frequency). At higher $B$, $f_\\mathrm{U}$ is largely blurry because of multifurcations of vortex trajectories, leading to the coexistence of a vortex jet with two vortex chains at $\\alpha=90^\\circ$. In addition to prospects for tuning of GHz-frequency spectra and steering of vortices as information bits, our findings lay foundations for on-demand tuning of vortex arrangements in 3D superconductor membranes in tilted magnetic fields.", "authors": "Igor Bogush, Oleksandr V.

An exciting recent progress along this direction is the discovery of significant nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance and nonlinear Hall effect in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 induced by the quantum metric dipole. Given the importance of this finding, the inconsistent response with charge density, and conflicting requirement of C3z symmetry, it is imperative to elucidate every detail that may impact the nonlinear transport measurement. In this study, we reveal an intriguing experimental factor that inevitably gives rise to sizable nonlinear transport signal in MnBi2Te4. We demonstrate that this effect stems from the gate voltage oscillation caused by the application of a large alternating current to the sample. Furthermore, we propose a methodology to significantly suppress this effect by individually grounding the voltage electrodes during the second-harmonic measurements.

Despite that they have the same atomic structure, the two monolayers exhibit distinct magnetic properties. FePS3 holds an out-of-plane zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM-ZZ) structure, while NiPS3 exhibits an in-plane AFM-ZZ structure. However, there is no theoretical model which can properly describe its magnetic ground state due to the lack of a full understanding of its magnetic interactions. Here, by combining the first-principles calculations and the newly developed machine learning method, we construct an exact spin Hamiltonian of the two magnetic materials. Different from the previous studies which failed to fully consider the spin-orbit coupling effect, we find that the AFM-ZZ ground state in FePS3 is stabilized by competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, and combining single-ion anisotropy. Whereas, the often ignored nearest-neighbor biquadratic exchange is responsible for the in-plane AFM-ZZ ground state in NiPS3. We additionally calculate spin-wave spectrum of AFM-ZZ structure in the two monolayers based on the exact spin Hamiltonian, which can be directly verified by the experimental investigation.

Unexpectedly, the LL gaps are roughly constant over a wide range of magnetic fields below the transitions, which we show reflects a preference for opposite spin excitations of the spin-polarized ground state. These transitions also extend into compressible regimes, with a sawtooth boundary between full and partial spin polarization.

We compare the search efficiency with that corresponding to reset to the origin and find that the mean first passage time of the latter can be larger or smaller than the distributed case, depending on whether the resetting points are symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed. In particular, we prove the existence of an optimal reset rate that minimizes the mean first-passage time for distributed resetting to a finite interval if the target is located outside this interval. When the target position belongs to the resetting interval or it is infinite then no optimal reset rate exists, but there is an optimal resetting interval width or resetting characteristic scale which minimizes the mean first-passage time. We also show that the first-passage density averaged over the resetting points depends on its first moment only. As a consequence, there is an equivalent point such that the first-passage problem with resetting to that point is statistically equivalent to the case of distributed resetting.

In the case of internal energies or the general case of divalent electrolytes mainly governed by charge correlations, the improved accuracy of the CCDH theory is limited to submolar ion concentrations. Comparison with experimental data from the literature shows that via the adjustment of the hydrated ion radii, the CCDH formalism can equally reproduce the non-uniform effect of salt increment on the ionic activity coefficients up to molar concentrations.

X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements attest well the high quality of our polycrystalline samples that crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with the Pbam space group. The Raman phonon frequencies were carried out and compared with the lattice dynamics calculations to identify the vibrational properties of all detected modes at room temperature. As expected, our magnetic study reveals that the magnetization was enhanced by the substitution of Y$^{3+}$ by Dy$^{3+}$. The Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ sets the Néel transition [TN (Mn)] in the temperature range going from 40 to 45 K favoring the emergence of a transition at a very low temperature due to the long-range ordering of the Dy3+ magnetic moments below 13K [TN (Dy)]. Dual peaks in the magnetic entropy change curve are also observed being in good agreement with magnetization data, which enlarges the range of application of these materials. On the other hand, a large magnetocaloric effect is observed close to 13 K which is mainly due the ordering of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic moments. Also, the incommensurate antiferromagnetic transition of Mn magnetic moment taking place around 40 K affects slightly the entropy change.

{"title": "RKKY signals characterizing the topological phase transitions in Floquet Dirac semimetals", "abstract": "Recently, the Floquet ${\\rm Na_3Bi}$-type material has been proposed as an ideal platform for realizing various phases, i.e., the spin-degenerate Dirac semimetal (DSM) can be turned into the Weyl semimetal (WSM), and even to the Weyl half-metal (WHM). Instead of the conventional electrical methods, we use the RKKY interaction to characterize the topological phase transitions in this paper. It is found that detecting the Ising term $J_I$ is feasible for distinguishing the phase transition of DSM/WSM, since the emergence of $J_I$ is induced by the broken spin degeneracy. For the case with impurities deposited on $z$ axis (the line connecting the Weyl points), the Heisenberg term $J_H$ coexists with $J_I$ in the WSM, while $J_H$ is filtered out and only $J_I$ survives in the WHM. This magnetic filtering effect is a reflection of the fully spin-polarized property (one spin band is in the WSM phase while the other is gapped) of the WHM, and it can act a signal to capture the phase transition of WSM/WHM. This signal can not be disturbed unless the direction of the impurities greatly deviates from $z$ axis. Interestingly, as the impurities are moved into the $x$-$y$ plane, there arises another signal (a dip structure for $J_H$ at the phase boundary), which can also identify the phase transition of WSM/WHM. Furthermore, we have verified that all magnetic signals are robust to the term that breaks the electron-hole symmetry. Besides characterizing the phase transitions, our results also suggest that the Floquet DSMs are power platforms for controlling the magnetic interaction.", "authors": "Hou-Jian Duan, Shi-Ming Cai, Xing Wei, Yong-Chi Chen, Yong-Jia Wu, Ming-Xun Deng, Ruiqiang Wang, Mou Yang", "date": " 2 Jan 2024 ("},
{"title": "Evolution of the pseudogap temperature dependence in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ films under the influence of a magnetic field", "abstract": "The evolution of the temperature dependence of pseudogap $\\Delta$*(T) in optimally doped (OD) YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (YBCO) films with $T_{c}$ = 88.7 K under the influence of a magnetic field $B$ up to 8 T has been studied in detail. It has been established that the shape of $\\Delta$*(T) for various $B$ over the entire range from the pseudogap opening temperature $T$* to $T_{01}$, below which superconducting fluctuations occur, has a wide maximum at the BEC-BCS crossover temperature $T_{pair}$, which is typical for OD films and untwinned YBCO single crystals. $T$* was shown to be independent on $B$, whereas $T_{pair}$ shifts to the low temperature region along with increase of $B$, while the maximum value of $\\Delta$*($T_{pair}$) remains practically constant regardless of $B$. It was revealed that as the field increases, the low-temperature maximum near the 3D-2D transition temperature $T_{0}$ is blurred and disappears at $B$ > 5 T. Moreover, above the Ginzburg temperature $T_{G}$, which limits superconducting fluctuations from below, at $B$ > 0.5 T, a minimum appears on $\\Delta$*(T) at $T_{min}$, which becomes very pronounced with a further increase in the field. As a result, the overall value of $\\Delta$*(T) decreases noticeably most likely due to pair-breaking affect of a magnetic field. A comparison of $\\Delta$*(T) near $T_{c}$ with the Peters-Bauer theory shows that the density of fluctuating Cooper pairs actually decreases from <<n$_{\\uparrow}$n$_{\\downarrow}$>> $\\approx$ 0.31 at $B$ = 0 to <<n$_{\\uparrow}$n$_{\\downarrow}$>> $\\approx$ 0.28 in the field 8 T. The observed behavior of $\\Delta$*(T) around $T_{min}$ is assumed to be due to the influence of a two-dimensional vortex lattice created by the magnetic field, which prevents the formation of fluctuating Cooper pairs near $T_{c}$.", "authors": "E.

When sugar molecules are recognized by the phenylboronic site, the response of electrochemical voltammetry of the Ru site changes, enabling the system to work as a sensitive sugar-sensor. In this recognition process, the change in the electronic state at the boron site caused by sugar must be transferred to the Ru site via alkyl chains. We have utilized the muon-labelled electrons method and the proton NMR to find out a channel of the electron transfer from the phenylboronic acid site to the gold nano particle via the one dimensional alkyl chain. If this transfer is driven by diffusive spin channel, characteristic field dependence is expected in the longitudinal spin relaxation rate of muSR and 1H-NMR.

For this we calculate the layer-resolved susceptibility tensor of a synthetic antiferromagnet, the effective magneto-elastic and magneto-rotation fields associated to a travelling elastic wave, and the power irreversibly transferred by the elastic wave to the magnetic layers. We consider Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves: (a) that travel in an elastically isotropic, non-piezoelectric substrate, or (b) that propagate along the X direction at the surface of a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ substrate, or (c) that are guided in a thin Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ film grown on a sapphire substrate. In particular, we show that the complementary angular dependencies of the acoustic and optical spin wave modes in synthetic antiferromagnets makes it possible to excite spin waves for any relative orientation of magnetization and acoustic wavevector.

By switching on the Heisenberg interaction together with magnetic field, only one zero-energy state persists, which can be used as an initialization of qubits. Furthermore, it is shown that $3L+2$ qubits are constructed on the Kitaev spin liquid model on connected $L$ hexagons.

A limitation of these novel materials, which is being increasingly commonly found, is carrier localization, which substantially reduces mobilities and diffusion lengths. Herein, the layered příbramite CuSbSe2 is investigated and discovered to have delocalized free carriers, as shown through optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy and temperature-dependent mobility measurements. Using a combination of theory and experiment, it is found that the underlying factors are: 1) weak coupling to acoustic phonons due to low deformation potentials, as lattice distortions are primarily accommodated through rigid inter-layer movement rather than straining inter-atomic bonds, and 2) weak coupling to optical phonons due to the ionic contributions to the dielectric constant being low compared to electronic contributions.

In this paper, we systematically study topological superconducting (TSC) phases in monolayer NbSe2 through mixing on-site s-wave pairing (ps) with nearest-neighbor pairing (psA1) based on a tight-binding model. We observe rich phases with both fixed and sensitive Chern numbers (CNs) depending on the chemical potential ({\\mu}) and out-of-plane magnetic field (Vz). As the psA1 increases, the TSC phase manifests matching and mismatching features according to whether there is a bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC). Strikingly, the introduction of mixed wave pairing significantly reduces the critical Vz to form TSC phases compared with the pure s-wave paring. Moreover, the TSC phase can be modulated even at Vz=0 under appropriate {\\mu} and psA1, which is identified by the robust topological edge states (TESs) of ribbons. Additionally, the mixed pairing influences the hybridization of bulk and edge states, resulting in a matching/mismatching BBC with localized/oscillating TESs on the ribbon.

However, in this study, we have made a noteworthy observation: although the electron-phonon coupling alone is insufficient to account for the observed ARPES pattern, our analysis reveals that when the instantaneous electron-phonon coupling occurring in selective phonon channel is enhanced by the coexistence of antiferromagnetic spin density wave and charge density wave phenomena, the amplified interaction becomes comparable to the ARPES range. This finding suggests that the instantaneous interplay between these intricate phenomena should play a crucial role in generating the observed energy range in ARPES.

Previous studies show that electron-phonon interactions have strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity of GaN due to the Fröhlich interaction. Surprisingly, our investigation reveals weak effects of phonon-electron interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of n-type GaN at ultra-high electron concentrations, and the impact of the Fröhlich interaction can be ignored. The small phonon-electron scattering rate is attributed to the limited scattering channels, quantified by the Fermi surface nesting function. In contrast, there is a significant reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of p-type GaN at high hole concentrations due to the large Fermi surface nesting function. However, as p-type GaN has relatively smaller electron-phonon matrix elements, the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity is weaker than that observed in p-type silicon.

Moreover, we have identified a specific antiferromagnetic phonon that contributes significantly to the high Tc observed in YBCO. This finding highlights the significance of these effects in achieving high Tc values. Our study not only identifies an imbalanced charge-density wave effect for triggering selective electron-phonon coupling but also explains why the charge density wave usually occurs around the magnetic copper atoms. Furthermore, our research reveals limitations in the conventional mean-field ab-initio approximation used for antiferromagnetic fluctuations in YBCO. It shows that the dynamic behavior of electrons in YBCO might not be accurately captured by this approximation, as non-uniform magnetic fields under antiferromagnetic fluctuations induce an additional electric potential on electrons across the boundary between non-magnetic to magnetic sites instantaneously. This instantaneous electric potential, in turn, suggest that the influence of the antiferromagnetic phonon-based pairing mechanism might not have been optimized in theory", "authors": "Chi Ho Wong, Rolf Lortz", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Generalized Spectral Form Factor in Random Matrix Theory", "abstract": "The spectral form factor (SFF) plays a crucial role in revealing the statistical properties of energy level distributions in complex systems. It is one of the tools to diagnose quantum chaos and unravel the universal dynamics therein. The definition of SFF in most literature only encapsulates the two-level correlation. In this manuscript, we extend the definition of SSF to include the high-order correlation. Specifically, we introduce the standard deviation of energy levels to define correlation functions, from which the generalized spectral form factor (GSFF) can be obtained by Fourier transforms. GSFF provides a more comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of chaotic systems. Using random matrices as examples, we demonstrate new dynamics features that are encoded in GSFF. Remarkably, the GSFF is complex, and both the real and imaginary parts exhibit universal dynamics. For instance, in the two-level correlated case, the real part of GSFF shows a dip-ramp-plateau structure akin to the conventional counterpart, and the imaginary part for different system sizes converges in the long time limit. For the two-level GSFF, the closed analytical forms of the real part are obtained and consistent with numerical results. The results of the imaginary part are obtained by numerical calculation.

Our results augment the model of active Brownian particles with rigorous expressions for the dissipation that cannot be inferred from their equations of motion, and we illustrate consequences for wall aggregation and motility-induced phase separation.

This limitation severely hinders the advancement of several emerging technologies including biomimetic robots, assembly-based manufacturing, precision medicine, wearable and implantable devices, as well as on-demand material dismantling and recycling for sustainability. Here we present a design approach for strong and highly switchable adhesion by synergizing the surface stickiness, bulk energy dissipation, and stimuli-responsive polymer chains in a thermo-switchable soft sticky adhesive. The adhesive has a high adhesion strength of about 80 kPa with diverse materials at room temperature. The adhesion is highly switchable to near-vanishing (about 0.6 kPa) at an elevated temperature due to the thermo-responsive surface polymer chain retraction. This adhesion switching is reversible and repeatable for many cycles, enabling selective pick-and-release of objects with various materials, shapes, sizes, and weights. The switching time is around 10 s with an adhesive layer of 1 mm, governed by thermal conduction through the adhesive, faster than or comparable to most state-of-the-art methods.

In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry show that the reaction onset is correlated with the Zn$X_2$ melting point and that product purity is inversely correlated with the reaction's exothermicity. High resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measurements show that this bulk synthesis produces a structure with substantial cation ordering, as opposed to the disordered structure initially discovered via thin film sputtering. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy reveals that Zn$_3$WN$_4$ powders exhibit two optical absorption onsets at 2.5 eV and 4.0 eV, indicating wide-bandgap semiconducting behavior and suggesting a small amount of structural disorder. We hypothesize that this synthesis strategy is generalizable because many potential Li-$M$-N precursors (where $M$ is a metal) are available for synthesizing new ternary nitride materials.

{"title": "Observation of Liquid Glass in Molecular Dynamics Simulations", "abstract": "Molecular anisotropy plays an important role in the glass transition of a liquid. Recently, a novel glass state has been discovered by optical microscopy experiments on suspensions of ellipsoidal colloids. 'Liquid glass' is a disordered analog of a nematic liquid crystal, where rotation motion is hindered but particles diffuse freely. Global nematic order is suppressed as clusters of aligned particles intertwine. We perform Brownian dynamics simulations to test the structure and dynamics of a dense system of soft ellipsoidal particles. As seen in experiments and in accordance with predictions from mode coupling theory, on the time scale of our simulations rotation motion is frozen but translation motion persists in liquid glass. Analyses of the dynamic structure functions for translation and rotation corroborates the presence of two separate glass transitions for rotation and translation, respectively. Even though the equilibrium state should be a nematic, aligned structures remain small and orientational order rapidly decays with increasing size. Long-wavelength fluctuations are remnants of the isotropic-nematic transition.", "authors": "Mohammed Alhissi, Andreas Zumbusch, Matthias Fuchs", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Decoupling of rotation and translation at the colloidal glass transition", "abstract": "Little is known about the coupling of rotation and translation in dense systems. Here, we report results of confocal fluorescence microscopy where simultaneous recording of translational and rotational particle trajectories from a bidisperse colloidal dispersion is achieved by spiking the samples with rotational probe particles. The latter consist of colloidal particles containing two fluorescently labelled cores suited for tracking the particle's orientation. A comparison of the experimental data with event driven Brownian simulations gives insight into the system's structure and dynamics close to the glass transition and sheds new light onto the translation-rotation coupling. The data show that with increasing volume fractions, translational dynamics slows down drastically, whereas rotational dynamics changes very little. We find convincing agreement between simulation and experiments, even though the simulations neglect far-field hydrodynamic interactions. An additional analysis of the glass transition following mode coupling theory works well for the structural dynamics but indicates a decoupling of the diffusion of the smaller particle species. The shear stress correlations do not decorrelate in the simulated glass states and are not affected by rotational motion.", "authors": "John Geiger, Niklas Grimm, Matthis Fuchs, Andreas Zumbusch", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

We consider different core groups constituted by countries preferring to trade in a specific currency. We will consider principally two core groups, namely, 5 Anglo-Saxon countries which prefer to trade in US dollar and the 11 BRICS+ which prefer to trade in a hypothetical currency, hereafter called BRI, pegged to their economies. We determine the trade currency preference of the other countries via a Monte Carlo process depending on the direct transactions between the countries. The results obtained in the frame of this mathematical model show that starting from year 2014 the majority of the world countries would have preferred to trade in BRI than USD. The Monte Carlo process reaches a steady state with 3 distinct groups: two groups of countries preferring, whatever is the initial distribution of the trade currency preferences, to trade, one in BRI and the other in USD, and a third group of countries swinging as a whole between USD and BRI depending on the initial distribution of the trade currency preferences.

The ability of these band nodes to annihilate pairwise is path dependent, since by braiding nodes in adjacent gaps the sign of their charges can be changed. Here, we theoretically construct and numerically confirm two concrete methods to experimentally probe these non-Abelian braiding processes and charges in ultracold atomic systems. We consider a coherent superposition of two bands that can be created by moving atoms through the band singularities at some angle in momentum space. Analyzing the dependency on the frame charges, we demonstrate an interferometry scheme passing through two band nodes, which reveals the relative frame charges and allows for measuring the multi-gap topological invariant. The second method relies on a single wavepacket probing two nodes sequentially, where the frame charges can be determined from the band populations. Our results present a feasible avenue for measuring non-Abelian charges of band nodes and the experimental verification of braiding procedures directly, which can be applied in a variety of settings including the recently discovered anomalous non-Abelian phases arising under periodic driving.", "authors": "Oliver Breach, Robert-Jan Slager, F.

{"title": "Sensitivity of peptide conformational dynamics in carbon nanotubes to directional mechanical forces", "abstract": "In living organisms, proteins and peptides are often under the influence of mechanical forces, especially in confined spaces such as membrane channels, ribosome exit tunnel, or proteasome gate. Due to the directional nature of proteins as polymers with distinct ends, forces have the potential to influence protein conformational dynamics in a direction-dependent manner. In this study, we employed force-probe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of pulling a peptide through a confined environment versus pushing it in the same direction. Our model involves a carbon nanotube and one of three decapeptides with varying amino acid sequences. The simulations reveal that the difference between pulling the C-terminus and pushing the N-terminus is relatively minor when considering the conformational ensembles of the peptides. The loading rate of the force probe and the amino acid sequence of the peptide play a more important role. However, the application of force to the peptide significantly influences the relative motion of the peptides with respect to the nanotube. Pulling the peptide results in a smoother translocation through the nanotube compared to pushing, although the internal conformational dynamics of the peptide add complexity in either case. Our findings shed light on how short peptides navigate confined spaces within the cellular environment, emphasizing the importance of force-probe simulation studies in understanding these processes.", "authors": "Felipe C.

By using different laser writing parameters, we have explored the features of different electrodes in a (100) and a (110) oriented diamond crystal respectively. We show that in addition to the use of specific pulse energies and durations (in the fs and ps regimes), the crystallographic orientation of the sample plays an important role in reducing or eliminating the potential barrier height of the IV electrical characterization curves.

The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process.

{"title": "Topological transmission in Suzuki phase sonic crystals", "abstract": "This work reports topological extraordinary properties of sound transmission through topological states in sonic crystals denominated Suzuki phase, consisting of a rectangular lattice of vacancies created in a triangular lattice. These low-symmetry crystals exhibit unique properties due to the embedded lattice of vacancies. A generalized folding method explains the band structure and the quasi-type-II Dirac point in the Suzuki phase, which is related to the underlying triangular lattice. In analogy to the acoustic valley Hall effect, the Suzuki phase contains three types of topological edge states on the four possible interfaces separating two Suzuki phase crystals with distinct topological phases. The edge states have defined symmetries with inherent directionality, which affect the topological sound transmission and are different from chirality, valley vorticity or helicity. Particularly, the existence of topological deaf bands is here reported. The propagation of topological eigenmodes on the same interface is also different, which is quantified using the acoustic Shannon entropy, making the topological transport dependent on the frequency of the edge states. Based on the abundant topological edge states of Suzuki phase crystals, a multifunctional device with acoustic diodes, multi-channel transmission, and selective acoustic transmission can be designed. Numerical simulations and measurements demonstrate the topological transmission.

Due to the nontrivial structure of the Hilbert space of LGT systems, entanglement in such systems is tricky to define. However, when one limits themselves to superselection-resolved entanglement, that is, entanglement corresponding to specific gauge symmetry sectors (commonly denoted as superselection sectors), this problem disappears, and the entanglement becomes well-defined. The study of superselection-resolved entanglement is interesting in LGT for an additional reason: when the gauge symmetry is strictly obeyed, superselection-resolved entanglement becomes the only distillable contribution to the entanglement. In our work, we study the behavior of superselection-resolved entanglement in LGT systems. We employ a tensor network construction for gauge-invariant systems as defined by Zohar and Burrello (2016) and find that, in a vast range of cases, the leading term in superselection-resolved entanglement depends on the number of corners in the partition, that is, corner-law entanglement.

The scaling arises from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\\text{eff}} \\sim q^{-1}$. Moreover, the timescales of information protection are explored and shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$ scaling for temporally uncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The former scaling can be interpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the latter is a direct consequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct extensive numerical simulations using stabilizer formalism to support the theoretical understanding. This Letter not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum noises and measurement-induced phase transition but also provides a new perspective to understand the effects of Markovian and non-Markovian noises on quantum computation.", "authors": "Shuo Liu, Ming-Rui Li, Shi-Xin Zhang, Shao-Kai Jian", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "On the Engulfment of Antifreeze Proteins by Ice", "abstract": "Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are remarkable biomolecules that suppress ice formation at trace concentrations. To inhibit ice growth, AFPs must not only bind to ice crystals, but also resist engulfment by ice. The highest supercooling, $\\Delta T^{*}$, for which AFPs are able to resist engulfment is widely believed to scale as the inverse of the separation, $L$, between bound AFPs, whereas its dependence on the molecular characteristics of the AFP remains poorly understood. By using specialized molecular simulations and interfacial thermodynamics, here we show that in contrast with conventional wisdom, $\\Delta T^{*}$ scales as $L^{-2}$ and not as $L^{-1}$. We further show that $\\Delta T^{*}$ is proportional to AFP size and that diverse naturally occurring AFPs are optimal at resisting engulfment by ice. By facilitating the development of AFP structure-function relationships, we hope that our findings will pave the way for the rational design of novel AFPs.", "authors": "Aniket U.

Furthermore, our design demonstrates direct coupling efficiency over 90% into a single-mode fiber over the entire telecom C-band.

{"title": "Active fluid networks excite visco-elastic modes for efficient transport", "abstract": "Active fluid transport is a hallmark of many biological transport networks. While animal circulatory systems generally rely on a single heart to drive flows, other organisms employ decentralized local pumps to distribute fluids and nutrients. Here, we study the decentralized pumping mechanism in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum which is locally triggered by active release, uptake, and transport of a chemical solute within the organism's vascular network to drive global oscillations.Based on a conceptual network model combining active elasticity and fluid transport we identify a set of contractile modes specific to each network and show that modes corresponding to large-scale oscillations are preferentially and robustly excited both in model simulations and in experimental data obtained from living Physarum plasmodia. These dominant modes are computed explicitly and shown to drive large-scale flows within the organism. Furthermore, Physarum must transport nutrients over long distances. As each mode corresponds to pure shuttle flow, long-range, directed transport must rely on a non-linear coupling beyond harmonic dynamics. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the network's transport capability is optimized when two dominant modes are excited at a phase shift of $\\pi/2$, resulting in contractile excitations similar to those observed in real Physarum. Our results provide a conceptual framework for understanding active decentralized transport in Physarum and other contractile biological networks, such as brain vasculature, as well as decentralized transportation networks more generally.", "authors": "Adam B.

In this study, we demonstrate the compatibility of high-stress and crystalline (3C-phase) silicon-carbide membranes with superconducting microwave circuits. We establish a coherent electromechanical interface for long-lived phonons, allowing precise control over the electromechanical cooperativity. This interface enables tunable slow-light time with group delays extending up to an impressive duration of \\emph{an hour}.

To alleviate the covariance-expressiveness dilemma, we propose a hybrid framework with two cascaded regression stages. The first stage, with a theoretically-guaranteed covariant neural network modeling symmetry properties of 3D atom systems, yields theoretically covariant features and baseline Hamiltonian predictions, assisting the second stage in learning covariance. Meanwhile, the second stage, powered by a non-linear 3D graph Transformer network we propose for structural modeling of 3D atomic systems, refines the first stage's output as a fine-grained prediction of Hamiltonians with better expressiveness capability. The combination of a theoretically covariant yet inevitably less expressive model with a highly expressive non-linear network enables precise, generalizable predictions while maintaining robust covariance under coordinate transformations.

Also, frequent in vitro concentration measurements rely on fluorescence-based methods or direct slicing of the matrix for analyses. These traditional approaches become unreliable if localized and in situ analyses are needed. In contrast, for in situ and real-time analysis of target analytes, surface-engineered optical fibers can be leveraged as a powerful miniaturized tool, which has shown promise from bio to environmental studies. Herein, we demonstrate an optical fiber functionalized with gold nanoparticles using a dip-coating process to investigate the interaction of light with molecules at or near the surface of the optical fiber. Localized surface plasmon resonance from the light-matter interaction enables the detection of minute changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium. We used this principle to assess the in situ molecular distribution of a synthetic drug (methylene blue) in an in vitro matrix (agarose gel) having varying concentrations.

Traditionally, calculating the manually constructed molecular conformations of transition states for chemical reactions using quantum chemical calculations is the most commonly used method. However, this way is heavily dependent on individual experience and chemical intuition. In our previous study, we proposed a research paradigm that uses enhanced sampling in QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations to study chemical reactions. This approach can directly simulate the entire process of a chemical reaction. However, the computational speed limits the use of high-precision potential energy functions for simulations. To address this issue, we present a scheme for training high-precision force fields for molecular modeling using our developed graph-neural-network-based molecular model, molecular configuration transformer. This potential energy function allows for highly accurate simulations at a low computational cost, leading to more precise calculations of the mechanism of chemical reactions.

This distinction is robust against small parameter deviations in the non-Hermitian perturbations. We further study four well-known models that support Majorana or parafermionic zero modes. By calculating their dynamical responses to specific non-Hermitian perturbations, we prove that the steady-state LE can indeed differentiate between different phases.

However, their behavior during phase change processes, such as melting or solidification, remains inadequately understood\\@. This investigation focuses on the melting process of NePCM in a square cavity, exploring distinct cases of melting from both the top and bottom sides. The NePCM comprises copper nanoparticles (2 nm in size) suspended in water. Our study involves different combinations of constant temperature boundary conditions and particle volume fractions\\@. Utilizing a numerical model based on the one-fluid mixture approach combined with the single-domain enthalpy-porosity model, we account for the phase change process and particles' interaction with the solid-liquid interface. When melting NePCM from the top side, convection effects are suppressed, resulting in a melting process primarily governed by conduction. Both NePCM and pure water melt at the same rate under these conditions. However, melting NePCM from the bottom side induces convection-dominated melting. For pure water, thermal convection leads to the formation of convection cells during melting. Contrastingly, melting NePCM triggers thermosolutal convection due to temperature and particle concentration gradients. The flow cells formed from thermosolutal convection in NePCM differ from those in pure water driven by pure thermal convection. Our simulations reveal that thermosolutal convection contributes to decelerating the solid-liquid interface, thereby prolonging NePCM melting compared to pure water. Surprisingly, the viscosity increase in NePCM plays a minimal role in the deceleration process, contrary to prior literature attributing slow-downs of the melting process of the NePCM primarily to increased viscosity.", "authors": "Yousef El Hasadi", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

Moreover, using analytical methods like EDS and XPS shed light on the changes in the atomic composition, specifically focusing on the C and O elements, as a result of laser exposure.

The interaction between bulk and defect can lead to rich physical phenomena. Defects in gapless phases of matter with conformal symmetry usually flow to a defect conformal field theory (dCFT). Understanding the universal properties of dCFTs is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computational strategy applicable to a line defect in arbitrary dimensions. Our main assumption is that the defect has an UV description in terms of a local modification of the Hamiltonian, so that we can compute the overlap between low-energy eigenstates of a system with or without the defect insertion. We argue that these overlaps contains a wealth of conformal data, including the $g$-function, which is an RG monotonic quantity that distinguishes different dCFTs, the scaling dimensions of defect creation operators $\\Delta^{+0}_\\alpha$ and changing operators $\\Delta^{+-}_\\alpha$ that live on the intersection of different types of line defects, and various OPE coefficients.

The highest conductivity of 9.95 x 10-4 S/cm was obtained for a 0.05 Ca ceramic sample with minimum activation energy of 0.23 eV.

{"title": "Eigenstates in the self-organised criticality", "abstract": "We employ the eigen microstate approach to explore the self-organized criticality (SOC) in two celebrated sandpile models, namely, the BTW model and the Manna model. In both models, phase transitions from the absorbing-state to the critical state can be understood by the emergence of dominant eigen microstates with significantly increased weights. Spatial eigen microstates of avalanches can be uniformly characterized by a linear system size rescaling. The first temporal eigen microstates reveal scaling relations in both models. Furthermore, by finite-size scaling analysis of the first eigen microstate, we numerically estimate critical exponents i.e., $\\sqrt{\\sigma_0 w_1}/\\tilde{v}_{1} \\propto L^D$ and $\\tilde{v}_{1} \\propto L^{D(1-\\tau_s)/2}$.

While the studied configuration is related to both devices proposed for use with topological insulators as well as other proposals for Majorana modes without applied magnetic fields, we find that placing the superconductor on both surfaces allows us to replace the topological insulator by a wider variety of spin-orbit coupled semiconductors. Application of an electric field in the junction together with appropriate superconducting phase differences allows different Fermi surfaces to be subject to different phase differences. We find that these conditions can drive the system into a class-D topological superconductor with a pair of Majorana modes at the two ends of the junction. Additionally, class-DIII topological superconductors with helical Majorana modes also occur in other parts of the phase diagram. We simulate our setup on HgTe near the valence band edge described by the well-known 8-band Kane model with realistic parameters and find phase diagram can be achieved.

Er adatoms display two main adsorption configurations that are optically excited between 800 nm and 1200 nm while the STM reads the resulting photocurrents. Our spectroscopic method reveals that various photocurrent signals stem from the bare silicon surface or Er adatoms. Additional photocurrent peaks appear as the signature of the Er adatoms relaxation, triggering efficient dissociation of nearby trapped excitons. Calculations using the density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling correction highlight the origin of the observed photocurrent peaks as specific 4f->4f or 4f->5d transitions.

We find strong EPC and a softening of phonon modes in the lowest acoustic branch. While the single MoS$_2$ layer does not actively contribute to the EPC, it significantly elevates the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) compared to monolayer NbSe$_2$. This is attributed to the degradation of the charge-density wave (CDW) by the MoS$_2$ layer. Notably, we observe a two-gap superconductivity in $\\rm{NbSe_2}$/$\\rm{MoS_2}$ and extend our study to three layers of NbSe$_2$. A reduction in $T_c$ with increasing thickness of NbSe$_2$ is observed. We confirm that this trend is consistent with recent experiments, if one goes beyond three layers of NbSe$_2$. We incorporated spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and suggest a possible mechanism for Ising superconductivity.

Our approach accurately describes the nonadiabatic effects in CO scattering from Au(111) without empirical parameters and yields results agreeing well with experiments under various conditions for this benchmark system. We find that both adiabatic and nonadiabatic energy loss channels have important contributions to the vibrational relaxation of highly vibrationally excited CO(vi = 17), whereas relaxation of low vibrationally excited states of CO(vi = 2) is weak and dominated by nonadiabatic energy loss.

These chiral edge channels conduct dissipationless transport in QAH insulators, making them pivotal for applications in low-consumption electronics and topological quantum computing. While the QAH effect with multiple chiral edge channels (i.e., C >1) has been demonstrated in multilayers consisting of magnetic topological insulators and normal insulators, the channel number remains fixed for a given sample. Here, we unveil the tunability of the number of chiral edge channels within a single QAH insulator device. By tuning the magnetization of individual layers within the multilayer system, Chern insulating states with different Chern numbers are unveiled. The tunable Chern number was corroborated by our theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we conducted layer-dependent calculations to elucidate the contribution of the Chern number from different layers in the multilayer.

By calculating the density dynamic structure factor, we find anisotropic dynamical excitations in both collective modes and single-particle excitations. Along the direction of centre-of-mass momentum $p$, there are two obvious gapless collective modes with different speed. The lower collective modes is from the usual gauge symmetry breaking and has a larger speed than the one in the negative direction of $p$. The higher one is due to the direction spontaneous symmetry breaking of centre-of-mass momentum $p$, and separates two kinds of single-particle excitations in the positive $p$ direction. However, this higher mode disappears in the opposite direction of $p$, where two single-particle excitations overlap with each other. These signals of dynamical excitations can do help to distinguish Fulde-Ferrell superfluid from the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid in the future experiment.", "authors": "Peng Zou, Huaisong Zhao, Feng Yuan, Shi-Guo Peng", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

In these materials the anisotropic local crystal environment of the different sublattices lowers the symmetry of the system so that the opposite-spin sublattices are connected only by rotations, which results in an unconventional spin-polarized band structure in the momentum space. This low symmetry of the crystal structure is expected to be reflected in the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we study the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of Mn$_5$Si$_3$, an altermagnetic candidate material. We first demonstrate a change in the relative Néel vector orientation when rotating the external field orientation through systematic changes in both the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic longitudinal magnetoresistance. We then show that the anomalous Hall effect in this material is anisotropic with the Néel vector orientation relative to the crystal structure and that this anisotropy requires high crystal quality and unlikely correlates with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

{"title": "Aqueous Laponite Dispersions are Attractive Gels, Not Repulsive Wigner Glasses: A Critical Commentary", "abstract": "An aqueous dispersion of Laponite has been studied in the literature for over the past three decades. Typically, the aqueous dispersion of Laponite undergoes incessant evolution of its microstructure, wherein its elastic modulus and the mean relaxation time show a continuous increase as a function of time. A considerable amount of discussion has revolved around the nature of this dispersion, specifically whether it can be classified as a repulsive Wigner glass state, characterized by disconnected Laponite particles stabilized by electrostatic repulsions, or an attractive gel state, in which the particles form a percolated space-spanning network. The proponents of the Wigner glass state also conjecture that this system experiences a glass-glass transition after a period of two days has elapsed since its preparation. In this commentary, we explore this topic from a rheological point of view analyzing the published literature and performing new experiments. Aided by additional evidence from the literature, we propose that rheological behavior overwhelmingly suggests that an aqueous dispersion of Laponite undergoes sol - attractive gel transition and remains in the attractive gel state over at least up to 7 days without undergoing any additional transition. Importantly, rheology, despite being a macroscopic tool governed by principles of mechanics, offers profound insight into the microstructure of this particular system.

At $T=2$ K and in $B=14$ T for both compounds, magnetoresistance reaches the order of magnitude of $10^4\\%$. For both materials, standard Kohler's rule is obeyed only in the temperature range from 50 K to 300 K. At lower temperatures, extended Kohler's rule has to be invoked because carrier concentrations and mobilities strongly change with temperature and magnetic field. This is further proven by the observation of a quite rare temperature-dependence of oscillation frequencies in Shubnikov-de Haas effect. Rate of this dependence clearly changes at Néel temperature, reminiscent of a novel magnetic band splitting. Multi-frequency character of the observed Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations points to the coexistence of electron- and hole-type Fermi pockets in both studied materials.

We find that if an impurity corresponds to varying a nonzero matrix element of the lattice Hamiltonian, regardless the element represents hopping, chemical potential, pairing, etc, then the average topological marker is conserved. However, if there are many strong impurities and the average distance between them is shorter than a correlation length, then the average marker is no longer conserved. In addition, strong and dense impurities can be used to continuously interpolate between one topological phase and another.

We find a critical phase dominated by phase fluctuations of a $Z_{6}$ nematic order parameter and bounded by two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, which displays only quasi-long-range nematic order. The electronic spectrum in the critical phase displays a thermal pseudogap-like behavior, whose properties depend on the anomalous critical exponent. We also show that an out-of-plane magnetic field induces nematic phase fluctuations that suppress the two BKT transitions via a mechanism analogous to the Hall viscoelastic response of the lattice, giving rise to a putative nematic quantum critical point with emergent continuous symmetry. Finally, we demonstrate that even in the case of an untwisted bilayer, a critical phase emerges when the nematic order parameter changes sign between the two layers, establishing an odd-parity nematic state.", "authors": "Virginia Gali, Matthias Hecker, Rafael M.

Interestingly, using the atomistic model developed by our group, it is clearly seen that different atoms are not switched together. In addition, our study reveals that the nature of switching is spatially nonuniform even in the small sample with the dimension of 20 nm-20 nm. Furthermore, the characteristics of nonuniformity are completely different for samples with different Gd composition (x). When x is close to the magnetization compensation point, successful switching cannot be obtained, but is accompanied by the stable oscillation. The atom type that dominates the oscillation is different from that predicted by the two-sublattice macrospin model.

Concomitantly, the proposed entropy allows for negative temperatures in systems with bounded spectra and closely matches canonical ensemble predictions.

The phonon bandstructure of a system with artificially raised Cs masses demonstrates an increased interference of the Cs rattling with the acoustic phonon modes. We show that the thermal conductivity of the CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite can still be slightly decreased by tuning the cation rattling frequency into the range of the low lying acoustic mode", "authors": "Jonathan Lahnsteiner, Max Rang, Menno Bokdam", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Intrinsic Spin Hall Effect in 5d Metals Calculated from Ab-Initio Transport Theory", "abstract": "We describe how the spin Hall effect (SHE) can be studied from ab-initio by combining density functional theory with the non-equilibrium Green's functions technique for quantum transport into the so-called DFT+NEGF method. After laying down our theoretical approach in particular discussing how to compute charge and spin bond currents, DFT+NEGF calculations are carried out for ideal clean systems. In these the transport is ballistic and the linear response limit is met. The SHE emerges in a central region attached to two leads when we apply a bias voltage so that electrons are accelerated by a uniform electric field. As a result, we obtain a finite spin-Hall current and, by performing a scaling analysis with respect to the system size, we estimate the ballistic spin Hall conductivity (SHC). We consider 5d metals with fcc and bcc crystal structures, finding that the SHC exhibits a rough qualitative dependence on the d-band filling, and comment on these results in relation to existing literature. Finally, within the same DFT+NEGF approach, we also predict the appearance of a current-induced spin dipole moment inside the materials' unit cell and estimate its magnitude.", "authors": "Akash Bajaj, Reena Gupta, Ilya V.

By systematically analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The structural optimizations have been carried out using the FP-LAPW (Full Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave) basis, as implemented in the ELK using tb-mBJ exchange correlation potential. Computed structural parameters are in good comparison with literature reports. Further, optimized crystal structures were used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric properties using pseudo potential based Quantum espresso code. Dynamical stability predicts material can withstand strain upto 10% strain. Computed electronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide bandgap ferromagnetic material with magnetic moment 1{\\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile strain the band gap increases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric properties predicts high Seebeck coefficient of ~ 400 {\\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity of ~ 1.13 X 1014 W/msK in LaBrI which results high ZT of ~ 1.92 with 8% strain at 800 K with p-type doping.

Parquet theory computes the two-body scattering amplitude, respecting its crossing symmetry. Phi derivability computes the nonequilibrium one-body dynamics, respecting conservation in the two-body response. Parquet cannot safeguard conservation and Phi derivability cannot guarantee crossing symmetry, yet both are physical requirements.

Our scaling analysis reveals that the model can undergo the continuous symmetry breaking even in $d=2$ and, moreover, predicts the upper critical dimension $d_{\\rm up}=2$. These results are fully consistent with a recent numerical simulation of the $O(2)$ model, where the authors reported a continuous symmetry breaking characterized by the mean-field critical exponents in $d=2$. For an example of the non-linear advection, we consider Toner and Tu model, which was introduced to explain the polar-ordered flocks observed, for instance, in the Vicsek model in $d=2$. Our simple scaling argument reproduces the previous results by the dynamical renormalization theory. We furthermore discuss the effects of the additional non-linear terms discovered by the recent re-analysis of the hydrodynamic equation of the polar-ordered flocks.

{"title": "Wave-Particle Duality of Ultrasound: Acoustic Softening Explained by Particle Treatment of Ultrasonic Wave", "abstract": "When ultrasonic wave is irradiated on materials, a small static stress is required to get materials yielding and flowing. This is called acoustic softening effect, also known as Blaha effect for a long time. In the past, this effect was explained by several continuum scale or meso-scale solid mechanics theories such as stress superposition or energy superposition theory, or crystal/dislocation plasticity. Due to a lot of microscopic complexities happening inside the materials during ultrasonic vibration, fully understanding of acoustic softening effect is not easy. In this paper, traditional solid mechanics theory is expanded by introducing several concepts in semi-conductor physics. Four new aspects were introduced to understand acoustic softening effect. Firstly, contrary to most existed work in acoustic softening research area which treats ultrasound as waves, it was treated as particles. Secondly, crystal/dislocation plastic theory was simplified to a single equation. Thirdly, concepts of photoelectric effect or photo-voltaic effect were introduced. Analogy of electron movement due to light wave and defect movement due to ultrasonic wave was illustrated. Particularly, as light wave is treated as photon, ultrasonic wave is treated as phonon in this paper. Fourthly, defects such as point defects or line defects are assumed to have certain bonding energy. Their bonding energies are assumed to be quantized or discontinuous. The band gap theory used in photo-voltaic theory is embraced to understand defects movements in solid mechanics due to ultrasonic phonon.", "authors": "Libin Yang, Lixiang Yang", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

We report the field-dependence of thermal conductivity in the well-characterized effective spin-1/2 paramagnetic insulator CsYbSe$_2$. Along with the data, we propose that the observed non-monotonic field dependence results from the hybridization of acoustic phonons with spin-flip excitations across the Zeeman gap, where the magnetoelastic coupling arises via modulation of the magnetic $g$-tensor by local strain. This hypothesis aligns with a simple theoretical model that qualitatively reproduces key features of the data on CsYbSe$_2$.

The phase diagram consists of the ferromagnetic phases, the paramagnetic phases, and the phase with weak magnetization (WM). By examining the nearest-neighbor transverse spin correlation, we probe that in the WM phase, the spins within a supercell generate a cluster with a small total spin, but between the nearest-neighbor supercells are distributed randomly. Especially for the dimerized limit case, the spins within a supercell tend to point to opposite directions of the transverse field. In addition, we also investigate the influence of the three-site interaction, and find that the WM phase is absent as the strength of the three-site interaction increases.

{"title": "Influence of Surface Roughness on Linear Behavior and Mechanical Properties of Three Cyanoacrylate-Based Adhesives Used to Bond Strain Gages", "abstract": "The challenge of accessing specialized adhesives designed for strain gage applications has been highlighted due to failures in logistic chains, requiring the exploration of local alternatives. A direct simulation of strain gage bonding behavior with two steel plates is infeasible due to the unique construction of strain gages. Therefore, an indirect simulation method, comparing local alternatives to a widely accepted adhesive, Loctite 496, was employed in this study. Two potential replacements, Loctite 401 and Tekbond 793, were tested and matched against the benchmark adhesive, with a focus on the key mechanical properties: Proportional Shear Strain (PSS), Proportional Shear Stress (PSSt), and Apparent Shear Modulus (G*). Loctite 401 exhibited the highest G*, suggesting its potential use in strain gage installations if G* is considered most important. However, Tekbond 793 demonstrated superior PSS, Maximum Shear Stress (MSSt), and Rupture Shear Stress (RSSt) performance, displaying linear behavior even without an accelerator. Surface preparation considerations were also discussed, noting that hand abrading results in double the surface roughness than using an orbital sander. The study further identified two main regions concerning failure modes related to Ra, with values below 0.31 {\\mu}m causing significant variations in observed mechanical properties, pointing towards factors beyond adhesive layer thickness affecting bond properties. Lastly, the general recommendation is the use of an accelerator for all tested adhesives, while the use of a surface conditioner and neutralizer was found to negatively impact adhesive performance.", "authors": "L.

{"title": "Approaching the forbidden phase transition in the Ising model, III: Hidden frustration, continuous marginal phase transition, and the minimal model", "abstract": "The laws that govern the nature often set certain limits or bans. Approaching those limits is a common paradigm of breakthroughs in human knowledge and technological application, such as time slowing to a stop as one approaches the speed of light, electrons flowing freely with no resistance as one approaches the absolute zero, and an event horizon arising as one approaches a black hole. A well-known ban concerning the statistical mechanics of cooperative phenomena, such as ice melting into water, is the nonexistence of phase transition at finite temperature in the Ising model with short-range interactions in one dimension. Yet, little is known about whether this forbidden transition could be approached arbitrarily closely at fixed finite temperature. To explore such asymptoticity, the notion of marginal phase transition (MPT) was introduced recently, and both the spontaneous MPT and the field-induced MPT were discovered respectively in ladder and single-chain Ising models decorated with geometric frustration. Here I push the limit down to the minimal single-chain Ising model -- without geometric frustration -- in a magnetic field; then, a hidden frustration is revealed to drive the first-order MPT with large latent heat. Furthermore, as one approaches the zero field, MPT appears continuous with no latent heat, displays abrupt change in sublattice magnetization and a kink-like minimum in overall magnetization with temperature, and vanishes when the field drops below a threshold. These findings deepen our understanding of cooperative phenomena via the doubly forbidden and open new avenues to the design and engineering of the Ising systems with the different types of MPT for exploring exotic phenomena and low-dimensional device applications.", "authors": "Weiguo Yin", "date": " 1 Jan 2024"},

Quantum chaos can be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using the spectral form factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function. When the system is small, the dip reaches values that are large enough at times which are short enough to be detected with current experimental platforms and commercially available quantum computers.", "authors": "Adway Kumar Das, Patrick Pinney, David A.

Whereas using plasmonic nanoparticles in biotesting has become routine, applications of plasmonics in energy are still early in development. Here, we investigate hot electron (HE) generation and related electromagnetic effects in both mono- and bi-metallic nanorods (NRs) and focus on one promising type of bi-metallic nanocrystals - core-shell Au-Ag nanorods. The spectra of the NRs are broadband, highly tunable with their geometry, and have few plasmon resonances. In this work, we provide a new quantum formalism describing the HE generation in bi-metallic nanostructures. Interestingly, we observe that the HE generation rate at the UV plasmon resonance of Au-Ag NRs appears to be very high. These HEs are highly energetic and suitable for carbon-fuel reactions. Simultaneously, the HE generation at the longitudinal plasmon (L-plasmon) peaks, which can be tuned from the yellow to near-IR, depends on the near-field and electromagnetic Mie effects, limiting the HE efficiencies for the long and large NRs. These properties of the L-plasmon relate to all kinds of NRs (Au, Ag, and Au-Ag). We also consider the generation of the interband d-holes in Au and Ag, since the involvement of the d-band is crucial for the energetic properties of UV plasmons.

The collective excitation spectrum, using Bogoliubov-de-Gennes theory, reveals the existence of a diverse range of phases in the SO and Rabi ($k_L-\\Omega$) coupling plane. Based on eigenvalue of the excitation spectrum, we categorize the $k_L-\\Omega$ plane into three distinct regions. In region I, a stable mode with phonon-like excitations is observed. In region IIa, single and multi-band instabilities are noted with a gapped mode, while multi-band instability accompanied by a gapless mode between low-lying and first excited states is realized in region IIb, which also provides evidence of unstable avoided crossing between low-lying and first excited modes The gap between low-lying and first-excited states increases upon increasing the Rabi coupling while decreases upon increase of SO coupling. Using eigenvector analysis, we confirm the presence of the spin-dipole mode in the spin-like modes in Region II. We corroborate the nature of the collective excitation through real-time dynamical evolution of the ground state perturbed with the quench of the trap using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii model. This analysis suggests the presence of dynamical instability leading to the disappearance of the $0$-th component of the condensate. In Region III, mainly encompassing $\\Omega \\sim 0$ and finite $k_L$, we observe phonon-like excitations in both the first excited and the low-lying state. The eigenvectors in this region reveal alternative in- and out-of-phase behaviours of the spin components.

Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time.

However, in designing new unknown novel materials there is no data to fit the parameters and therefore self-consistent determination of these parameters is crucial. In this work, using the new method formulated by others, which is based on density-functional perturbation theory, we have calculated self-consistently the Hubbard parameters for UO$_2$ crystal within different popular exchange-correlation approximations.

{"title": "Optical tweezer generation using automated alignment and adaptive optics", "abstract": "Recent progress in quantum technologies with ultracold atoms has been propelled by spatially fine-tuned control of lasers and diffraction-limited imaging. The state-of-the-art precision of optical alignment to achieve this fine-tuning is reaching the limits of manual control. Here, we show how to automate this process. One of the elementary techniques of manual alignment of optics is cross-walking of laser beams. Here, we generalize this technique to multi-variable cross-walking. Mathematically, this is a variant of the well-known Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm in convex optimization and is closely related to the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Therefore, we refer to our multi-variable cross-walking algorithm as the modified AM algorithm. While cross-walking more than two variables manually is challenging, one can do this easily for machine-controlled variables. We apply this algorithm to mechanically align high numerical aperture (NA) objectives and show that we can produce high-quality diffraction-limited tweezers and point spread functions (PSF). After a rudimentary coarse alignment, the algorithm takes about 1 hour to align the optics to produce high-quality tweezers. Moreover, we use the same algorithm to optimize the shape of a deformable mirror along with the mechanical variables and show that it can be used to correct for optical aberrations produced, for example, by glass thickness when producing tweezers and imaging point sources. The shape of the deformable mirror is parametrized using the first 14 non-trivial Zernike polynomials, and the corresponding coefficients are optimized together with the mechanical alignment variables. We show PSF with a Strehl ratio close to 1 and tweezers with a Strehl ratio >0.8. The algorithm demonstrates exceptional robustness, effectively operating in the presence of significant mechanical fluctuations induced by a noisy environment.", "authors": "Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana, Karatzyna Krzyzanowska, Malcolm Boshier", "date": " 20 Dec 2023"},

Under high magnetic fields there are high electro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large screening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design of these magnets is not straightforward. In addition, many contemporary designs use insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the displacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a large number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an an-isotropic bulk hollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in literature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following configuration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and we calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the MEMEP model. As a case study, 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet, is taken and simulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet by including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike previous work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused. Effect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated and compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field strongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The latter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations. Additionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of different material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly reduces the mechanical stresses.

Thus, stochastic equations are derived that exactly describe the dynamics of $\\lambda$'s. We consider two regimes: in the presence of an extra dephasing term, which can be generated by imperfect quantum measurements, the density matrix has a stationary distribution, and we show that in the limit of large sizes the distribution of $\\lambda$'s is described by an inverse Marchenko Pastur distribution. In the case of perfect measurements instead, purification eventually occurs and we focus on finite-time dynamics. In this case, remarkably, we find an exact solution for the joint probability distribution of $\\lambda$'s at each time $t$ and for each size $n$. Two relevant regimes emerge: at small times $t\\Gamma= O(1)$, the spectrum is in a Coulomb gas regime, with a well-defined continuous spectral distribution in the limit of $n\\to\\infty$.

Here we study the spin dynamics of a ferromagnetic Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model at finite temperature, and propose a mechanism of magnon damping that explains the intriguing experimental results.

We investigated twinning in FCC crystals to illustrate the methodology, and predicted the CRSS of twinning under different variables such as temperature and strain rate, both of which were in excellent agreement with experimental and other theory results.

Starting from a Penrose Hubbard model, our microscopic studies suggest that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism driven SC in the QC is usually gapless due to violation of Anderson's theorem, rendering that both chiral and nematic SCs are common. The nematic SC in the QC can support novel vestigial phases driven by pairing phase fluctuations above its $T_c$. Our combined renormalization group and Monte-Carlo studies provide a phase diagram in which, besides the conventional charge-4e SC, two critical vestigial phases emerge, i.e. the quasi-nematic (Q-N) SC and Q-N metal. In the two Q-N phases, the discrete lattice rotation symmetry is counter-intuitively ``quasi-broken'' with power-law decaying orientation correlations. They separate the phase diagram into various phases connected via Brezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. These remarkable critical vestigial phases, which resemble the intermediate BKT phase in the $q$-state ($q\\ge 5$) clock model, are consequence of the five- (or higher-) fold anisotropy field brought about by the unique QC symmetry, which are absent in conventional crystalline materials.", "authors": "Yu-Bo Liu, Jing Zhou, Fan Yang", "date": " 1 Jan 2024 ("},

Here, we present a first principles calculation of the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of various sized N-BPRs (N indicates the width). The electrocatalytic performance is evaluated based on several descriptors including electronic property, carrier mobility, Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta$G$_{HER}$), exchange current density etc. The electronic properties are crucially sensitive to the width (N) of BPRs transiting it from semiconducting to metallic nature at N=18. The p$_z$ orbitals of C-atoms from the central tetragonal rings are mainly responsible for the decrease in band gap with increasing width. The room temperature electron mobility is found to be as high as $\\sim6.3\\times$10$^4$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, while hole mobility is relatively lower in magnitude. Gibbs free energy also depends sensitively on the width of BPRs as evident from the p-band center analysis.

Here, we demonstrate an effective strategy to modulate the thermal transport property of hybrid perovskites by halide alloying. A highly tunable thermal conductivity of mixed-halide hybrid perovskites is achieved due to halide-alloying and structural distortion. Our experimental measurements show that the room temperature thermal conductivity of MAPb(BrxI1-x)3 (x = 0-1) can be largely modulated from 0.27 W/mK (x = 0.5) to 0.47 W/mK (x = 1). Molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that the thermal conductivity reduction of hybrid halide perovskites results from the suppression of the mean free paths of the low-frequency acoustic and optical phonons. It is found that halide alloying and the induced structural distortion can largely increase the scatterings of optical and acoustic phonons, respectively. The confined diffusion of MA+ cations in the octahedra cage is found to act as an additional thermal transport channel in hybrid perovskites and can contribute around 10-20% of the total thermal conductivity.

With the aid of the positron annihilation-induced Auger electron spectroscopy (PAES) performed simultaneously with DBS, we show that measurable differences between the Doppler broadened gamma spectra from Au and Cu surfaces in the high energy region of the gamma spectra can be used for the quantification of surface chemical composition. Modeling the measured Doppler spectra from clean Au and Cu surfaces using gamma spectra obtained from ab initio calculations after considering the detector energy resolution and surface positronium formation pointed to an increase in the relative contribution of gamma from positron annihilation with valence shell electrons. The fit result also suggests that the surface-trapped positrons predominantly annihilated with the delocalized valence shell (s and p) electrons that extended into the vacuum as compared to the highly localized d electrons. Simultaneous DBS and PAES measurements from adsorbate (sulfur, oxygen, carbon) or thin film (selenium (Se), graphene) covered Cu surface showed that it is possible to distinguish and quantify the surface adsorbate and thin-film composition just based on DBS.

In particular, we study four fillings: one-quarter, three-quarters, slightly above half filling (half filling plus two electrons), and slightly below half-filling (half filling minus two electrons). Incorporating interaction within the Hubbard model and using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method to find the ground states, we find that the spin-spin correlation is ferromagnetic at fillings less than half, similar to that observed at half filling, but is antiferromagnetic beyond half filling. Interestingly, these results hold only when mixing between the lowest quasiflat band and the next-to-lowest dispersive band is negligible; once mixing between the two bands is facilitated by increasing the interaction strength, the correlation becomes ferromagnetic above half filling as well. Additionally, by reducing the strength of the interaction in comparison to the bandwidth, a transition from the ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is observed in all the cases.", "authors": "Paban Kumar Patra, Yixuan Huang, Hridis K.

The effective tunability of spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) in bulk and at the interfaces of hybrid materials stacking is a prerequisite for scaling down the dimension and power consumption of these devices. In this work, we demonstrate the strong chemisorption of C60 molecules when grown on the high SOC $\\beta$-W layer. The parent CFB/$\\beta$-W bilayer exhibits large spin-to-charge interconversion efficiency, which can be ascribed to the interfacial SOC observed at the Ferromagnet/Heavy metal interface. Further, the adsorption of C60 molecules on $\\beta$-W reduces the effective Gilbert damping by $\\sim$15% in the CFB/$\\beta$-W/C60 heterostructures. The anti-damping is accompanied by a gigantic $\\sim$115% enhancement in the spin-pumping induced output voltage owing to the molecular hybridization. The non-collinear Density Functional Theory calculations confirm the long-range enhancement of SOC of $\\beta$-W upon the chemisorption of C60 molecules, which in turn can also enhance the SOC at the CFB/$\\beta$-W interface in CFB/$\\beta$-W/C60 heterostructures. The combined amplification of bulk as well interfacial SOC upon molecular hybridization stabilizes the anti-damping and enhanced spin-to-charge conversion, which can pave the way for the fabrication of power efficient spintronics devices.", "authors": "Antarjami Sahoo, Aritra Mukhopadhyaya, Swayang Priya Mahanta, Md.

{"title": "Magnetic order and strongly-correlated effects in the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice", "abstract": "We investigate the magnetic order and related strongly-correlated effects in an one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice with transverse field. This model is the anisotropic limit of the conventional isotropic Kondo lattice model, in the sense that the itinerant electrons interact with the localized magnetic moments via only longitudinal Kondo exchange. Adopting the numerical density-matrix-renormalization group method, we map out the ground-state phase diagram in various parameter spaces. Depending on the Kondo coupling and filling number, three distinct phases, including a metallic paramagnetic, a metallic ferromagnetic, and a gapped spin-density wave phase, are obtained. The spin-density wave is characterized by an ordering wave vector which coincides with the nesting wave vector of the Fermi surface. This makes the corresponding magnetic transition a spin analog of the Peierls transition occurring in the one-dimensional metal. Moreover, by analyzing the momentum distribution function and charge correlation function, the conduction electrons are shown to behave like free spinless fermions in the ferromagnetic phase. We finally discuss the effect of the repulsive Hubbard interaction between conduction electrons. Our work enriches the Kondo physics and deepens the current understanding of the heavy fermion compounds.", "authors": "Xiaofan Zhou, Jingtao Fan, Suotang Jia", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Higher-Order Cellular Automata Generated Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases and Detection Through Multi-Point Strange Correlators", "abstract": "Higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) are a type of cellular automata that evolve over multiple time steps. These HOCA generate intricate patterns within the spacetime lattice, which can be utilized to create symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. The symmetries of these phases are not global, but act on lower-dimensional subsystems of the lattice, such as lines or fractals. These are referred to as HOCA generated SPT (HGSPT) phases. These phases naturally encompass previously studied phases with subsystem symmetries, including symmetry-protected topological phases protected by symmetries supported on regular (e.g., line-like, membrane-like) and fractal subsystems. Moreover, these phases include models with subsystem symmetries that extend beyond previously studied phases. They include mixed-subsystem SPT (MSPT) that possess two types of subsystem symmetries simultaneously (for example, fractal and line-like subsystem symmetries or two different fractal symmetries), and chaotic SPT (CSPT) that have chaos-like symmetries, beyond the classification of fractal or regular subsystems. We propose that each HOCA pattern with a finite initial condition can be represented by a mathematical object $X=(d,M)$, and HOCA rules $\\mathbf{f}$ can be categorized into different classes $[\\mathbf{f}]$ based on the pattern that the rule can generate. The class of the HOCA rule of a given HGSPT can be identified by what we dub as the multi-point strange correlator, as a generalization of the strange correlator.

The impact of bending-induced strain on flexible films is studied quite well. However, little is known about the effect of other modes of flexibility, e.g., wrinkling, twisting, peeling, and stretching on the functional properties of flexible films. In this context, perpendicular magnetic anisotropic Co/Pt and Co/Pd thin films are prepared on flexible Kapton substrates, and the impact of the peeling mode is studied in detail. The peeling method generates numerous cracks, and buckling in the thin film, along with localized blister formation imaged by scanning electron microscopy. Further, the resistivity measurement confirms a significant enhancement in sample resistance owing to the severe damage of the films. The structural discontinuities strongly affect the magnetization reversal phenomena as measured by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE)-based microscopy. The bubble domains got converted to elongated-shaped domains due to several hindrances to the wall motion after strain application. Further, the relaxation measurements reveal that the thermal energy is insufficient to switch the magnetization at a few areas due to their high pinning potential associated with the damages. In contrast to bending-induced strain, here, all the modifications in the functional properties are found to be irreversible in nature.", "authors": "Esita Pandey, Shaktiranjan Mohanty, Abhisek Mishra, Bhuvneshwari Sharma, Subhankar Bedanta", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},

Inspired by recent experiments on integer or fractional quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH/FQAH) states in MoTe2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene, this work examines the archetypal correlated flat band model on a checkerboard lattice at filling {\\nu} = 2/3. Interestingly, at this filling level, we find that this topological flatband does not stabilize conventional FQAH states. Instead, the unique interplay between smectic charge order and topological order gives rise to two intriguing quantum states. As the interaction strength increases, the system first transitions from a Fermi liquid into FQAH smectic (FQAHS) states, where FQAH topological order coexists cooperatively with smectic charge order. With a further increase in interaction strength, the system undergoes another quantum phase transition and evolves into a polar smectic metal. Contrary to conventional smectic order and FQAHS states, this gapless state spontaneously breaks the two-fold rotational symmetry, resulting in a nonzero electric dipole moment and ferroelectric order. In addition to identifying the ground states, large-scale numerical simulations are also used to study low-energy excitations and thermodynamic characteristics. We find that FQAHS states exhibit two distinct temperature scales: the onset of charge order and the onset of the fractional Hall plateau, respectively. Interestingly, the latter is dictated by charge-neutral low-energy excitations with finite momenta, known as magnetorotons. Our studies suggest that these nontrivial phenomena could, in principle, be accessed in future experiments with moiré systems.", "authors": "Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Kai Sun, Zi Yang Meng", "date": " 31 Dec 2023 ("},
{"title": "Magnon, doublon and quarton excitations in 2D trimerized Heisenberg models", "abstract": "We investigate the magnetic excitations of the trimerized Heisenberg models with intra-trimer interaction $J_1$ and inter-trimer interaction $J_2$ on four different two-dimensional lattices using a combination of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation methods (SAC), complemented by cluster perturbation theory (CPT). These models exhibit quasi-particle-like excitations when $g=J_2/J_1$ is small, characterized by low-energy magnons, intermediate-energy doublons, and high-energy quartons. The low-energy magnons are associated with the magnetic ground states. They can be described by the linear spin wave theory (LSWT) of the effective block spin model and the original spin model. Doublons and quartons emerge from the corresponding internal excitations of the trimers with distinct energy levels, which can be effectively analyzed using perturbation theory when the ratio of exchange interactions $g$ is small. In this small $g$ regime, we observe a clear separation between the magnon and higher-energy spectra. However, as $g$ increases, these three spectra gradually merge into the magnon modes or continua. Nevertheless, the LSWT fails to provide quantitative descriptions of the higher-energy excitation bands due to significant quantum fluctuations. Notably, in the Collinear II and trimerized hexagon lattice, a broad continuum emerges above the single-magnon spectrum, originating from the quasi-1D physics due to the dilute connections between chains. Our numerical analysis of these 2D trimers yields valuable theoretical predictions and explanations for the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra of 2D magnetic materials featuring trimerized lattices.", "authors": "Yue-Yue Chang, Jun-Qing Cheng, Hui Shao, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},

In the clean limit, the dynamics of the order parameter for short times, characterized by a fast exponential growth and an oscillatory pattern, agrees with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) prediction. However, unlike BCS, we observe for longer times an universal exponential decay of these time oscillations that we show explicitly to be induced by the full emergence of spatial inhomogeneities of the order parameter, even in the clean limit, characterized by the exponential growth of its variance. The addition of a weak disorder does not alter these results qualitatively. In this region, the spatial inhomogeneities rapidly develops into an intricate spatial structure consisting of ordered fragmented stripes in perpendicular directions where the order parameter is heavily suppressed especially in the central region. As the disorder strength increases, the fragmented stripes gradually turn into a square lattice of approximately circular spatial regions where the condensate is heavily suppressed. A further increase of disorder leads to the deformation and ultimate destruction of this lattice. We explore suitable settings for the experimental confirmation of these findings.", "authors": "Bo Fan, Antonio M. García-García", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Effect of nuclear reactions rates and core boundary mixing on the seismology of red clump stars", "abstract": "Modeling of the stars in the red clump (RC) is challenging, due to the uncertainties associated with the physical processes happening in their core and during the helium flash. By probing the internal stellar structure, asteroseismology allows us to constrain the core properties of RC stars and eventually improve our understanding of this evolutionary phase. In this work, we aim to quantify the impact on the seismic properties of the RC stars of the two main core modeling uncertainties: core boundary mixing, and helium burning nuclear reaction rates. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we compute models with different core boundary mixing as well as different $3\\alpha$ and carbon alpha (C-alpha) nuclear reaction rates. We investigate the impact of those parameters on the period spacing $\\Delta \\Pi$, which is a probe of the region around the core. We find that different core boundary mixing schemes yield significantly different period spacings, with differences of 30s between the maximal $\\Delta \\Pi$ value computed with semiconvection and maximal overshoot. We show that increasing the rate of the C-alpha reaction lengthens the core helium burning phase, which extends the range of $\\Delta \\Pi$ covered by the models during their evolution. This results in a difference of 10s between the models computed with a nominal rate and a rate multiplied by 2, which is larger than the observational uncertainties. The effect of changing the 3$\\alpha$ reaction rate is comparatively small. In conclusion, the core boundary mixing is the main source of uncertainty regarding the seismic modeling of RC stars. Moreover, the effect of the C-alpha reaction rate is non-negligible, even if difficult to disentangle from the effect of the mixing. Such degeneracy could be raised in the future, thanks to new seismic data from the PLATO mission and theoretical constraints from numerical simulations.", "authors": "Anthony Noll, Sarbani Basu, Saskia Hekker", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A solution for the density dichotomy problem of Kuiper Belt objects with multi-species streaming instability and pebble accretion", "abstract": "Kuiper belt objects show an unexpected trend, whereby large bodies have increasingly higher densities, up to five times greater than their smaller counterparts. Current explanations for this trend assume formation at constant composition, with the increasing density resulting from gravitational compaction. However, this scenario poses a timing problem to avoid early melting by decay of $^{26}$Al. We aim to explain the density trend in the context of streaming instability and pebble accretion. Small pebbles experience lofting into the atmosphere of the disk, being exposed to UV and partially losing their ice via desorption. Conversely, larger pebbles are shielded and remain more icy. We use a shearing box model including gas and solids, the latter split into ices and silicate pebbles. Self-gravity is included, allowing dense clumps to collapse into planetesimals. We find that the streaming instability leads to the formation of mostly icy planetesimals, albeit with an unexpected trend that the lighter ones are more silicate-rich than the heavier ones. We feed the resulting planetesimals into a pebble accretion integrator with a continuous size distribution, finding that they undergo drastic changes in composition as they preferentially accrete silicate pebbles. The density and masses of large KBOs are best reproduced if they form between 15 and 22\\,AU. Our solution avoids the timing problem because the first planetesimals are primarily icy, and $^{26}$Al is mostly incorporated in the slow phase of silicate pebble accretion.

The latest formulation of internal magnetic fields based on the Tayler instability is indeed able to reproduce the internal rotation rate of post-main sequence stars, however, it appears too efficient during the main sequence and has thus been disfavoured. A less efficient version of the same transport process can simultaneously reproduce the rotation rate of the convective core, the rotation rate in radiative regions as probed by gravity-modes, and the surface rotational velocities of $\\gamma$ Doradus stars.

{"title": "A radius valley between migrated steam worlds and evaporated rocky cores", "abstract": "The radius valley (or gap) in the observed distribution of exoplanet radii, which separates smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes, is a key feature that theoretical models must explain. Conventionally, it is interpreted as the result of the loss of primordial H/He envelopes atop rocky cores. However, planet formation models predict that water-rich planets migrate from regions outside the snowline toward the star. Assuming water to be in the form of solid ice in their interior, many of these planets would be located in the radius gap, in disagreement with observations. Here we use an advanced coupled formation and evolution model that describes the planets' origin and evolution starting from moon-sized, planetary seed embryos in the protoplanetary disk to mature Gyr-old planetary systems. Employing new equations of state and interior structure models to treat water as vapor mixed with H/He, we naturally reproduce the valley at the observed location. The model results indicate that the valley separates less massive, in-situ, rocky super-Earths from more massive, ex-situ, water-rich sub-Neptunes. Furthermore, the occurrence drop at larger radii, the so-called radius cliff, is also matched by planets with water-dominated envelopes. Owing to our statistical approach, we can assess that the synthetic distribution of radii quantitatively agrees with observations for the close-in population of planets; but only if atmospheric photoevaporation is also acting, populating the super-Earth peak with evaporated rocky cores. Therefore, we provide a hybrid theoretical explanation of the radius gap and cliff caused by both formation (orbital migration) as well as evolution (atmospheric escape).", "authors": "Remo Burn, Christoph Mordasini, Lokesh Mishra, Jonas Haldemann, Julia Venturini, Alexandre Emsenhuber, Thomas Henning", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

The use of extremely low radio frequency observations, such as LOFAR at 53 and 144 MHz, allowed us to detect the extension of the tails up to a distance of ~ 1 Mpc. We extracted spectral profiles along the tails in order to identify possible departures from a pure ageing model, such as the Jaffe-Perola (JP) model, which only involves synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses. We found clear evidence of departures from this simple ageing model, such as surface brightness enhancement and spectral flattening along all of the tails. This can be interpreted as the consequence of particle re-acceleration along the tails. Possible explanations for this behaviour include the interaction between a shock and the radio tails or a turbulence-driven re-acceleration mechanism.

However, the quadrupole of the gravitational field of the Solar System (SS) provides a strong constraint on the way in which Newtonian gravity can be modified. In this paper we assess the extent to which modified gravity formulations of MOND are capable of accounting simultaneously for the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) -- encapsulating late-type galaxy dynamics -- the Cassini measurement of the SS quadrupole and the kinematics of wide binaries in the Solar neighbourhood. We achieve this by extending the method of Desmond (2023) to infer the location and sharpness of the MOND transition from the SPARC RAR under broad assumptions for the behaviour of the interpolating function and external field effect. We constrain the same quantities from the SS quadrupole, finding that it requires a significantly sharper transition between the deep-MOND and Newtonian regimes than is allowed by the RAR (an 8.7$\\sigma$ tension under fiducial model assumptions). This may be relieved by allowing additional freedom in galaxies' mass-to-light ratios -- which also provides a better RAR fit -- and more significantly by removing galaxies with bulges.

With our astrometric measurements, we determined an improved orbit of the comet, based upon which we derived that the comet is dynamically new and that its perihelion distance will further shrink due to the Galactic tide.

{"title": "Development and validation of a cryogenic far-infrared diffraction grating spectrometer used to post-disperse the output from a Fourier transform spectrometer", "abstract": "Recent advances in far-infrared detector technology have led to increases in raw sensitivity of more than an order of magnitude over previous state-of-the-art detectors. With such sensitivity, photon noise becomes the dominant noise component, even when using cryogenically cooled optics, unless a method of restricting the spectral bandpass is employed. The leading instrument concept features reflecting diffraction gratings which post-disperse the light that has been modulated by a polarizing Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) onto a detector array, thereby reducing the photon noise on each detector. This paper discusses the development of a cryogenic (4 K) diffraction grating spectrometer which operates over the wavelength range from \\SIrange{285}{500}{\\micro \\meter} and was used to post-disperse the output from a room-temperature polarizing FTS. Measurements of the grating spectral response and diffraction efficiency are presented as a function of both wavelength and polarization to characterize the instrumental performance.", "authors": "Alicia M.

{"title": "Time Series of Magnetic Field Parameters of Merged MDI and HMI Space-Weather Active Region Patches as Potential Tool for Solar Flare Forecasting", "abstract": "Solar flare prediction studies have been recently conducted with the use of Space-Weather MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) Active Region Patches (SMARP) and Space-Weather HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory) Active Region Patches (SHARP), which are two currently available data products containing magnetic field characteristics of solar active regions. The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP with SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI-HMI dataset currently spans the period between April 4, 1996, and December 13, 2022, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Time-lagged cross-correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of active regions lead the flare index in time. Applying the rolling window technique makes it possible to see how this leader-follower dynamic varies with time. Preliminary results indicate that areas of high correlation generally correspond to increased flare activity during the peak solar cycle.", "authors": "Paul A. Kosovich, Viacheslav M.

{"title": "Effects on neutrino propagation in space-time foam of D-branes revisited", "abstract": "Neutrinos from the cosmos have proven to be ideal for probing the nature of space-time. Previous studies on high-energy events of IceCube suggested that some of these events might be gamma-ray burst neutrinos, with their speeds varying linearly with their energy, implying also the coexistence of subluminal and superluminal propagation. However, a recent reanalysis of the data, incorporating revised directional information, reveals stronger signals that neutrinos are actually being slowed down compared to previous suggestion of neutrino speed variation. Thus, it is worth discussing its implications for the brane/string inspired framework of space-time foam, which has been used to explain previous observations. We revisit effects on neutrino propagation from specific foam models within the framework, indicating that the implied violation of Lorentz invariance could necessarily cause the neutrino to decelerate. We therefore argue that this sort of model is in agreement with the updated phenomenological indication just mentioned. An extended analysis of the revised IceCube data will further test these observations and stringy quantum gravity.", "authors": "Chengyi Li, Bo-Qiang Ma", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Properties, age, and origin of a huge meteor cluster observed over Scandinavia on 30 October 2022", "abstract": "A meteor outburst consisting of at least 22 meteors above the Baltic sea and southern Scandinavia that occurred on 30 October 2022 was recorded using multiple cameras. A bright fireball was followed by fainter meteors over a 10 second period. All the meteors were travelling on parallel trajectories. The goal of this study is to determine the atmospheric trajectories and photometric masses of meteors and to use these data to determine the specifics of the progenitor meteoroid break-up and cluster formation. Double and triple-station observations using video cameras were used for the calculation of the atmospheric trajectories and photometric masses of the meteors. Their relative positions and mass distribution were then used to determine the time and cause of the meteoroid fragmentation. The relative position of the cluster particles in the atmosphere and the distribution of their masses best correspond to the separation of the smaller fragments from the mass-dominant fragment 10.6$\\pm$1.7 days before the collision with Earth, assuming a meteoroid bulk density of 1000 kg.m$^{-3}$.

{"title": "Possible Dark Matter Signals from White Dwarfs", "abstract": "In our galaxy, the white dwarfs (WDs) will inevitably capture the dark matter (DM) particles streaming through them, if there exist interactions between DM particles and nucleons/electrons. At the same time, these DM particles can also be evaporated by the nucleons/electrons in a WD if they have proper mass. The evaporation of DM particles will lead to a faster cooling evolution than that predicted by stellar evolution theory.

The terrestrial data spans from bulk properties of finite nuclei to the heavy-ion collisions which constrain the symmetric nuclear matter EoS and the symmetry energy up to twice the saturation density ($\\rho_0$= 0.16 fm$^{-3}$). The astrophysical observations encompass the NS radius, the tidal deformability, and the lower bound on maximum mass.

We compare these sets using the Kullback-Liebler divergence. Our results for the Kullback-Liebler divergence highlight the significant constraints imposed on the EoSs by the currently available lower bound of neutron star maximum mass and terrestrial data.

Its work packages are outlined, covering specific tools, citizen contributions, standard and multi-colour observations, secondary eclipses, and reprocessing of archival photometry.

{"title": "Stability of Dusty Rings in Protoplanetary Discs", "abstract": "Dust rings in protoplanetary discs are often observed in thermal dust emission and could be favourable environments for planet formation. While dust rings readily form in gas pressure maxima, their long-term stability is key to both their observability and potential to assist in planet formation. We investigate the stability of the dust ring generated by interactions of a protoplanetary disc with a Neptune sized planet and consider its possible long term evolution using the FARGO3D Multifluid code. We look at the onset of the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) and compare how the addition of dust in a disc can alter the stability of the gas phase. We find that with the addition of dust, the rings generated by planet disc interactions are more prone to RWI and can cause the gas phase to become unstable. The instability is shown to occur more easily for higher Stokes number dust, as it accumulates into a more narrow ring which triggers the RWI, while the initial dust fraction plays a more minor role in the stability properties. We show that the dusty RWI generates vortices that collect dust in their cores, which could be sites for further planetesimal formation. We conclude that the addition of dust can cause a ring in a protoplanetary disc to become more prone to instability leading to a different long term evolution compared to gas only simulations of the RWI.", "authors": "Kevin Chan, Sijme-Jan Paardekooper", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

This work explores using an instrument model in post-processing to separate astrophysical signals from residual aberrations in coronagraphic data. The effect of wavefront error (WFE) on the coronagraphic intensity consists of a linear contribution and a quadratic contribution. When either of the terms is much larger than the other, the instrument response can be approximated by a transfer matrix mapping WFE to detector plane intensity. From this transfer matrix, a useful projection onto instrumental modes that removes the dominant error modes can be derived. We apply this projection to synthetically generated Roman Space Telescope hybrid Lyot coronagraph (HLC) data to extract \"robust observables,\" which can be used instead of raw data for applications such as detection testing. The projection improves planet flux ratio detection limits by about 28% in the linear regime and by over a factor of 2 in the quadratic regime, illustrating that robust observables can increase sensitivity to astrophysical signals and improve the scientific yield from coronagraphic data. While this approach does not require additional information such as observations of reference stars or modulations of a deformable mirror, it can and should be combined with these other techniques, acting as a model-informed prior in an overall post-processing strategy.", "authors": "Yinzi Xin, Laurent Pueyo, Romain Laugier, Leonid Pogorelyuk, Ewan S.

We focus on understanding the relationship between these spikes and the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Disentangling the complex interplay between IGM physics and the influence of galaxies on the generation of these spikes presents a significant challenge. To address this, we employ Explainable Boosting Machines, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, to quantify the relative impact of various IGM properties on the Ly$\\alpha$ flux. Our findings reveal that gas density is the primary factor influencing absorption strength, followed by the intensity of background radiation and the temperature of the IGM. Ionizing radiation from local sources (i.e. galaxies) appears to have a minimal effect on Ly$\\alpha$ flux. The simulations show that transmission spikes predominantly occur in regions of low gas density. Our results challenge recent observational studies suggesting the origin of these spikes in regions with enhanced radiation. We demonstrate that Ly$\\alpha$ transmission spikes are largely a product of the large-scale structure, of which galaxies are biased tracers.", "authors": "Hanjue Zhu, Nickolay Gnedin, Camille Avestruz", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

Ion thermal conduction and the absence of disc evaporation", "abstract": "We use local stratified shearing-box simulations with magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction to study an idealized model of the coupling between a cold, radiatively efficient accretion disc, and an overlying, hot, two-temperature corona. Evaporation of a cold disc by conduction from the hot corona has been proposed as a means of mediating the soft-to-hard state transitions observed in X-ray binary systems. We model the coronal plasma in our local disc patch as an MHD fluid subject to both free-streaming ion conduction and a parameterized cooling function that captures the collisional transfer of energy from hot ions to colder, rapidly cooling leptons. In all of our models, independent of the initial net vertical magnetic flux (NF) threading the disc, we find no evidence of disc evaporation. The ion heat flux into the disc is radiated away before conduction can heat the disc's surface layers. When an initial NF is present, steady-state temperature, density, and outflow velocities in our model coronae are unaffected by conduction. Instead of facilitating disc evaporation, thermal conduction is more likely to feed the disc with plasma condensing out of the corona, particularly in flows without NF. Our work indicates that uncertainties in the amount of NF threading the disc hold far greater influence over whether or not the disc will evaporate into a radiatively inefficient accretion flow compared to thermal conduction. We speculate that a change in net flux mediates disc truncation/evaporation.", "authors": "Christopher J. Bambic, Eliot Quataert, Matthew W. Kunz, Yan-Fei Jiang", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

The PDD structure is formed in a thick p-type substrate, to which high negative voltage is applied to make it fully depleted. A pinned p-well is introduced at the backside of the insulator layer to reduce a dark current generation at the Si-SiO$_{2}$ interface and to fix the back-gate voltage of the SOI transistors. An n-well is further introduced between the p-well and the substrate to make a potential barrier between them and suppress a leakage current. An optimization study on the n-well dopant concentration is necessary because a higher dopant concentration could result in a higher potential barrier but also in a larger sense-node capacitance leading to a lower spectroscopic performance, and vice versa. Based on a device simulation, we fabricated five candidate chips having different n-well dopant concentrations. We successfully found out the best n-well design, which suppressed a large leakage current and showed satisfactory X-ray spectroscopic performance. Too low and too high n-well dopant concentration chips showed a large leakage current and degraded X-ray spectroscopic performance, respectively.

These galaxies individually contain the largest samples of Cepheids, an average of >150 each, producing the strongest statistical comparison to those previously measured with the Hubble Space Telescope in the NIR. They also span the distance range of those used to determine the Hubble constant with HST, allowing us to search for a distance-dependent bias in HST measurements. The superior resolution of JWST negates crowding noise, the largest source of variance in the NIR Cepheid Period-Luminosity relations (Leavitt laws) measured with HST. Together with the use of two-epochs to constrain Cepheid phases and three filters to remove reddening, we reduce the dispersion in the Cepheid PL relations by a factor of 2.5. We find no significant difference in the mean distance measurements determined from HST and JWST, with a formal difference of -0.01+/-0.03 mag. This result is independent of zeropoints and analysis variants including metallicity dependence, local crowding, choice of filters, and relation slope. We can reject the hypothesis of unrecognized crowding of Cepheid photometry from HST that grows with distance as the cause of the ``Hubble Tension'' at 8.2 sigma, i.e., greater confidence than that of the Hubble Tension itself. We conclude that errors in photometric measurements of Cepheids across the distance ladder do not significantly contribute to the Tension.", "authors": "Adam G. Riess, Gagandeep S.

With a redshift of $z = 0.01107$ and a peak UV/optical luminosity of $(5.4\\pm0.4)\\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, ASASSN-23bd is the lowest-redshift and least-luminous TDE discovered to date. Spectroscopically, ASASSN-23bd shows H$\\alpha$ and He I emission throughout its spectral time series, and the UV spectrum shows nitrogen lines without the strong carbon and magnesium lines typically seen for AGN. Fits to the rising ASAS-SN light curve show that ASASSN-23bd started to brighten on MJD 59988$^{+1}_{-1}$, $\\sim$9 days before discovery, with a nearly linear rise in flux, peaking in the $g$ band on MJD $60000^{+3}_{-3}$. Scaling relations and TDE light curve modelling find a black hole mass of $\\sim$10$^6$ $M_\\odot$, which is on the lower end of supermassive black hole masses.

With the advent of JWST, there is great promise to utilize the technique to measure galaxy distances out to at least 50 Mpc, significantly further than HST's reach of 20 Mpc. However, with any standard candle, it is first necessary to provide an absolute reference. Here we use Cycle 1 data to provide an absolute calibration in the F090W filter. F090W is most similar to the F814W filter commonly used for TRGB measurements with HST, which had been adopted by the community due to minimal dependence from the underlying metallicities and ages of stars. The imaging we use was taken in the outskirts of NGC 4258, which has a direct geometrical distance measurement from the Keplerian motion of its water megamaser.

{"title": "A closer look at the electromagnetic signatures of Bethe-Heitler pair production process in blazars", "abstract": "The ''twin birth'' of a positron and an electron by a photon in the presence of a nucleus, known as Bethe-Heitler pair production, is a key process in astroparticle physics. The Bethe-Heitler process offers a way of channeling energy stored in a population of relativistic protons (or nuclei) to relativistic pairs with extended distributions. Contrary to accelerated leptons, whose maximum energy is limited by radiative losses, the maximal energy of pairs is determined by the kinematics of the process and can be as high as the parent proton energy. We take a closer look at the features of the injected pair distribution, and provide a novel empirical function that describes the spectrum of pairs produced by interactions of single-energy protons with single-energy photons. The function is the kernel of the Bethe-Heitler pair production spectrum that replaces a double numerical integration involving the complex differential cross section of the process, and can be easily implemented in numerical codes. We further examine under which conditions Bethe-Heitler pairs produced in blazar jets can emit $\\gamma$-ray photons via synchrotron radiation, thus providing an alternative to the inverse Compton scattering process for high-energy emission in jetted active galactic nuclei. After taking into consideration the broadband spectral characteristics of the source, the jet energetics, and the properties of radiation fields present in the blazar environment, we conclude that $\\gamma$-rays in low- and intermediate-peaked blazars may arise from Bethe-Heitler pairs in regions of the jet with typical transverse size $\\sim 10^{15}$ cm and co-moving magnetic field $5-500$ G.", "authors": "Despina Karavola, Maria Petropoulou", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Revisiting the Helium and Hydrogen Accretion Indicators at TWA 27B: Weak Mass Flow at Near-Freefall Velocity", "abstract": "TWA 27B (2M1207b) is the first directly-imaged planetary-mass (MP ~ 5 MJ) companion (Chauvin et al. 2004) and was observed at 0.9--5.3 micron with JWST/NIRSpec (Luhman et al. 2023). To understand the accretion properties of TWA 27B, we search for continuum-subtracted near-infrared helium and hydrogen emission lines and measure their widths and luminosities. We detect the He I triplet at 4.3 sigma and all Paschen-series lines covered by NIRSpec (Pa alpha, Pa beta, Pa gamma, Pa delta) at 4--5 sigma. The three brightest Brackett-series lines (Br alpha, Br beta, Br gamma) as well as Pf gamma and Pf delta are tentative detections at 2--3 sigma. We provide upper limits on the other hydrogen lines, including on H alpha through Hubble Space Telescope archival data. Three lines can be reliably deconvolved to reveal an intrinsic width Delta v = 67+-9 km/s, which is 60% of the surface freefall velocity. The line luminosities seem significantly too high to be due to chromospheric activity. Converting line luminosities to an accretion rate yields Mdot ~ 5e-9 MJ/yr when using scalings relationships for planetary masses, and Mdot ~ 0.1e-9 MJ/yr with extrapolated stellar scalings. Several of these lines represent first detections at an accretor of such low mass. The weak accretion rate implies that formation is likely over. This analysis shows that JWST can be used to measure low line-emitting mass accretion rates onto planetary-mass objects, motivates deeper searches for the mass reservoir feeding TWA 27B, and hints that other young directly-imaged objects might -- hitherto unbeknownst -- also be accreting.", "authors": "Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Yuhiko Aoyama, Jun Hashimoto, Yifan Zhou", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

These clumps of stars are readily apparent near $1.0< F150W-F277W <1.5$ and $m_{F150W}$=22-25 mag with \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} NIRCam photometry. Various methods have been proposed to assign an apparent reference magnitude for this recently proposed standard candle, including the mode, median, sigma-clipped mean or a modeled parameter of its luminosity function. We test the consistency of these by measuring intra-host variations, finding differences of up to $\\sim$0.2 mag that significantly exceed statistical uncertainties. Brightness differences appear intrinsic, and are further amplified by the non-uniform shape of the JAGB LF, an issue already apparent in comparing the LMC and SMC. We follow a ``many methods'' approach to consistently measure JAGB magnitudes and distances to the SN Ia host sample calibrated by NGC 4258. We find broad agreement with the distances measured from Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Miras. However, the SN host mean distance estimated via the JAGB method and necessary to estimate $H_0$, differs by $\\sim$ 0.18 mag amongst the above definitions, a result of the different levels of asymmetry of the JAGB luminosity functions.

{"title": "SPT: Spectral Transformer for Red Giant Stars Age and Mass Estimation", "abstract": "The age and mass of red giants are essential for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Traditional isochrone methods for these estimations are inherently limited due to overlapping isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, while asteroseismology, though more precise, requires high-precision, long-term observations. In response to these challenges, we developed a novel framework, Spectral Transformer (SPT), to predict the age and mass of red giants aligned with asteroseismology from their spectra. A key component of SPT, the Multi-head Hadamard Self-Attention mechanism, designed specifically for spectra, can capture complex relationships across different wavelength. Further, we introduced a Mahalanobis distance-based loss function to address scale imbalance and interaction mode loss, and incorporated Monte Carlo dropout for quantitative analysis of prediction uncertainty.Trained and tested on 3,880 red giant spectra from LAMOST, the SPT achieved remarkable age and mass estimations with average percentage errors of 17.64% and 6.61%, respectively, and provided uncertainties for each corresponding prediction. The results significantly outperform those of traditional machine learning algorithms and demonstrate a high level of consistency with asteroseismology methods and isochrone fitting techniques.

The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of RELXILL (modified to read the table of REFLIONX, which is the non-relativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that RELXILL with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk's ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated.

Explicit analytical solutions for spherical harmonic coefficients are presented and applied to various background spectra, alleviating computational effort. High l frequency spectra are led by higher order derivatives of the spectrum. Tabulated frequency spectra are computed with a relatively poor frequency resolution in comparison with the Doppler shift, calling for interpolation. They are affected by uncertainties due to intrinsic inaccuracies in modelling, observational data or limited computation accuracy, propagate and increase with the derivative order, possibly preventing a trustworthy computation to higher l and of the observed monopole. We filter the original function and the multipole spectra to derive reliable predictions of the harmonic coefficients. For spectra expressed in Taylor series, we derive explicit solutions for the harmonic coefficients up to l=6 in terms of spectra derivatives. We consider filters and study the quality of these methods on suitable analytical approximations, polluted with simulated noise. We consider the extragalactic sources microwave background from radio loud AGN and the 21cm line superimposed to the CMB. Gaussian pre-filtering coupled to a real space filtering of derivatives allows accurate predictions up to l=6, while log-log polynomial representation gives accurate solutions at any l. Describing the 21 cm model variety is difficult, so it is relevant to relax assumptions. Pre-filtering gives accurate predictions up to l=3-4, while further filtering or boosting amplification/deamplification method improves the results allowing reasonable estimations.

We investigate whether the deficit of molecular gas star formation efficiency (SFE$_{\\rm mol}$) that leads to the low specific star formation rate in these green valley galaxies is due to a lack of dense gas (characterized by the dense gas fraction $f_{\\rm dense}$) or the low star formation efficiency of dense gas (SFE$_{\\rm dense}$). We find that SFE$_{\\rm mol}$ as traced by the CO emissions, when considering both star-forming and retired spaxels together, is tightly correlated with SFE$_{\\rm dense}$ and depends only weakly on $f_{\\rm dense}$. The specific star formation rate (sSFR) on kpc scales is primarily driven by SFE$_{\\rm mol}$ and SFE$_{\\rm dense}$, followed by the dependence on $f_{\\rm mol}$, and is least correlated with $f_{\\rm dense}$ or the dense-to-stellar mass ratio ($R_{\\rm dense}$).

{"title": "Can the giant planets of the Solar System form via pebble accretion in a smooth protoplanetary disc?", "abstract": "Prevailing $N$-body planet formation models typically start with lunar-mass embryos and show a general trend of rapid migration of massive planetary cores to the inner Solar System in the absence of a migration trap. This setup cannot capture the evolution from a planetesimal to embryo, which is crucial to the final architecture of the system. We aim to model planet formation with planet migration starting with planetesimals of $\\sim10^{-6}$ -- $10^{-4}M_\\oplus$ and reproduce the giant planets of the Solar System. We simulated a population of 1,000 -- 5,000 planetesimals in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which was evolved under the effects of their mutual gravity, pebble accretion, gas accretion, and planet migration, employing the parallelized $N$-body code SyMBAp. We find that the dynamical interactions among growing planetesimals are vigorous and can halt pebble accretion for excited bodies. While a set of results without planet migration produces one to two gas giants and one to two ice giants beyond 6 au, massive planetary cores readily move to the inner Solar System once planet migration is in effect. Dynamical heating is important in a planetesimal disc and the reduced pebble encounter time should be considered in similar models. Planet migration remains a challenge to form cold giant planets in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which suggests an alternative mechanism is required to stop them at wide orbits.", "authors": "Tommy Chi Ho Lau, Man Hoi Lee, Ramon Brasser, Soko Matsumura", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

In this work, we use these observations for the main purpose of spectroscopic redshift measurements. For all sources except 0452-50, we confirm the previously reported most likely redshifts, and we find typical CO and OH$^+$ properties for massive starbursts. For 0452-50, we rule out the previously reported value of $z$=2.0105, measuring a firm redshift of $z$=5.0160 based on [OI], [CII], H$_2$O, and CO emission instead when adding in ancillary ALMA data. Previously, 0452-50 was considered an outlier in relations between dust temperature, far-infrared luminosity and redshift, which may have hinted at an unusually cold starburst with a dust temperature of only $T_{\\rm dust}$=(21$\\pm$2) K. Instead, our new measurements suggest it to be among highly luminous massive dusty starbursts at $z$$>$5, with rather typical properties within that population. We find a revised dust temperature of $T_{\\rm dust}$=(76.2$\\pm$2.5) K, and updated lensing-corrected far-infrared and infrared luminosities of (2.35$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$) and (4.07$^{+0.25}_{-0.27}$)$\\times$10$^{13}$ $L_\\odot$, respectively - i.e., about an order of magnitude higher than previously reported.

The peak absolute V-band magnitude of SN 2021gmj is -15.5 mag, which is fainter than that of normal Type IIP SNe. The spectral evolution of SN 2021gmj resembles that of other sub-luminous supernovae: the optical spectra show narrow P-Cygni profiles, indicating a low expansion velocity. We estimate the progenitor mass to be about 12 Msun from the nebular spectrum and the 56Ni mass to be about 0.02 Msun from the bolometric light curve. We also derive the explosion energy to be about 3 x 10^{50} erg by comparing numerical light curve models with the observed light curves. Polarization in the plateau phase is not very large, suggesting nearly spherical outer envelope. The early photometric observations capture the rapid rise of the light curve, which is likely due to the interaction with a circumstellar material (CSM). The broad emission feature formed by highly-ionized lines on top of a blue continuum in the earliest spectrum gives further indication of the CSM at the vicinity of the progenitor.

To investigate the various factors that may affect the prevalence of AGNs in cluster galaxies, we selected a sample of 19 thoroughly studied X-ray-selected galaxy clusters from the LoCuSS survey. All these clusters are considered massive, with $M_{500}\\gtrsim 2\\times10^{14} M_{solar}$, and span a narrow redshift range between $z\\sim$0.16 and 0.28. We divided the cluster surroundings into two concentric annuli with a width of $R_{500}$ radius. We further divided the cluster sample based on the presence of infalling X-ray-detected groups, cluster mass, or dynamical state. We found that the X-ray AGN fraction in the outskirts is consistent with the field, but it is significantly lower in cluster centres, in agreement with previous results for massive clusters. We show that these results do not depend on cluster mass. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence of a spatial correlation between infalling groups and AGNs. Nevertheless, a significant excess of X-ray AGNs is found in the outskirts of relaxed clusters at the 2$\\sigma$ confidence level, compared both to non-relaxed clusters and to the field. Our results suggest that the mechanisms that trigger AGN activity may vary between cluster centres and the outskirts. Ram pressure can efficiently remove the gas from infalling galaxies, thereby triggering AGN activity in some cases. However, the reduced availability of gas globally diminishes the fraction of AGNs in cluster centers. The surplus of X-ray AGNs identified in the outskirts of relaxed clusters may be attributed to an increased frequency of galaxy mergers, a notion that is further supported by the disturbed morphology observed in several galaxies.", "authors": "E.

However, the friction on the wall is not necessarily a monotonous function of the wall velocity and could have a maximum before it reaches the Bodeker-Moore limit. In this paper, we compare the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction, i.e., a frictional force in local thermal equilibrium that originates from inhomogeneous temperature distribution across the wall, and the Bodeker-Moore thermal friction. We study the former in a fully analytical way, clarifying its physical origin and providing a simple expression for its corresponding critical phase transition strength above which the driving force cannot be balanced out by the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction. We find that for large parameter space, the maximal hydrodynamic obstruction is larger than the Bodeker-Moore thermal friction, indicating that the conventional criterion for the runaway behavior of the bubble wall must be modified. We also explain how to apply efficiently the modified criterion to particle physics models and discuss possible limitations of the analysis carried out in this paper.", "authors": "Wen-Yuan Ai, Xander Nagels, Miguel Vanvlasselaer", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

Many properties of the objects in the cold classical Kuiper belt -- such as binarity, rotation, and size distribution -- are in agreement with this gravitational collapse model. Further support comes from the pebble-pile structure inferred for comet nuclei. For this study, we simulated the final assembly of a planetesimal from the gravitational collapse of a rotating clump of pebbles. We implemented a numerical method from granular dynamics to follow the collapse that includes the transition from a pebble swarm to solid cells at a high density. We compared the shapes of the simulated planetesimals with the shapes of the lobes of contact binaries and bilobed Solar System objects. We find that the gravitational collapse of slowly rotating pebble clouds naturally explains the formation of flattened ellipsoidal bodies.

Previous results have shown that the infrared counterpart is consistent with an O or B type star, but a clear classification is still lacking. We observed the counterpart twice, in 2019 and 2021, with the X-Shooter spectrograph operating on the VLT. The obtained spectra classify the counterpart as an O6 V type star.

This new O6 V classification for the companion star in HESS J1832-093 provides further support to an apparent grouping around a given spectral type for all discovered gamma-ray binaries that contain an O-type star.

They explained the survival of this exoplanet through a binary merger channel for 8 UMi. The key to testing this formation scenario is to derive the true age of this star: an old \"imposter\" resulting from a binary merger or a genuinely young red clump giant? To accomplish this, we derive kinematic and chemical properties for 8 UMi using astrometric data from $Gaia$ DR3 and the element-abundance pattern measured from a high-resolution ($R \\sim 75,000$) spectrum taken by SOPHIE. Our analysis shows that 8 UMi is a normal thin-disk star with orbital rotation speed of $\\it{V}_\\mathrm{\\phi}=\\mathrm{244.96 km s^{-1}}$, and possesses a Solar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= -0.01 \\pm 0.07$) and $\\alpha$-element abundance ratio ([$\\alpha$/Fe] $= 0.00 \\pm 0.03$). By adopting well-established relationships between age and space velocities/elemental abundances, we estimate a kinematic age of $3.50^{+3.00}_{-2.00}$ Gyr, and a chemical age of $2.75^{+1.50}_{-1.00}$ Gyr from [C/N] and $3.47 \\pm 1.96$ Gyr from [Y/Mg] for 8 UMi, respectively. These estimates are consistent with the isochrone-fitting age ($1.85^{+0.55}_{-0.30}$ Gyr) of 8 UMi, but are all much younger than 8.6 Gyr required in a binary merger scenario.

{"title": "Gamma-rays and Neutrinos from Giant Molecular Cloud Populations in the Galactic Plane", "abstract": "The recent detection of significant neutrino flux from the inner Galactic plane by the IceCube detector has provided us valuable insights on the spectrum of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. This flux can be produced either by a population of Galactic point sources or by diffused emission from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium or by a mixture of both. In this work, we compute diffused gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes produced by a population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our Galaxy, assuming different parametrizations of the Galactic diffused cosmic ray distribution. In particular, we take into account two main cases: (I) constant cosmic ray luminosity in our Galaxy, and (II) space-dependent cosmic ray luminosity based on the supernovae distribution in our Galaxy. For Case-I, we found that the neutrino flux from GMCs is a factor of $\\sim 10$ below compared to $\\pi^0$ and KRA$_\\gamma$ best-fitted models of IceCube observations at $10^5$ GeV. Instead, for Case-II the model can explain up to $\\sim 90 \\%$ of the neutrino flux at that energy. Moreover, for this scenario IceCube detector could be able to detect neutrino events from the Galactic centre regions. We then calculated the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from individual GMCs and noticed that several current and future Cherenkov telescopes and neutrino observatories have the right sensitivities to study these objects.

Using Horndeski gravity as a concrete example metric theory with an additional potentially massive scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational sector, the general memory formula is put into practice by presenting the first account of the memory correction sourced by the emission of massive field waves.

In this companion paper to the JWST Cas A paper, we investigate the filamentary X-ray structures associated with the \"Green Monster\" using Chandra X-ray Observatory data. We extracted spectra along the \"Green Monster\" as well as from shocked CSM regions. Both the extracted spectra and a principal component analysis show that the \"Green Monster\" emission properties are similar to those of the shocked CSM. The spectra are well-fit by a model consisting of a combination of a non-equilibrium ionization model and a power-law component, modified by Galactic absorption. All the \"Green Monster\" spectra show a blueshift of around ~2500 km/s, suggesting that the structure is on the near side of Cas A. The ionization age is around $n_{e}t$ = $1.4 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$s. This translates into a pre-shock density of ~11 cm$^{-3}$, higher than previous estimates of the unshocked CSM.

However, isotopic and petrological studies on primitive meteorites indicate a discrepancy of $\\gtrsim 10^{6}$ yr between the formation time of chondrules and that of chondritic parent bodies. Therefore chondrules should survive for $\\gtrsim 10^{6}$ yr in the solar nebula against the inward drift without subsequent growth (i.e., planetesimal formation). Here we investigate the conditions of the solar nebula that are suitable for the long lifetime of chondrule-sized dust particles. We take the turbulent strength, the radial pressure gradient force, and the disk metallicity of the solar nebula as free parameters. For 1 mm-radius-chondrules to survive and keep their size for $\\gtrsim 10^{6}$ yr, the suitable condition is a weak turbulence ($\\alpha \\sim 10^{-6}$), a flat radial profile ($\\eta \\lesssim 10^{-3}$), and a high metallicity ($Z\\sim 0.1$). This condition is qualitatively consistent with the characteristics of protoplanetary disks suggested by recent observations. We eventually propose that planetesimal formation may be induced by the disk evolution, e.g., the inside-out dispersal of the gas component due to the disk wind.", "authors": "Tetsuo Taki, Shigeru Wakita", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

They play an important role in the formation of double NS (DNS) systems and the chemical evolution of galaxies, and contribute to the NS mass distribution in observations. It is generally believed that EC-SNe originate from $e$-captures on $\\rm^{24}Mg$ and $\\rm^{20}Ne$ in the massive degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe) cores with masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit ($M_{\\rm Ch}$). However, the origin of EC-SNe is still uncertain. In this paper, we systematically studied the EC-SNe in NS+He star systems by considering the explosive oxygen burning that may occur in the near-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ ONe core. We provided the initial parameter spaces for producing EC-SNe in the initial orbital period $-$ initial He star mass (log$P_{\\rm orb}^{\\rm i}-M_{\\rm He}^{\\rm i}$) diagram, and found that both $M_{\\rm He}^{\\rm i}$ and minimum $P_{\\rm orb}^{\\rm i}$ for EC-SNe increase with metallicity.

{"title": "Vanadium oxide clusters in substellar atmospheres: A quantum chemical study", "abstract": "We aim to understand the formation of cloud condensation nuclei in oxygen-rich substellar atmospheres by calculating fundamental properties of the energetically most favorable vanadium oxide molecules and clusters. A hierarchical optimization approach is applied in order to find the most favorable structures for clusters of (VO)$_{N}$ and (VO$_2$)$_{N}$ for N=1-10, and (V$_2$O$_5$)$_{N}$ for N=1-4 and to calculate their thermodynamical potentials. The candidate geometries are initially optimized applying classical interatomic potentials and then refined at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level of theory to obtain accurate zero-point energies and thermochemical quantities. We present previously unreported vanadium oxide cluster structures as lowest-energy isomers. We report revised cluster energies and their thermochemical properties. Chemical equilibrium calculations are used to asses the impact of the updated and newly derived thermodynamic potentials on the gas-phase abundances of vanadium-bearing species. In chemical equilibrium, larger clusters from different stoichiometric families are found to be the most abundant vanadium-bearing species for temperatures below ~1000 K, while molecular VO is the most abundant between ~1000 K and ~2000 K. We determine the nucleation rates of each stoichiometric family for a given (T$_{gas}$, p$_{gas}$) profile of a brown dwarf using classical and non-classical nucleation theory. Small differences in the revised Gibbs free energies of the clusters have a large impact on the abundances of vanadium bearing species in chemical equilibrium at temperatures below ~1000 K, which subsequently has an impact on the nucleation rates of each stoichiometric family. We find that with the revised and more accurate cluster data non-classical nucleation rates are up to 15 orders of magnitude higher than classical nucleation rates.", "authors": "Helena Lecoq-Molinos, David Gobrecht, J.

The precise morphology of the orbiting dust remains only marginally constrained by existing data, subject to model-dependent inferences, and thus fundamental questions of its dynamical origin and evolution persist. This study presents a means to constrain the geometric distribution of the emitting dust using stellar pulsations measured at optical wavelengths as a variable illumination source of the dust, which re-radiates primarily in the infrared. By combining optical photometry from the Whole Earth Telescope with 0.7-2.5 micron spectroscopy obtained with SpeX at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, we detect luminosity variations at all observed wavelengths, with variations at most wavelengths corresponding to the behavior of the pulsating stellar photosphere, but towards the longest wavelengths the light curves probe the corresponding time-variability of the circumstellar dust. In addition to developing methodology, we find pulsation amplitudes decrease with increasing wavelength for principal pulsation modes, yet increase beyond approximately 2 microns for nonlinear combination frequencies. We interpret these results as combination modes deriving from principal modes of identical l values and discuss the implications for the morphology of the warm dust. We also draw attention to some discrepancies between our findings and theoretical expectations for the results of the non-linearity imposed by the surface convection zone on mode--mode interactions and on the behavior of the first harmonic of the highest-amplitude pulsation mode.", "authors": "T. von Hippel, J.

{"title": "The effect of AMR and grid stretching on the magnetized CME model in Icarus", "abstract": "Context. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main driver of solar wind disturbances near Earth. When directed towards us, the internal magnetic field of the CME can interact with the Earth`s magnetic field and cause geomagnetic storms. In order to better predict and avoid damage coming from such events, the optimized heliospheric model Icarus has been implemented. Aims. The impact of a CME at Earth is greatly affected by its internal magnetic field structure. The aim of this work is to enable modelling the evolution of the magnetic field configuration of the CME throughout its propagation in Icarus. The focus of the study is on the global magnetic structure of the CME and its evolution and interaction with the solar wind. Methods. The magnetized CME model that is implemented in Icarus is the Linear Force-Free Spheromak and is imported from EUHFORIA. Advanced techniques, such as grid stretching and AMR are applied. Different AMR levels are applied in order to obtain high resolution locally, where needed. The results of all the simulations are compared in detail and the wall-clock times of the simulations are provided. Results. The results from the performed simulations are analyzed. The arrival time is better approximated by the EUHFORIA simulation, with the CME shock arriving 1.6 and 1.09 hours later than in the AMR level 4 and 5 simulations, respectively. The profile features and variable strengths are best modelled by Icarus simulations with AMR level 4 and 5. Conclusions. The arrival time is closer to the observed time in the EUHFORIA simulation, but the profiles of the different variables show more features and details in the Icarus simulations. Considering the small difference in the modelled results, and the large difference in computational resources, the AMR level 4 simulation is considered to have performed the best.", "authors": "Baratashvili Tinatin, Poedts Stefaan", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Underestimation of the tidal force and apsidal motion in close binary systems by the perturbative approach: Comparisons with non-perturbative models", "abstract": "Stellar deformations play a significant role in the dynamical evolution of stars in binary systems, impacting the tidal dissipation and the outcomes of mass transfer processes. The prevalent method for modelling the deformations and tidal interactions of celestial bodies solely relies on the perturbative approach, which assumes that stellar deformations are minor perturbations to the spherical symmetry. An observable consequence of stellar deformations is the apsidal motion in eccentric systems. Our objective is to assert the reliability of the perturbative approach when applied to close and strongly deformed binary systems. We have developed a non-perturbative 3D modelling method designed to account for high stellar deformations to explore the limitations of the perturbative models. Our research highlights that the perturbative model becomes imprecise and underestimates the tidal force and rate of apsidal motion at a short orbital separation. This discrepancy primarily results from the first-order treatment in the perturbative approach, and cannot be rectified using straightforward mathematical corrections due to the strong non-linearity and numerous parameters of the problem. We have determined that our methodology affects the modelling of approximately 42% of observed binary systems with measured apsidal motion, introducing a discrepancy greater than 2% when the normalised orbital separation verifies q^(-1/5)a(1-e^2)/R1 < 6.5. The perturbative approach underestimates tidal interactions between bodies up to ~40% for close low-mass binaries. All the subsequent modelling is impacted by our findings, in particular, the tidal dissipation is significantly underestimated. As a result, all binary stellar models are imprecise when applied to systems with a low orbital separation, and the outcomes of these models are also affected by these inaccuracies.", "authors": "L.

Previous images show a very structured disk, with a pair of spiral arms thought to be launched by one or more external perturbers. The spiral features are visible in three of the four filters, with the non-detection in F410M due to the large detector saturation radius.

The gradual decay of flare was accompanied by an obviously developmental absorption feature in the blue wing of the H$_{\\alpha}$ and other active lines, which could be explained as cool post-flare loops which projected against the bright flare background.

In this study, the characteristics of the heated corona and chromosphere are investigated, and for the first time, the question of how they are abnormally heated is explicitly answered by analyzing the long-term observations of the global chromosphere in the Ca II K line and the global corona in the coronal green line. The findings reveal that both the quiet chromosphere and corona are in anti-phase with the solar cycle, whereas the active chromosphere and corona are in phase with it.

According to evolutionary models, this temperature range corresponds to stellar masses between 4~M$_\\odot$ and 6~M$_\\odot$ so the SED is not a priori inconsistent with the dynamical mass of S1A. The luminosity of S1 derived from SED-fitting, however, is only consistent with models for stellar masses above 5~M$_\\odot$.

Our objective is first to validate the idea that obtaining snapshot high-resolution radio images of massive binaries constitutes a relevant approach to unambiguously identify particle accelerators. Second, we intend to exploit these images to characterize the synchrotron emission of two specific targets, HD167971 and HD168112, known as particle accelerators. We traced the radio emission from the two targets at 1.6 GHz with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network, with an angular resolution of a few milli-arcseconds. Our measurements allowed us to obtain images for both targets. For HD167971, our observation occurs close to apastron, at an orbital phase where the synchrotron emission is minimum. For HD168112, we resolved for the very first time the synchrotron emission region. The emission region appears slightly elongated, in agreement with expectation for a colliding-wind region. In both cases the measured emission is significantly stronger than the expected thermal emission from the stellar winds, lending strong support for a non-thermal nature. Our study brings a significant contribution to the still poorly addressed question of high angular resolution radio imaging of colliding-wind binaries. We show that snapshot Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements constitute an efficient approach to investigate these objects, with promising results in terms of identification of additional particle accelerators, on top of being promising as well to reveal long period binaries.", "authors": "M.

{"title": "Yet Another Sunshine Mystery: Unexpected Asymmetry in GeV Emission from the Solar Disk", "abstract": "The Sun is one of the most luminous gamma-ray sources in the sky and continues to challenge our understanding of its high-energy emission mechanisms. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the solar disk gamma-ray emission, using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) spanning August 2008 to January 2022. We focus on gamma-ray events with energies exceeding 5 GeV, originating from 0.5$^{\\circ}$ angular aperture centered on the Sun, and implement stringent time cuts to minimize potential sample contaminants. We use a helioprojection method to resolve the gamma-ray events relative to the solar rotation axes, and combine statistical tests to investigate the distribution of events over the solar disk. We found that integrating observations over large time windows may overlook relevant asymmetrical features, which we reveal in this work through a refined time-dependent morphological analysis. We describe significant anisotropic trends and confirm compelling evidence of energy-dependent asymmetry in the solar disk gamma-ray emission. Intriguingly, the asymmetric signature coincides with the Sun's polar field flip during the cycle 24 solar maximum, around June 2014. Our findings suggest that the Sun's magnetic configuration plays a significant role in shaping the resulting gamma-ray signature, highlighting a potential link between the observed anisotropies, solar cycle, and the solar magnetic fields. These insights pose substantial challenges to established emission models, prompting fresh perspectives on high-energy solar astrophysics.", "authors": "Bruno Arsioli, Elena Orlando", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},

A large scale pseudoscalar field can be the coherent superposition of axions or axion like particles. We consider the evolution of these fields in a thin spherical layer. Decomposing the magnetic field into the poloidal and toroidal components, we take into account their symmetry properties. The dependence of the pseudoscalar field on the latitude is accounted for the induction equation. Then, we derive the dynamo equations in the low mode approximation. The nonlinear evolution equations for the harmonics of the magnetic and pseudoscalar fields are solved numerically. As an application, we consider a dense axion star embedded in solar plasma. The behavior of the harmonics and their typical oscillations frequencies are obtained. We suggest that such small objects consisting of axions and confined magnetic fields can cause the recently observed flashes in solar corona contributing to its heating.", "authors": "Maxim Dvornikov", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},

The main results are as follows: (1) the mean magnetic flux decay rates of the two sunspots are -1.7*10^20 and -1.4*10^20 Mx/day; (2) the magnetic flux generation rate of all MMFs is calculated to be -1.9 *10^21 Mx/day, which is on average 5.6 times higher than the total magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; (3) the magnetic flux of V-MMFs (including a pore separated from the sunspots) is 1.4 times larger than the total lost magnetic flux of the two sunspots, and in a later stage when the pore has passed through the reference ellipse, the magnetic flux generation rate of the V-MMFs is almost the same as the magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; and (4) within the gap, the magnetic flux of V-MMFs is one third of the total magnetic flux.

Rocky planets form by the concentration of solid particles in the inner few au regions of planet-forming disks. Their chemical composition reflects the materials in the disk available in the solid phase at the time the planets were forming. Aims. We aim to constrain the structure and dust composition of the inner disk of the young star HD 144432, using an extensive set of infrared interferometric data taken by the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), combining PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE observations. Methods. We introduced a new physical disk model, TGMdust, to image the interferometric data, and to fit the disk structure and dust composition. We also performed equilibrium condensation calculations with GGchem. Results. Our best-fit model has three disk zones with ring-like structures at 0.15, 1.3, and 4.1 au. Assuming that the dark regions in the disk at ~0.9 au and at ~3 au are gaps opened by planets, we estimate the masses of the putative gap-opening planets to be around a Jupiter mass. We find evidence for an optically thin emission ($\\tau<0.4$) from the inner two disk zones ($r<4$ au) at $\\lambda>3\\ \\mu$m. Our silicate compositional fits confirm radial mineralogy gradients. To identify the dust component responsible for the infrared continuum emission, we explore two cases for the dust composition, one with a silicate+iron mixture and the other with a silicate+carbon one. We find that the iron-rich model provides a better fit to the spectral energy distribution. Conclusions. We propose that in the warm inner regions ($r<5$ au) of typical planet-forming disks, most if not all carbon is in the gas phase, while iron and iron sulfide grains are major constituents of the solid mixture along with forsterite and enstatite.

We also investigate how the shear in magnetic field surrounding a prominence may impact the release of the gravitational potential energy of the prominence material. We show that the flow decoupling is strongest in the plane normal to the direction of the magnetic field, where neutral pressure gradients drive ion-neutral drifts and frictional heating is balanced by adiabatic cooling of the expanding prominence material. We also show that magnetic field within the mixing plane can lead to faster non-linear release of the gravitational energy driving the RTI, while more efficiently heating the plasma via viscous dissipation of associated plasma flows. We relate the computational results to potential observables by highlighting how integrating over under-resolved two-fluid sub-structure may lead to misinterpretation of observational data.", "authors": "V.

We employ a k-means clustering routine to classify Stokes V spectra in the penumbra of a sunspot. 75% of the penumbral region is dominated by profiles comprising two, nearly anti-symmetric lobes, while 21% of the area is occupied by three-lobed profiles that represent the Evershed flow returning to the photosphere. 4% of the area is dominated by four profile groups - Group 1: three-lobed profiles in which both the rest and strong downflowing component have the same polarity as the sunspot and seen exclusively in the light bridge. Group 2: single, red-lobed profiles over an area of about 2% seen at the outer penumbra in discrete patches that possibly signify the downflowing leg of an Omega-loop. Group 3: three-lobed/highly asymmetric profiles, where the rest and strong downflowing component have a polarity opposite the sunspot. These occupy 1.4% of the penumbral area over conspicuous, elongated structures or isolated patches in the outer penumbra and penumbra-QS boundary. Group 4: three lobed-profiles, in which the rest component has the same polarity as the sunspot and a weaker, upflowing component with an opposite polarity. These profiles are located near the entrance of the light bridge and are found in only 0.12% of the penumbral area. These minority groups of profiles could be related to dynamic phenomena that could affect the overlying chromosphere.

Their evolution, driven by $\\mathrm{AML_{MB}}$ and AML by gravitational radiation (GR, $\\mathrm{AML_{GR}}$), leaves them extremely H-exhausted to the point of being indistinguishable from AM CVn stars formed via the He-star and the White Dwarf (WD) channels in terms of the absence of H in their spectra. We further show that (4) owing to the presence of a significant radiative region, intermediate-mass giants/sub-giants, which are progenitors of AM CVn stars formed through the He-star channel, may undergo common envelope evolution that does not behave classically, (5) several AM CVn systems with extremely bloated donors, such as Gaia14aae, ZTFJ1637+49 and SRGeJ045359.9+622444 do not match any modelled trajectories if these systems are modelled only with $\\mathrm{AML_{GR}}$, (6) the uncertainties in MB greatly affect modelling results.

{"title": "The enigmatic dance of the HD 189733A system: Does the planet accrete onto the star?", "abstract": "Several studies suggest that the emission properties of a star can be affected by its interaction with a nearby planet. However, the actual observability of these effects remains a subject of debate. An example is the HD189733A system, where some characteristics of its emissions have been interpreted as indicative of ongoing interactions between the star and its planet. Other studies attribute these characteristics to the coronal activity of the star. In this work, we investigate whether the observed stellar X-ray flare events, which appear to be in phase with the planetary period in the HD189733A system, could be attributed to the accretion of the planetary wind onto the stellar surface or resulted from an interaction between the planetary and stellar winds. We developed a 3D MHD model that describes the system HD189733A, including the central host star and its hot Jupiter, along with their respective winds. The effects of gravity and the magnetic fields of both star and planet are taken into account. In the cases examined in this study, the accretion scenario is only viable when the stellar and planetary magnetic field strengths are at 5 G and 1 G, respectively. In this case, the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs) lead to the formation of an accretion column connecting star and planet. Once formed the column remains stable for the entire simulation. The accretion column yields an accretion rates of about 1e12 g/s and shows a mean density of about 1e7 cm^-3. In the other cases, the accretion column does not form because the RTI is suppressed by the stronger magnetic field intensities assumed for both the star and the planet. We synthesized the emission resulting from the shocked planetary wind and, its total X-ray emission ranges from 5e23 to 1e24 erg/s. In the case of accretion, the emission originating from the hot spot cannot be distinguished from the coronal activity.", "authors": "Salvatore Colombo, Ignazio Pillitteri, Antonino Petralia, Salvatore Orlando, Giuseppina Micela", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

These values were obtained through a chi^2 minimisation process, comparing LAMOST spectra with corresponding grids of synthetically broadened spectra. Due to the resolution and the spectral range of LAMOST, v sin i measurements are limited to stars with effective temperature (Teff) ranging from 5000 K to 8500 K for MRS and 7000 K to 9000 K for LRS. The detectable v sin i for MRS is set between 27 km/s and 350 km/s , and for LRS between 110 km/s and 350 km/s, This limitation is because the convolved reference spectra become less informative beyond 350 km/s. The intrinsic precisions of v sin i , determined from multi-epoch observations, is approximately 4.0 km/s for MRS and 10.0 km/s for LRS at signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 50.

Using the tracked information of BMRs based on AutoTAB, we confirm that the distribution of bmax reported by Jha et al. (2020) is not because of the BMRs are picked multiple times at the different phases of their evolution instead it is also present if we consider each BMRs only once. Moreover, we find that the slope of Joy's law initially increases slowly with the increase of bmax. However, when bmax>2.5 kG, gamma_0 decreases. The decrease of observed $gamma_0$ with bmax provides a hint to a nonlinear tilt quenching in the Babcock-Leighton process.", "authors": "Bibhuti Kumar Jha, Anu B.

{"title": "Element Abundances and the Physics of Solar Energetic Particles", "abstract": "Acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) causes their abundances, measured at constant velocity, to be enhanced or suppressed as a function of each ion's magnetic rigidity, and hence its atomic mass-to-charge ratio A/Q. Ion charges, in turn, depend upon source electron temperature. In small \"impulsive\" SEP events, arising from solar jets, acceleration during magnetic reconnection causes steep power-law abundance enhancements. These impulsive SEP events can have 1000-fold enhancements of heavy elements from sources at ~2.5 MK, and similar enhancements of 3He/4He and of streaming electrons that drive type-III radio bursts. Gamma-ray lines show that solar flares also accelerate 3He-rich ions, but their electrons and ions remain trapped on magnetic loops so they dissipate their energy as X-rays, gamma-rays, heat, and light. \"Gradual\" SEPs accelerated at shock waves, driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can show power-law abundance enhancements or depressions, even with see ions from the ambient solar corona. In addition, shocks can reaccelerate seed particles from residual impulsive SEPs with their pre-existing signature heavy-ion enhancements. Different patterns of abundance often show that heavy elements are dominated by a different source from that of H and He. Nevertheless, the SEP abundances averaged over many large events define the abundances of the corona itself, which is found to differ from the solar photosphere as a function of the first ionization potential (FIP) since ions, with FIP < 10 eV, are driven upward by forces of electromagnetic waves which neutral atoms, with FIP > 10 eV, cannot feel. Thus, SEPs provide a measurement of element abundances in the solar corona, distinct from the solar wind, and may even better define the photosphere for some elements.", "authors": "Donald V.

{"title": "Formation of millisecond pulsars with wide orbits", "abstract": "Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are a kind of radio pulsars with short spin periods, playing a key role in many aspects of stellar astrophysics. In recent years, some more MSPs with wide orbits ($>30\\,\\rm d$) have been discovered, but their origin is still highly unclear. In the present work, according to an adiabatic power-law assumption for the mass-transfer process, we carried out a large number of complete binary evolution computations for the formation of MSPs with wide orbits through the iron core-collapse supernova (CCSN) channel, in which a neutron star (NS) originating from a CCSN accretes matter from a red-giant (RG) star and spun up to millisecond periods. We found that this channel can form the observed MSPs with wide orbits in the range of $30-1200\\,{\\rm d}$, in which the WD companions have masses in the range of $0.28-0.55\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$. We also found that almost all the observed MSPs can be reproduced by this channel in the WD companion mass versus orbital period diagram.

{"title": "Simple Model for Temporal Variations of H$α$ Spectrum by an Eruptive Filament from a Superflare on a Solar-type Star", "abstract": "Flares are intense explosions on the solar and stellar surfaces, and solar flares are sometimes accompanied by filament or prominence eruptions. Recently, a large filament eruption associated with a superflare on a solar-type star EK Dra was discovered for the first time. The absorption of the H$\\alpha$ spectrum initially exhibited a blueshift with the velocity of $510$ (km s$^{-1}$), and decelerated in time probably due to gravity. Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were thought to occur, although the filament eruption did not exceed the escape velocity under the surface gravity. To investigate how such filament eruption occur and whether CMEs are associated with the filament eruption or not, we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along an expanding magnetic loop emulating a filament eruption under adiabatic and unsteady conditions. The loop configuration and expanding velocity normal to the loop are specified in the configuration parameters, and we calculate the line-of-sight velocity of the filament eruption using the velocities along and normal to the loop. We found that (i) the temporal variations of the H$\\alpha$ spectrum for EK Dra can be explained by falling filament eruption in the loop with longer time and larger spatial scales than that of the Sun, and (ii) the stellar CMEs are also thought to be associated with the filament eruption from the superflare on EK Dra, because the rarefied loop unobserved in the H$\\alpha$ spectrum needs to expand faster than the escape velocity, whereas the observed filament eruption does not exceed the escape velocity.", "authors": "Kai Ikuta, Kazunari Shibata", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

We used our own optical spectroscopy combined with archival ultraviolet spectroscopy and photometry to derive basic parameters and surface abundances of selected stars. The resulting parameterst served as input for the METUJE stellar wind code, which predicts the wind structure of these stars. We compared the derived wind parameters with the predictions derived for solar abundances. The optical analysis showed that both subdwarfs have effective temperatures in excess of 60 kK and a strong overabundance of carbon in the case of CD-46 8926 and nitrogen in the case of CD-51 11879. We interpret the abundance patterns as being a result of enrichment by the products of nuclear reactions. The modified abundances reduce the wind mass-loss rate by tens of percent. The reduction improves the predicted wind line profiles in comparison to observations. The change in helium abundance does not have a strong effect on the wind parameters. As a result of a lower estimated bolometric luminosity and mass-loss rate and a larger distance, the expected X-ray luminosities become lower and agree with observationas. The nucleosynthesis does not significantly alter the strength of the wind of hot subdwarfs, but the inclusion of proper stellar parameters improves the agreement with observational wind characteristics. Our analysis indicates that subdwarfs overabundant in helium are typically able to launch wind. This conclusion is supported by data gathered for thousands of subdwarfs from the literature, which shows that subdwarfs overabundant in helium avoid the region in the Kiel diagram where the winds are predicted to be absent. This can be interpreted in terms of the gravitational settling of helium, which is suppressed by the winds.", "authors": "J. Krticka, I. Krtickova, J. Janik, P. Nemeth, J. Kubat, M.

In this work, we investigate the capacity of data-driven modal analysis, Dynamic Mode Decomposition, to identify coherent magnetic field structures of this model. In its canonical form, the only existing field scale corresponds to the dynamo instability. To take into account multi-scale nature of the dynamo, the model was augmented with coherent in time flow field, forcing small-scale magnetic field with a faster temporal evolution. Two clusters of DMD modes were obtained: the ``slow\" cluster, located near the dynamo wave frequency and associated with its nonlinear self-interaction, and the ``fast\" cluster, centered around the forcing frequency and resulting from the interaction between the wave and the flow. Compared to other widely used methods of data analysis, such as Fourier transform, DMD provides a natural spatiotemporal basis for the dynamo, related to its nonlinear dynamics. We assess how the parameters of the DMD model, rank and delay, influence its accuracy, and finally discuss the limitations of this approach when applied to randomly forced, more complex dynamo flows.", "authors": "Anna Guseva", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Spectroscopic Observations of Coronal Rain Formation and Evolution following an X2 Solar Flare", "abstract": "A significant impediment to solving the coronal heating problem is that we currently only observe active region (AR) loops in their cooling phase. Previous studies showed that the evolution of cooling loop densities and apex temperatures are insensitive to the magnitude, duration, and location of energy deposition. Still, potential clues to how energy is released are encoded in the cooling phase properties. The appearance of coronal rain, one of the most spectacular phenomena of the cooling phase, occurs when plasma has cooled below 1MK, which sets constraints on the heating frequency, for example. Most observations of coronal rain have been made by imaging instruments. Here we report rare Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) observations of a loop arcade where coronal rain forms following an X2.1 limb flare. A bifurcation in plasma composition measurements between photospheric at 1.5MK and coronal at 3.5MK suggests that we are observing post-flare driven coronal rain. Increases in non-thermal velocities and densities with decreasing temperature (2.7MK to 0.6MK) suggest that we are observing the formation and subsequent evolution of the condensations. Doppler velocity measurements imply that a 10% correction of apparent flows in imaging data is reasonable. Emission measure analysis at 0.7MK shows narrow temperature distributions, indicating coherent behaviour reminiscent of that observed in coronal loops. The space-time resolution limitations of EIS suggest that we are observing the largest features or rain showers. These observations provide insights into the heating rate, source, turbulence, and collective behaviour of coronal rain from observations of the loop cooling phase.", "authors": "David H.

The Dreicer electric field $E_{Dr}$ is determined as a critical electric field at which the entire electron population runs away. Two regimes of strong ($E \\lesssim E_{Dr}$) and weak ($E \\ll E_{Dr}$) electric field are discussed. It is shown that the commonly used formal definition of the Dreicer field leads to an overestimation of its value by about five times. The critical velocity at which the electrons of the ``tail'' of the Maxwell distribution become runaway under the action of the sub-Dreiser electric fields turns out to be underestimated by $\\sqrt{3}$ times in some works because the Coulomb collisions between runaway and thermal electrons are not taken into account.

We confirm that the pattern of cool and cloudy anticyclonic zones and warm cloud-free cyclonic belts persists throughout the mid-latitudes, up to the polar boundaries, and evidence a strong correlation with the vertical maximum windshear and the locations of Jupiter's zonal jets. At high latitudes, VISIR images reveal a large region of mid-infrared cooling poleward $\\sim$64$^{\\circ}$N and $\\sim$67$^{\\circ}$S extending from the upper troposphere to the stratosphere, co-located with the reflective aerosols observed by JunoCam, and suggesting that aerosols play a key role in the radiative cooling at the poles. Comparison of zonal-mean thermal properties and high-resolution visible imaging from Juno allows us to study the variability of atmospheric properties as a function of altitude and jet boundaries, particularly in the cold southern polar vortex. However, the southern stratospheric polar vortex is partly masked by a warm mid-infrared signature of the aurora. Co-located with the southern main auroral oval, this warming results from the auroral precipitation and/or joule heating which heat the atmosphere and thus cause a significant stratospheric emission. This high emission results from a large enhancement of both ethane and acetylene in the polar region, reinforcing the evidence of enhanced ion-related chemistry in Jupiter's auroral regions.", "authors": "Deborah Bardet, Padraig T.

{"title": "Nanofluidic platform for studying the first-order phase transitions in superfluid helium-3", "abstract": "The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases $^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel intrinsic mechanisms.", "authors": "Petri J.

The rotational modulation and evolution of spots and/or faculae can induce variations in the RVs at the level of a few m/s in Sun-like stars. To overcome this, a multi-dimensional Gaussian Process framework has been developed to model the stellar activity signal using spectroscopic activity indicators together with the RVs. A recently published computationally efficient implementation of this framework, S+LEAF 2, enables the rapid analysis of large samples of targets with sizeable data sets. In this work, we apply this framework to HARPS observations of 268 well-observed targets with precisely determined stellar parameters. Our long-term goal is to quantify the effectiveness of this framework to model and mitigate activity signals for stars of different spectral types and activity levels.

As a pilot investigation, we focus on two specific cases: a gas giant and a sub-Neptune-sized planet, both orbiting a rapidly cooling WD with mass $M_\\ast$ = 0.6 \\msun\\ and separation $a$ = 0.02 AU. In both cases, the ensuing mass outflow rates exceed $10^{14}$ g sec$^{-1}$ for WD temperatures greater than $T_{\\rm WD} \\simeq$ 50,000 K. At $T_{\\rm WD} \\simeq$ 18,000 K [/22,000 K], the sub-Neptune [/gas giant] mass outflow rate approaches $10^{12}$ g sec$^{-1}$, i.e., comparable to the strongest outflows expected from close-in planets around late main-sequence stars. Whereas the gas giant remains virtually unaffected from an evolutionary standpoint, atmospheric escape may have sizable effects for the sub-Neptune, depending on its dynamical history, e.g., assuming that the hydrogen-helium envelope makes up 1 [/4] per cent of the planet mass, the entire envelope would be evaporated away so long as the planet reaches 0.02 AU within the first 230 [/130] Myr of the WD formation. We discuss how these results can be generalized to eccentric orbits with effective semi-major axis $a'=a/(1-e^2)^{1/4}$, which receive the same orbit-averaged irradiation. Extended to a much broader parameter space, this approach can be exploited to model the expected demographics of WD planets as a function of their initial mass, composition and migration history, as well as their potential for habitability.", "authors": "Elena Gallo, Andrea Caldiroli, Riccardo Spinelli, Francesco Haardt, Mary Anne Limbach, Juliette Becker, Fred Adams", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

Compared to the Navarro--Frenk--White density profile, we show that using an adiabatically contracted halo profile suppresses the line intensity in the halo outskirts and enhances it in the Galactic Centre (GC), although this enhancement is eliminated by the likely presence of a core within 3~kpc.

Transition disks (TDs) with large inner dust cavities are the ideal targets to study the inner tens of au of disks, as the central emission can be fully disentangled from the outer disk emission. We present a homogeneous multi-wavelength analysis of the continuum emission in a sample of 11 TDs. We investigate the nature of the central emission close to the star, distinguishing between thermal dust and free-free emission. Spatially resolved measurements of continuum emission from archival ALMA data are combined with literature cm-wave observations to study the spectral indices of the inner and outer disks separately. While the emission from the outer disks is consistent with thermal dust emission, 10/11 of the spectral indices estimated for the central emission close to the star suggest that this emission is free-free emission, likely associated with an ionized jet or a disk wind. No correlation between the free-free luminosity and the accretion luminosity or the X-ray luminosity is found, arguing against the photoevaporative wind origin. A sub-linear correlation between the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion rate onto the star is observed, suggesting an origin in an ionized jet. The relative lack of mm-dust grains in the majority of inner disks in transition disks suggests that either such dust grains have drifted quickly towards the central star, grain growth is less efficient in the inner disk, or grains grow rapidly to planetesimal sizes in the inner disk. The observed correlation between the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion rate suggests the outflow is strictly connected with the stellar accretion and that accretion in these disks is driven by a jet.", "authors": "Alessia A.

The exact nature of the self--interactions can lead to either expansion or collapse of the core within the halo lifetime, leaving distinctive signatures in the dark matter distributions not only at the halo center but throughout the virial region. Optical galaxy surveys, which precisely measure the weak lensing of background galaxies by massive foreground clusters, allow us to directly measure the matter distribution within clusters and probe subtle effects of self--interacting dark matter (SIDM) throughout the halo's full radial range. We compare the weak--lensing measurements reported by Shin et al. 2021, which use lens clusters identified by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Survey and source galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey, with predictions from SIDM models having either elastic or dissipative self--interactions. To model the weak--lensing observables, we use cosmological N-body simulations for elastic self--interactions and semi-analytical fluid simulations for dissipative self--interactions. We find that current weak--lensing measurements already constrain the isotropic and elastic SIDM to a cross-section per mass of $\\sigma/m<1~{\\rm cm^2/g}$ at a $95\\%$ confidence level. The same measurements also impose novel constraints on the energy loss per unit mass for dissipative SIDM.

{"title": "Constraining the clustering and 21-cm signature of radio galaxies at cosmic dawn", "abstract": "The efficiency of radio emission is an important unknown parameter of early galaxies at cosmic dawn, as models with high efficiency have been shown to modify the cosmological 21-cm signal substantially, deepening the absorption trough and boosting the 21-cm power spectrum. Such models have been previously directly constrained by the overall extragalactic radio background as observed by ARCADE-2 and LWA-1. In this work, we constrain the clustering of high redshift radio sources by utilizing the observed upper limits on arcminute-scale anisotropy from the VLA at 4.9~GHz and ATCA at 8.7~GHz. Using a semi-numerical simulation of a plausible astrophysical model for illustration, we show that the clustering constraints on the radio efficiency are much stronger than those from the overall background intensity, by a factor that varies from 12 at redshift 7 to 30 at redshift 22. As a result, the predicted maximum depth of the global 21-cm signal is lowered by a factor of 5 (to 1700~mK), and the maximum 21-cm power spectrum peak at cosmic dawn is lowered by a factor of 24 (to $2\\times 10^5$~mK$^2$). We conclude that the observed clustering is the strongest current direct constraint on such models, but strong early radio emission from galaxies remains viable for producing a strongly enhanced 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn.", "authors": "Sudipta Sikder, Rennan Barkana, Anastasia Fialkov", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

Inspired by a semiclassical method that integrates the GUP into the partition function by deforming its phase space, we induce a modification on the thermodynamic quantities of the MIT bag model that we propose serves as an effective semiclassical description of deconfined quark matter in a space with minimal length. We investigate the consequences of this deformation on the zero-temperature limit, revealing a saturation limit for the energy density, pressure and baryon number density and an overall decrease of the thermodynamic quantities which suggests an enhanced stability against gravitational collapse. These findings extend existing research on GUP-deformed Fermi gases.

{"title": "Free-floating \"planets'' in the macrolensed quasar Q2237+0305", "abstract": "It has been claimed that the variability of field quasars resembles gravitational lensing by a large cosmological population of free-floating planets with mass of about 10 Earths. But Galactic photometric monitoring experiments, on the other hand, exclude a large population of such planetary-mass gravitational lenses. These apparently contradictory pieces of evidence can be reconciled if the objects under consideration have a mean column-density that lies between the critical column-densities for gravitational lensing in these two contexts. Dark matter in that form is known to be weakly collisional, so that a core develops in galaxy halo density profiles, and a preferred model has already been established. Here we consider what such a model implies for Q2237+0305, which is the best-studied example of a quasar that is strongly lensed by an intervening galaxy. We construct microlensing magnification maps appropriate to the four macro-images of the quasar -- all of which are seen through the bulge of the galaxy. Each of these maps exhibits a caustic network arising from the stars, plus many small, isolated caustics arising from the free-floating \"planets\" in the lens galaxy. The \"planets\" have little influence on the magnification histograms but a large effect on the statistics of the magnification gradients. We compare our predictions to the published OGLE photometry of Q2237+0305 and find that these data are consistent with the presence of the hypothetical \"planets\". However, the evidence is relatively weak because the OGLE dataset is not well suited to testing our predictions and requires low-pass filtering for this application.

{"title": "Distinguishing oceans of water from magma on mini-Neptune K2-18b", "abstract": "Mildly irradiated mini-Neptunes have densities potentially consistent with them hosting substantial liquid water oceans (`Hycean' planets). The presence of CO2 and simultaneous absence of ammonia (NH3) in their atmospheres has been proposed as a fingerprint of such worlds. JWST observations of K2-18b, the archetypal Hycean, have found the presence of CO2 and the depletion of NH3 to <100 ppm; hence, it has been inferred that this planet may host liquid water oceans. In contrast, climate modelling suggests that many of these mini-Neptunes, including K2-18b, may likely be too hot to host liquid water. We propose a solution to this discrepancy between observation and climate modelling by investigating the effect of a magma ocean on the atmospheric chemistry of mini-Neptunes. We demonstrate that atmospheric NH3 depletion is a natural consequence of the high solubility of nitrogen species in magma at reducing conditions; precisely the conditions prevailing where a thick hydrogen envelope is in communication with a molten planetary surface. The magma ocean model reproduces the present JWST spectrum of K2-18b to < 3 sigma, suggesting this is as credible an explanation for current observations as the planet hosting a liquid water ocean. Spectral areas that could be used to rule out the magma ocean model include the >4um region, where CO2 and CO features dominate: Magma ocean models suggest a systematically lower CO2/CO ratio than estimated from free chemistry retrieval, indicating that deeper observations of this spectral region may be able to distinguish between oceans of liquid water and magma on mini-Neptunes.", "authors": "Oliver Shorttle, Sean Jordan, Harrison Nicholls, Tim Lichtenberg, Dan J.

{"title": "Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting: Demonstration of working principles down to the Poisson regime", "abstract": "Neural networks are being extensively used for modelling data, especially in the case where no likelihood can be formulated. Although in the case of X-ray spectral fitting, the likelihood is known, we aim to investigate the neural networks ability to recover the model parameters but also their associated uncertainties, and compare its performance with standard X-ray spectral fitting, whether following a frequentist or Bayesian approach. We apply Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation (SBI-NPE) to X-ray spectra. We train a network with simulated spectra, and then it learns the mapping between the simulated spectra and their parameters and returns the posterior distribution. The model parameters are sampled from a predefined prior distribution. To maximize the efficiency of the training of the neural network, yet limiting the size of the training sample to speed up the inference, we introduce a way to reduce the range of the priors, either through a classifier or a coarse and quick inference of one or multiple observations. SBI-NPE is demonstrated to work equally well as standard X-ray spectral fitting, both in the Gaussian and Poisson regimes, both on simulated and real data, yielding fully consistent results in terms of best fit parameters and posterior distributions. The inference time is comparable to or smaller than the one needed for Bayesian inference. On the other hand, once properly trained, an amortized SBI-NPE network generates the posterior distributions in no time. We show that SBI-NPE is less sensitive to local minima trapping than standard fit statistic minimization techniques. We find that the neural network can be trained equally well on dimension-reduced spectra, via a Principal Component Decomposition, leading to a shorter inference time. Neural posterior estimation thus adds up as a complementary tool for X-ray spectral fitting. (abridged).", "authors": "Didier Barret, Simon Dupourqué", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

Where available, we add the environmental information from the host galaxy. We focus on identifying sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae without imposing the pre-defined sub-classes found in the literature to date. To do so, we employ an implicit-rank minimizing autoencoder neural network for developing low-dimensional data representations, providing a compact representation of the supernova light curve diversity. When we analyze light curves alone, we find that one of our resulting latent variables is strongly correlated with redshift, allowing us to approximately ``de-redshift'' the other latent variables describing each event.

We first examine the degeneracies between the parameters of the Tidal Alignment - Tidal Torquing (TATT) model for IA and of a photo-z model including a mean shift ($\\Delta \\bar{z}$) and variance ($\\sigma_{z}$) for each tomographic bin of lenses and sources, under a variety of underlying true IA behaviors. We identify strong degeneracies between: (1) the redshift scaling of the tidal alignment amplitude and the mean shift and variances of source bins, (2) the redshift scaling of the tidal torquing amplitude and the variance of the lowest-$z$ source bin, and (3) the IA source density weighting and the mean shift and variance of several source bins. We then use this information to guide our exploration of the level of cosmological parameter bias which can be induced given incorrect modelling of IA, photo-z, or both. We find that marginalizing over all the parameters of TATT is generally sufficient to preclude cosmological parameter bias in the scenarios we consider. However, this does not necessarily mean that IA and photo-z parameters are themselves unbiased, nor does it mean that the best-fit model is a good fit to the data.

Highly supersonic jets launched by active galactic nuclei (AGN) power a cocoon that confines them and shocks the ambient medium. We build upon the models of narrow conical jets interacting with a smooth ambient medium, to include the effect of dense clouds that are an essential ingredient of a multiphase ISM. The key physical ingredient of this model is that the clouds along the supersonic jet-beam strongly decelerate the jet-head, but the subsonic cocoon easily moves around the clouds without much resistance. We propose scalings for important physical quantities -- cocoon pressure, head & cocoon speed, and jet radius. We obtain, for the first time, the analytic condition on clumpiness of the ambient medium for the jet to dissipate within the cocoon and verify it with numerical simulations of conical jets interacting with a uniform ISM with embedded spherical clouds. A jet is defined to be dissipated when the cocoon speed exceeds the speed of the jet-head. We compare our models to more sophisticated numerical simulations, direct observations of jet-ISM interaction (e.g., quasar J1316+1753), and discuss implications for the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles.

This is in stark contrast to the inflationary case, where recoherence has been previously observed in some situations. Although the purity can be computed for couplings of all sizes, we also study the purity perturbatively and observe that late-time (secular growth) breakdown of perturbation theory often occurs in these cases. Instead, we establish a simple yet powerful late-time purity resummation which captures the exact evolution to a remarkable level, while maintaining analytical control.

We emphasize that it is possible to determine the amount of particle production by focusing on the mathematical properties of the mode function equations,i.e. their singularities and monodromies, sidestepping the need to solve those equations. We consider in detail creation of scalar and spin 1/2 particles in four dimensional asymptotically Minkowski flat FLRW spacetimes. We explain that when the mode function equation for scalar fields has only regular singular points, the corresponding scale factors are asymptotically Minkowski. For Dirac spin 1/2 fields, the requirement of mode function equations with only regular points is more restrictive, and picks up a subset of the aforementioned scale factors. For the scalar case, we argue that there are two different regimes of particle production; while most of the literature has focused on only one of these regimes, the other regime presents enhanced particle production. On the other hand, for Dirac fermions we find a single regime of particle production. Finally, we very briefly comment on the possibility of studying particle production in spacetimes that don't asymptote to Minkowski, by considering mode function equations with irregular singular points.", "authors": "Bartomeu Fiol, Mickael Komendyak, Jordi Ruiz-Ponsell", "date": " 5 Jan 2024 ("},

{"title": "The Sonified Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram", "abstract": "Understanding the physical properties of stars, and putting these properties into the context of stellar evolution, is a core challenge in astronomical research. A key visualization in studying stellar evolution is the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), organizing data about stellar luminosity and colour into a form that is informative about stellar structure and evolution. However, connecting the HRD with other sources of information, including stellar time series, is an outstanding challenge. Here we present a new method to turn stellar time series into sound. This method encodes physically meaningful features such that auditory comparisons between sonifications of different stars preserve astrophysical differences between them. We present an interactive multimedia version of the HRD that combines both visual and auditory components and that allows exploration of different types of stars both on and off the main sequence through both visual and auditory media.", "authors": "Daniela Huppenkothen, Juan Pampin, James R.A.

{"title": "The primordial black holes solution to the cosmological monopole problem", "abstract": "Recently, the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, including CPTA, EPTA, NANOGrav, and PPTA, announced that they detected a stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum in the nHz band. This may be relevant to the cosmological phase transition suggested by some models. Magnetic monopoles and primordial black holes (PBHs), two unsolved mysteries in the universe, may also have their production related to the cosmological phase transition. Inspired by that, we revisit the model proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, which involves PBHs accretion to solve the cosmological magnetic monopole problem. We further develop it by considering the increase in the mass of the PBHs during accretion and taking the effect of Hawking radiation into account. With these new considerations, we find that solutions to the problem still exist within a certain parameter space. In {addition}, we also generalize the analysis to PBHs with {an} extended distribution in mass. This may be a more interesting scenario because PBHs that have accreted magnetic monopoles might produce observable electromagnetic signals if they are massive enough to survive in the late universe.", "authors": "Xin-Zhe Wang, Can-Min Deng", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Two sequences of spiral galaxies with different shapes of the metallicity gradients", "abstract": "We considered two sequences of spiral galaxies with different shapes of the radial gas-phase oxygen abundance distributions from the galaxies in the MaNGA survey: (1) Galaxies in which the gradient is well approximated by a single linear relation across the whole disc, that is, galaxies with an S (slope) gradients, (2) galaxies in which the metallicity in the inner region of the disc is at a nearly constant level and the gradient is negative at larger radii, that is, galaxies with level-slope (LS) gradients. We also selected galaxies with a nearly uniform oxygen abundance across the whole galaxy, that is, galaxies with level (L) gradients that can be the final evolutionary stage of the two galaxy sequences described above. The radial nitrogen abundance distributions in galaxies with LS oxygen abundance distributions also show breaks at radii smaller than the O/H distribution breaks. The observed behaviour of the oxygen and nitrogen abundances with radius in these galaxies can be explained by the time delay between the nitrogen and oxygen enrichment together with the variation in the star formation history along the radius. These galaxies clearly show the effect of the inside-out disc evolution model. We find that the shape of the radial abundance distribution in a galaxy is not related to its macroscopic characteristics (rotation velocity, stellar mass, isophotal radius, and star formation rate). The correlations between the gradient slopes and macroscopic characteristics of galaxies are weak in the sense that the scatter of the points in each diagram is large. We also examined the properties of the Milky Way in the context of the considered galaxy samples.", "authors": "L.S.Pilyugin, G.Tautvaisiene", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Parameter Space of Leptogenesis in Polynomial Inflation", "abstract": "Polynomial inflation is a very simple and well motivated scenario. A potential with a concave ``almost'' saddle point at field value $\\phi = \\phi_0$ fits well the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and makes testable predictions for the running of the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio. In this work we analyze leptogenesis in the polynomial inflation framework. We delineate the allowed parameter space giving rise to the correct baryon asymmetry as well as being consistent with data on neutrino oscillations. To that end we consider two different reheating scenarios. $(i)$ If the inflaton decays into two bosons, the reheating temperature can be as high as $T_\\text{rh} \\sim 10^{14}$ GeV without spoiling the flatness of the potential, allowing vanilla $N_1$ thermal leptogenesis to work if $T_\\text{rh}> M_1$ where $N_1$ is the lightest right--handed neutrino and $M_1$ its mass. Moreover, if the dominant decay of the inflaton is into Higgs bosons of the Standard Model, we find that rare three--body inflaton decays into a Higgs boson plus one light and one heavy neutrino allow leptogenesis even for $T_\\text{rh} < M_1$ if the inflaton mass is of order $10^{12}$ GeV or higher; in the polynomial inflation scenario this requires $\\phi_0 \\gtrsim 2.5~M_P$. This novel mechanism of non--thermal leptogenesis is quite generic, since the coupling leading to the three--body final state is required in the type I see--saw mechanism. $(ii)$ If the inflaton decays into two fermions, the flatness of the potential implies a lower reheating temperature. In this case inflaton decay to two $N_1$ still allows successful non--thermal leptogenesis if $\\phi_0 \\gtrsim 0.1~M_P$ and $T_\\text{rh} \\gtrsim 10^{6}$ GeV.", "authors": "Manuel Drees, Yong Xu", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Production of s-process elements in AGB stars as revealed by Gaia GSP-spec abundances", "abstract": "The recent parameterisation by the GSP-spec module of Gaia/RVS spectra has produced an homogeneous catalogue of about 174,000 AGB stars. Among the 13 chemical elements presented in this catalogue, the abundance of 2 of them (Ce and Nd) have been estimated in most of these AGBs. These 2 species formed by slow n-captures in the interior of low- and intermediate-mass stars, belong to the family of 2nd-peak s-process elements. We defined a working sample of 19,544 AGB stars with high-quality Ce and/or Nd abundances, selected by applying a specific combination of the GSP-spec quality flags. We compared these abundances with the yield production predicted by AGB stars evolutionary models. We found a good correlation between the Ce and Nd abundances, confirming the high quality of the derived abundances and that these species indeed belong to the same s-process family. We also found higher Ce and Nd abundances for more evolved AGB stars of similar metallicity, illustrating the successive mixing episodes enriching the AGB star surface. We then compared the observed Ce and Nd abundances with the FRUITY and Monash AGB yields and found that the higher Ce and Nd abundances cannot be explained by AGB stars of masses higher than 5Msun. In contrast, the yields predicted by both models for AGB stars with an initial mass between ~1.5 and ~2.5Mssun and metallicities between ~-0.5 and ~0.0dex are fully compatible with the observed GSP-spec abundances. This work based on the largest catalogue of high-quality second-peak s-element abundances in O-rich AGB stars allows evolutionary models to be constrained and confirms the fundamental role played by low- and intermediate-mass stars in the enrichment of the Universe in these chemical species.", "authors": "G.

We consider a hybrid approach in which the equation of state (EoS) comprises a cold, zero temperature, piecewise-polytropic part and a thermal part described by an ideal gas, and a tabulated approach based on self-consistent, microphysical, finite-temperature EoS. We use time-domain waveforms corresponding to BNS merger simulations with four different EoS. Those are injected into Gaussian noise given by the sensitivity of the third-generation detector Einstein Telescope and reconstructed using BayesWave, a Bayesian data-analysis algorithm that recovers the signals through a model-agnostic approach. The two representations of thermal effects result in frequency shifts of the dominant peaks in the spectra of the post-merger signals, for both the quadrupole fundamental mode and the late-time inertial modes. For some of the EoS investigated those differences are large enough to be told apart, especially in the early post-merger phase when the signal amplitude is the loudest. These frequency shifts may result in differences in the inferred tidal deformability, which might be resolved by third-generation detectors up to distances of about tens of Mpc at most.", "authors": "Miquel Miravet-Tenés, Davide Guerra, Milton Ruiz, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, José A.

The generalized solutions assume a material model with power law temperature dependent opacities and a material energy density which is proportional to the radiation energy density, as well as a surface radiation temperature drive which obeys a temporal power-law. The solutions are analyzed in detail and it is shown that they take various qualitatively different forms according to the values of the opacity exponents. The solutions are used to construct a set of standardized benchmarks for supersonic non-equilibrium radiative heat transfer, which are nontrivial but straightforward to implement.

Among the pulsars observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, PSR B1916+14 has a large number of isolated well-resolved subpulses in the high time resolution observations, having a typical width of 0.15 ms and a high linear polarization. We find that the number distribution of subpulses contributes dominantly to the mean profile. According to the emission geometry, these emission units come from a region roughly 155 km above the polar cap in the pulsar magnetosphere, and the length scale of basic emission units is approximately 120 m. The deviations of polarization position angles for these single subpulses from the standard S-shaped curve are closely related to their fractional linear and circular polarization, and the large deviations tend to come from drifting subpulses.", "authors": "Tao Wang, C.

We numerically calculate the angular power spectrum of the lensing potential and the lensed CMB anisotropy of temperature, E-mode, and B-mode polarization, including the nonlinear effects of EFHs. We find the possibility that the lensed CMB temperature anisotropy is significantly enhanced on small scales, $\\ell>1000$, and could be tested by component decomposition of observed signals through multi-frequency observations. Through the calculation with different models of the spiky-type power spectrum, we demonstrate that the accurate measurements of the CMB lensing effect would provide insight into the abundance of EFHs within the limited mass range around $10^{12}M_\\odot$ and the primordial power spectrum on the limited scales around $k\\sim 1\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In particular, we find that the existence of such EFHs can amplify the lensed anisotropy of CMB B-mode polarization even on large scales, $\\ell <100$, as the overall enhancement by $\\sim 10 \\%$ level compared to the standard structure formation model without EFHs. Therefore, future CMB measurements such as the LiteBIRD satellite can probe the existence of the EFHs and the spike-type primordial power spectrum through the precise measurement of the large-scale CMB B-mode polarization.", "authors": "Katsuya T.

X-ray line emission in these systems can be produced by different processes, e.g. low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud and fast ejecta fragments moving in the cloud. The paper aims at studying the origin of the non-thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006 beyond the main shock, in order to distinguish if the emission is due to low energy cosmic rays diffusing in the cloud or to ejecta knots moving into the cloud. We analyzed the X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, where the remnant interacts with an atomic cloud, with three different X-ray telescopes ({NuSTAR, Chandra and XMM-Newton) and performed a combined spectro-imaging analysis of this region. The analysis of the non thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, interacting with an atomic cloud, has shown the detection of an extended X-ray source in the atomic cloud, approximately $2$ pc upstream of the shock front. The source is characterized by a hard continuum (described by a power law with photon index $\\Gamma\\sim1.4$) and by Ne, Si and Fe emission lines. The observed flux suggests that the origin of the X-ray emission is not associated with low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud.

Employing the two-fluid formalism, our analysis reveals that DM accrued within the NS core exerts an inward gravitational pull on the outer layers composed of BM. This gravitational interaction results in a noticeable increase in baryonic density within the core of the NS. Consequently, it strongly affects the star's thermal evolution by triggering an early onset of the direct Urca (DU) processes, causing an enhanced neutrino emission and rapid star cooling. Moreover, the photon emission from the star's surface is modified due to a reduction of radius. We demonstrate the effect of DM gravitational pull on nucleonic and hyperonic DU processes that become kinematically allowed even for NSs of low mass. We then discuss the significance of observing NSs at various distances from the Galactic center. Given that the DM distribution peaks toward the Galactic center, NSs within this central region are expected to harbor higher fractions of DM, potentially leading to distinct cooling behaviors.", "authors": "Edoardo Giangrandi, Afonso Ávila, Violetta Sagun, Oleksii Ivanytskyi, Constança Providência", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},

AX J1841.0-0536 was caught during the observational campaign at a relatively low flux.

{"title": "A Dependable Distance Estimator to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries", "abstract": "Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries (BH-LMXBs) is an excellent observational laboratory for studying many open questions in accretion physics. However, determining the physical properties of BH-LMXBs necessitates knowing their distances. With the increased discovery rate of BH-LMXBs, many canonical methods cannot produce accurate distance estimates at the desired pace. In this study, we develop a versatile statistical framework to obtain robust distance estimates soon after discovery. Our framework builds on previous methods where the soft spectral state and the soft-to-hard spectral state transitions, typically present in an outbursting BH-LMXB, are used to place constraints on mass and distance. We further develop the traditional framework by allowing for general relativistic corrections, spectral/physical parameter uncertainties as well as utilizing assumptions based on the best current theoretical and observational knowledge. We tested our framework by analyzing a sample of 50 BH-LMXB sources using X-ray spectral data from the Swift/XRT, MAXI/GSC, and RXTE/PCA missions.

Comparison of our estimated distances to previous distance estimates indicates that our findings are dependable and in agreement with the accurate estimates obtained through parallax, and H i absorption methods. Investigating the accuracy of our constraints, we have found that estimates obtained using both the soft and transition spectral information have a median uncertainty of 20%, while estimates obtained using only the soft spectral state spectrum have a median uncertainty of around 50%.

{"title": "The impact of spectral line wing cut-off: Recommended standard method with application to MAESTRO opacity database", "abstract": "When computing cross-sections from a line list, the result depends not only on the line strength, but also the line shape, pressure-broadening parameters, and line wing cut-off (i.e., the maximum distance calculated from each line centre). Pressure-broadening can be described using the Lorentz lineshape, but it is known to not represent the true absorption in the far wings. Both theory and experiment have shown that far from the line centre, non-Lorentzian behaviour controls the shape of the wings and the Lorentz lineshape fails to accurately characterize the absorption, leading to an underestimation or overestimation of the opacity continuum depending on the molecular species involved. The line wing cut-off is an often overlooked parameter when calculating absorption cross sections, but can have a significant effect on the appearance of the spectrum since it dictates the extent of the line wing that contributes to the calculation either side of every line centre. Therefore, when used to analyse exoplanet and brown dwarf spectra, an inaccurate choice for the line wing cut-off can result in errors in the opacity continuum, which propagate into the modeled transit spectra, and ultimately impact/bias the interpretation of observational spectra, and the derived composition and thermal structure. Here, we examine the different methods commonly utilized to calculate the wing cut-off and propose a standard practice procedure (i.e., absolute value of 25~cm$^{-1}$ for $P\\leqslant$~200~bar and 100~cm$^{-1}$ for $P >$ ~200~bar) to generate molecular opacities which will be used by the open-access {\\tt MAESTRO} (Molecules and Atoms in Exoplanet Science: Tools and Resources for Opacities) database.

The data are high resolution, high signal to noise, and laser frequency comb calibrated, obtained using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. The high quality of the data and proximity of the regions motivate a differential comparison, exploring the possibility of spatial variations of fundamental constants, as predicted in some theories. We show that if the magnesium isotopic relative abundances are terrestrial, the fine structure constants in these two systems differ at the 7-sigma level. A 3-sigma discrepancy between the two measurements persists even for the extreme non-terrestrial case of 100% ^{24}Mg, if shared by both systems. However, if Mg isotopic abundances take independent values in these two proximate systems, one terrestrial, the other with no heavy isotopes, both can be reconciled with a terrestrial alpha, and the discrepancy between the two measurements falls to 2-sigma. We discuss varying constant and varying isotope interpretations and resolutions to this conundrum for future high precision measurements.", "authors": "John K.

{"title": "An insight into chromatic behaviour of jitter in pulsars and its modelling: A case study of PSR J0437$-$4715", "abstract": "Pulse-to-pulse profile shape variations introduce correlations in pulsar times of arrival (TOAs) across radio frequency measured at the same observational epoch. This leads to a broadband noise in excess of radiometer noise, which is termed pulse jitter noise. The presence of jitter noise limits the achievable timing precision and decreases the sensitivity of pulsar-timing data sets to signals of interest such as nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves. Current white noise models used in pulsar timing analyses attempt to account for this, assuming complete correlation of uncertainties through the arrival times collected in a unique observation and no frequency dependence of jitter (which corresponds to a rank-one covariance matrix). However, previous studies show that the brightest millisecond pulsar at decimetre wavelengths, PSR J0437$-$4715, shows decorrelation and frequency dependence of jitter noise. Here we present a detailed study of the decorrelation of jitter noise in PSR J0437$-$4715 and implement a new technique to model it. We show that the rate of decorrelation due to jitter can be expressed as a power-law in frequency. We analyse the covariance matrix associated with the jitter noise process and find that a higher-rank-approximation is essential to account for the decorrelation and to account for frequency dependence of jitter noise. We show that the use of this novel method significantly improves the estimation of other chromatic noise parameters such as dispersion measure variations. However, we find no significant improvement in errors and estimation of other timing model parameters suggesting that current methods are not biased for other parameters, for this pulsar due to this misspecification. We show that pulse energy variations show a similar decorrelation to the jitter noise, indicating a common origin for both observables.", "authors": "A. D. Kulkarni, R. M. Shannon, D. J. Reardon, M.

While the basic phenomenon is a straightforward consequence of general relativity, there are many non-obvious consequences that make multiple-image lensing systems (aka strong gravitational lenses) remarkable astrophysical probes in several different ways. This article is an introduction to the essential concepts and terminology in this area, emphasizing physical insight. The key construct is the Fermat potential or arrival-time surface: from it the standard lens equation, and the notions of image parities, magnification, critical curves, caustics, and degeneracies all follow. The advantages and limitations of the usual simplifying assumptions (geometrical optics, small angles, weak fields, thin lenses) are noted, and to the extent possible briefly, it is explained how to go beyond these. Some less well-known ideas are discussed at length: arguments using wavefronts show that much of the theory carries over unchanged to the regime of strong gravitational fields; saddle-point contours explain how even the most complicated image configurations are made up of just two ingredients. Orders of magnitude, and the question of why strong lensing is most common for objects at cosmological distance, are also discussed. The challenges of lens modeling, and diverse strategies developed to overcome them, are discussed in general terms, without many technical details.", "authors": "Prasenjit Saha, Dominique Sluse, Jenny Wagner, Liliya L.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a common hypervolatile in comets that can drive activity but is more difficult to study than other hypervolatiles due to severe telluric absorption. CO2 can only be directly observed from space-borne assets. Therefore, a proxy is needed to measure CO2 abundances in comets using ground-based observations. The flux ratio of the [O I] 5577 A line to the sum of the [O I] 6300 A and [O I] 6364 A lines (hereafter referred to as the [O I] line ratio) has, with some success, been used in the past as such a proxy. We present an [O I] line ratio analysis of comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdušáková (HMP), using data obtained with the Tull Coudé Spectrograph on the 2.7-meter Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory, taken from UT February 21-23, 2017 when the comet was at heliocentric distances of 1.12-1.15 AU. HMP is a hyperactive Jupiter family comet (JFC). Icy grains driven out by CO2 sublimation have been proposed as a driver of hyperactivity, but the CO2 abundance of HMP has not been measured. From our [O I] line ratio measurements, we find a CO2/H2O ratio for HMP of 22.9 +/- 1.4%. We compare the CO2/H2O ratios to the active fractions of the nine comets (including HMP) in the literature that have data for both values. We find no correlation. These findings imply that CO2 sublimation driving out icy grains is not the only factor influencing active fractions for cometary nuclei.", "authors": "Mikayla R. Huffman, Adam J. McKay, Anita L.

The Orion Bar because of its edge-on geometry provides an exceptional benchmark for characterizing dust evolution and the associated driving processes under varying physical conditions. Our goal is to constrain the local properties of dust by comparing its emission to models. Taking advantage of the recent JWST PDRs4All data, we follow the dust emission as traced by JWST NIRCam (at 3.35 and 4.8 micron) and MIRI (at 7.7, 11.3, 15.0, and 25.5 micron), along with NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations. First, we constrain the minimum size and hydrogen content of carbon nano-grains from a comparison between the observed dust emission spectra and the predictions of the THEMIS dust model coupled to the numerical code DustEM. Using this dust model, we then perform 3D radiative transfer simulations of dust emission with the SOC code and compare to data obtained along well chosen profiles across the Orion Bar. The JWST data allows us, for the first time, to spatially resolve the steep variation of dust emission at the illuminated edge of the Orion Bar PDR. By considering a dust model with carbonaceous nano-grains and submicronic coated silicate grains, we derive unprecedented constraints on the properties of across the Orion Bar. To explain the observed emission profiles with our simulations, we find that the nano-grains must be strongly depleted with an abundance (relative to the gas) 15 times less than in the diffuse ISM. The NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations reveal variations in the hydrogenation of the carbon nano-grains. The lowest hydrogenation levels are found in the vicinity of the illuminating stars suggesting photo-processing while more hydrogenated nano-grains are found in the cold and dense molecular region, potentially indicative of larger grains.", "authors": "M.

{"title": "Metastability of stratified magnetohydrostatic equilibria and their relaxation", "abstract": "Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear convective stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in 2D. We demonstrate that, unlike the Schwarzschild criterion in hydrodynamics (``entropy must increase upwards for convective stability''), the so-called modified Schwarzschild criterion for 2D MHD (or for any kind of fluid dynamics with more than one source of pressure) guarantees only linear stability. As a result, in 2D MHD (unlike in hydrodynamics) there exist metastable equilibria that are unstable to nonlinear perturbations despite being stable to linear ones. We show that the minimum-energy configurations attainable by these atmospheres via non-diffusive reorganization can be determined by solving a combinatorial optimization problem. We find inter alia that these minimum-energy states are usually 2D, even when the original metastable equilibrium was 1D. We demonstrate with direct numerical simulations that these 2D states are fairly accurate predictors of the final state reached by laminar relaxation of metastable equilibria at small Reynolds number. To describe relaxation at large Reynolds number, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximization of Boltzmann's mixing entropy that is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of self-gravitating systems and collisionless plasmas, and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. The minimum-energy states described above are, we show, the low-temperature limit of this theory.

Numerical reproduction of this process is therefore essential for developing robust solar models. Our goal is to assess plasmoid-mediated reconnection across various numerical resistivity models in order to investigate how plasmoid numbers and reconnection rates depend on the Lundquist number. We used the Bifrost code to drive magnetic reconnection in a 2D coronal fan-spine topology, carrying out a parametric study of several experiments with different numerical resolution and resistivity models. We employed three anomalous resistivity models: (1) the original hyper-diffusion from Bifrost, (2) a resistivity proportional to current density, and (3) a resistivity quadratically proportional to electron drift velocity. For comparisons, experiments with uniform resistivity were also run. Plasmoid-mediated reconnection is obtained in most of the experiments. With uniform resistivity, increasing the resolution reveals higher plasmoid frequency with weaker scaling to the Lundquist number, obtaining 7.9-12 plasmoids per minute for $S_L\\in[1.8 \\times 10^4, 2.6\\times 10^5]$ with a scaling of $S_L^{0.210}$ in the highest-resolution resistivity cases, transcending into Petschek reconnection in the high-$S_L$ limit and Sweet-Parker reconnection in the low-$S_L$ limit. Anomalous resistivity leads to similar results even with lower resolution. The drift-velocity-dependent resistivity excellently reproduces Petschek reconnection for any Lundquist number, and similar results are seen with resistivity proportional to current-density. Among the different resistivity models applied on the given numerical resolution, the hyper-diffusion model reproduced plasmoid characteristics in closest resemblance to those obtained with uniform resistivity at a significantly higher resolution.", "authors": "Øystein Håvard Færder, Daniel Nóbrega-Siverio, Mats Carlsson", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

In this work we investigate the effects of dark energy on the internal structure of a neutron star composed of two phases, which leads us to wonder: Do stable neutron stars have a dark-energy core? To address this question, we focus on the radial stability of stellar configurations composed by a dark-energy core -- described by a Chaplygin-type equation of state (EoS) -- and an ordinary-matter external layer which is described by a polytropic EoS. We examine the impact of the rate of energy densities at the phase-splitting surface, defined as $\\alpha= \\rho_{\\rm dis}^-/\\rho_{\\rm dis}^+$, on the radius, total gravitational mass and oscillation spectrum. The resulting mass-radius diagrams are notably different from dark energy stars without a common-matter crust. Specifically, it is found that both the mass and the radius of the maximum-mass configuration decrease as $\\alpha$ becomes smaller. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions for mass-radius relations consistently describe the observational measurements of different massive millisecond pulsars as well as the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347. The analysis of the normal oscillation modes reveals that there are two regions of instability on the $M(\\rho_c)$ curve when $\\alpha$ is small enough indicating that the usual stability criterion $dM/d\\rho_c>0$ still holds for rapid phase transitions.

In this work, we investigate its structural stability using an advanced soft-sphere-discrete-element-model code, DEMBody, which is integrated with bonded-aggregate models to simulate highly irregular boulders. The asteroid body is numerically constructed by tens of thousands particles, and then is slowly spin up until structural failure. Rubble piles with different morphologies, grain size distributions and structures are investigated. We find a 2016 HO3 shaped granular asteroid would undergo tensile failure at higher cohesive strengths as opposed to shear failure in lower strengths, regardless of its shape and constituent grain size ratio. Such a failure mode transition is consistent with the priority between the Maximum Tensile Stress criterion criterion and the Drucker-Prager criterion. Therefore, previous works that solely considered the Drucker-Prager failure criterion have underestimated the minimal cohesion strength required for fast-rotating asteroids. We predict that the high spin rate of asteroid 2016 HO3 requires a surface cohesion over ~1 Pa and a bulk cohesion over ~10-20 Pa. Through comparing these strength conditions with the latest data from asteroid missions, we suggest a higher likelihood of a monolithic structure over a typical rubble pile structure.

To complete this picture, it is important to investigate the dependence on metallicity of the chemical ratios employed for inferring stellar ages. We aim to explore different combinations of neutron-capture, odd-Z and $\\alpha$ elements as a function of age, particularly focusing on their metallicity dependence for a sample of 74 giant field stars. Using UVES observations, we derive atmospheric parameters and high-precision line by line chemical abundances (<0.04 dex) for the entire set of spectra. Stellar ages are inferred from astereoseismic information. By fitting chemical-age trends for three different metallicity groups, we estimated their dependence on metallicity. We found that the stronger chemical-age relations ([Zr/$\\alpha$]) are not necessarily the ratios with the smaller dependence on metallicity ([Ce/$\\alpha$] and [Ce/Eu]). We confirm the [n-capture/$\\alpha$]-age trends for evolved stars, wherein the most significant correlation is evident in stars with solar-metallicity, gradually diminishing in stars with lower iron content. The lack of homogeneity within the metallicity range highlights the intricate nature of our Galaxy's star formation history and yield production. Metallicity dependence in s-process element yields and the impact of radial stellar migration challenge the reliability of using chemical abundances alone to date stars. These discoveries raise doubts about universally valid chemical clocks applicable across the entire Galaxy and its diverse metallicity ranges.", "authors": "S. Vitali, D. Slumstrup, P. Jofré, L.

The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background.

By utilizing 'Oumuamua's properties as an anchor, we estimate the mass and number density of ejecta in the ISM (rho_m [kg au^-3] and rho_n [au^-3]). We build upon prior work by first accounting for the minimum ejecta size to shield microbes from supernova radiation. Second, we estimate the total number of impact events C_n on Earth after its formation and prior to the emergence of life (~0.8Gyr). We derive a conditional probability relation for the likelihood of panspermia for Earth specifically of <10^-5, given a number of factors including f_B, the fraction of ejecta harboring extremophiles and other factors that are poorly constrained.

Instead, the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the locations of void galaxies is systematically lower than the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the dark matter (i.e., the voids are more ``devoid'' of galaxies than they are of mass). Within the voids, the integrated underdensity profiles of the dark matter and the galaxies are independent of the local background density (i.e., voids-in-voids vs.\\ voids-in-clouds). Beyond the void radii, however, the integrated underdensity profiles of both the dark matter and the galaxies exhibit strong dependencies on the local background density.

Recent work has shown that deep-forming spectral lines are subject to significant contributions from regions above the photosphere throughout the flaring period, resulting in a composite emergent intensity profile from multiple layers of the atmosphere. We employ radiative-hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations to simulate the response of the solar/stellar atmosphere to electron beam heating and synthesize spectral lines of Fe I to investigate the line-of-sight velocity fields information available from Doppler shifts of the emergent intensity profile. By utilizing the contribution function to deconstruct the line profile shape into its constituent sources, we show that variations in the line profiles are primarily caused by changes in the chromosphere. Up-flows in this region were found to create blueshifts or \"false\" redshifts in the line core dependent on the relative contribution of the chromosphere compared to the photosphere. In extreme solar and stellar flare scenarios featuring explosive chromospheric condensations, red-shifted transient components can dominate the temporal evolution of the profile shape, requiring a tertiary component consideration to fully characterize.

We investigated the effect of transverse structuring on the processes of mode conversion and wave energy flux absorption using a 3D ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation featuring an expanding coronal loop in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Methods. Multiple wave drivers were modelled. The location of the driver at the photospheric base was allowed to vary so that we could study how the driven waves interact with the transverse structuring, provided by the magnetic field, as well as with the vertical structuring due to gravity. Results. We find that the transverse structuring acts as a conduit for Alfvén wave energy flux through the transition region and into the solar corona. Moreover, in regions of strong transverse gradients, the reflection of Alfvén waves at the transition region is greatly reduced, supporting results from recent studies. Finally, we investigated the efficiency of the loop structuring at absorbing energy flux from externally driven waves and find that the loop is extremely effective at channelling wave energy flux to the loop apex in the corona; in some cases, it can absorb over a third of the externally driven wave energy flux.

The resulting sample was divided based on group richness. To quantify the effects of rings and the role of local density environment on galaxy properties, we constructed a suitable control sample for each catalog of ringed galaxies, consisting of non-ringed galaxies with similar values for the z, magnitude, morphology, group masses, and environmental density distributions as those of ringed ones.

We obtained a sample of 637 ringed galaxies residing in groups. With 76% of these galaxies inhabiting poor groups and 24% rich groups. In addition, ringed galaxies in groups display a reduction in their star formation activity and aged stellar populations, compared to non-ringed ones in the control samples. However, the SFR is higher for nuclear rings in poor groups than for other types. This disparity may stem from the environmental influence on the internal processes of galaxies, either enhancing or diminishing star formation. Ringed galaxies also show an excess of red colors and tend to populate the green valley and the red sequence of color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, with a surplus of galaxies in the red sequence, while non-ringed galaxies are found in the green valley and the blue region.

Dust dynamics and growth are also included in the simulations. Results. We found that the dust growth from $\\sim 1~\\mu$m to 1-10~mm already occurs in the initial few thousand years of disk evolution but the Stokes number hardly exceeds 0.1 because of higher disk densities and temperatures compared to the minimum mass Solar nebular. The ratio of the dust-to-gas vertical scale heights remains rather modest, 0.2--0.5, which may be explained by the perturbing action of spiral arms that develop in the disk soon after its formation. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in the disk midplane is highly nonhomogeneous throughout the disk extent and is in general enhanced by a factor of several compared to the fiducial 1:100 value. Low St hinders strong dust accumulation in the spiral arms compared to the rest of the disk and the nonsteady nature of the spirals is also an obstacle.

For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid star EoS is generated by varying the transition density from nucleonic to quark matter, the density jump at the transition, and the speed-of-sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS and PSR J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EoS models which predict low-mass twin stars with masses $M \\lesssim 1.3\\,M_{\\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with a large speed-of-sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in the range $2.0$-$2.6\\,M_{\\odot}$.", "authors": "Jia Jie Li, Armen Sedrakian, Mark Alford", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Gravitational waves from neutron-star mountains", "abstract": "Rotating neutron stars that support long-lived, non-axisymmetric deformations known as mountains have long been considered potential sources of gravitational radiation. However, the amplitude from such a source is very weak and current gravitational-wave interferometers have yet to witness such a signal. The lack of detections has provided upper limits on the size of the involved deformations, which are continually being constrained. With expected improvements in detector sensitivities and analysis techniques, there is good reason to anticipate an observation in the future. This review concerns the current state of the theory of neutron-star mountains. These exotic objects host the extreme regimes of modern physics, which are related to how they sustain mountains. We summarise various mechanisms that may give rise to asymmetries, including crustal strains built up during the evolutionary history of the neutron star, the magnetic field distorting the star's shape and accretion episodes gradually constructing a mountain. Moving beyond the simple rotating model, we also discuss how precession affects the dynamics and modifies the gravitational-wave signal. We describe the prospects for detection and the challenges moving forward.", "authors": "Fabian Gittins", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A Generalized Variable Projection Algorithm for Least Squares Problems in Atmospheric Remote Sensing", "abstract": "This paper presents a solution for efficiently and accurately solving separable least squares problems with multiple datasets. These problems involve determining linear parameters that are specific to each dataset while ensuring that the nonlinear parameters remain consistent across all datasets. A well-established approach for solving such problems is the variable projection algorithm introduced by Golub and LeVeque, which effectively reduces a separable problem to its nonlinear component. However, this algorithm assumes that the datasets have equal sizes and identical auxiliary model parameters. This article is motivated by a real-world remote sensing application where these assumptions do not apply. Consequently, we propose a generalized algorithm that extends the original theory to overcome these limitations. The new algorithm has been implemented and tested using both synthetic and real satellite data for atmospheric carbon dioxide retrievals. It has also been compared to conventional state-of-the-art solvers, and its advantages are thoroughly discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms all other methods in terms of computation time, while maintaining comparable accuracy and stability. Hence, this novel method can have a positive impact on future applications in remote sensing and could be valuable for other scientific fitting problems with similar properties.", "authors": "Adelina Bärligea, Philipp Hochstaffl, Franz Schreier", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

The recent evidence of SGWB by pulsar timing arrays in the nanohertz band is a breakthrough in the GW astronomy. For ground-based GW detectors, while unfortunately in data analysis the SGWB can be masked by loud GW events from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). Assuming a next-generation ground-based GW detector network, we investigate the potential for detecting the astrophysical and cosmological SGWB with non-CBC origins by subtracting recovered foreground signals of loud CBC events. As an extension of the studies by Sachdev et al. (2020) and Zhou et al. (2023), we incorporate aligned spin parameters in our waveform model. Because of the inclusion of spins, we obtain significantly more pessimistic results than the previous work, where the residual energy density of foreground is even larger than the original background. The degeneracy between the spin parameters and symmetric mass ratio is strong in the parameter estimation process and it contributes most to the imperfect foreground subtraction. Our results have important implications for assessing the detectability of SGWB from non-CBC origins for ground-based GW detectors.", "authors": "Hanlin Song, Dicong Liang, Ziming Wang, Lijing Shao", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

Considering the third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, Einstein Telescope and two Cosmic Explorers, we simulate a series of GW events of binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) binary with EM counterparts. These simulations can be used to constrain $f(T)$ gravity (specially the Power-law model $f(T)=T+\\alpha(-T)^\\beta$ in this work) and other cosmological parameters, such as $\\beta$ and Hubble constant.

{"title": "Observations on the massive particle surface method", "abstract": "The geodesic method has played a crucial role in understanding the circular orbits generated by compact objects, culminating in the definition of the photon sphere, which was later generalized to a photon surface in arbitrary spacetimes. This new formulation extends the concept of the photon sphere in a broader sense, including dynamical spacetimes, as shown by the Vaidya solution. The photon surface essentially defines the null geodesics, which are originally tangent to the temporal surface, and keeps them confined to this surface. However, this formalism does not cover all classes of particles, and to overcome this limitation, a more comprehensive approach, denoted as the \"massive particle surface\", has been proposed that also accounts for charged massive particles. Indeed, the photon surface concept is recovered when the charge and mass of the particles are zero. In this work, we use these three formalisms to check the consistency of the results for the values of the radius of the photon sphere ($r_{ps}$) and the radius of the \"innermost stable circular orbit\" (ISCO) ($r_{\\rm ISCO}$) for some gravitational models. In our results, the first model is described by conformal gravity, with the peculiarity that $g_{00}\\neq-g_{11}^{-1}$. The second model, i.e. the Culetu solution, is developed by coupling General Relativity with nonlinear electrodynamics, which requires the consideration of the effective metric ($g_{\\rm eff}^{\\mu\\nu}$) for geodesic approaches. Furthermore, we have also analysed the expressions for $r_{ps}$ and $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ in a general static and spherically symmetric metric.

{"title": "Thermal leptogenesis in the presence of helical hypermagnetic fields", "abstract": "One of the major challenges in particle physics and cosmology is understanding why there is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the Universe. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is thermal leptogenesis, which involves the addition of at least two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to the standard model. Another possible explanation is baryogenesis through the hypermagnetic fields which involves the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly and helical hypermagnetic fields in the early Universe. In this paper, after reviewing the thermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly, we investigate the simplest model that combines these two scenarios and explore the parameter space for optimal results. Our results show that the combined scenario permits a specific region of parameter space that is not covered by either one separately. In fact, the minimum required mass scale of the RHN and strength of initial hypermagnetic helicity are reduced by one order of magnitude in our model. Moreover, we find that in the combined scenario, leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly can either amplify or reduce the effect of each other, i.e., the generated asymmetry, depending on the sign of the helical hypermagnetic fields. Finally, we show the surprising result that a drastic amplification can occur even when the initial abundance of RHN is its equilibrium value for leptogenesis.", "authors": "Sahar Safari, Mehran Dehpour, Saeed Abbaslu, Siamak Sadat Gousheh", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

We employ the linear-sigma model as the low-energy description of dark many flavor QCD and show that the model undergoes ultra-supercooling due to the produced strong first-order thermal phase transition along the (approximately realized) flat direction based on the Gildener-Weinberg mechanism. Passing through evaluation of the bubble nucleation/percolation, we address the reheating and relaxation processes, which are generically non-thermal and nonadiabatic. Parametrizing the reheating epoch in terms of the efolding number, we propose proper formulae for the redshift effects on the GW frequencies and signal spectra. It then turns out that the ultra-supercooling predicted from the Higgs-portal scalegenesis generically yields none of GW signals with the frequencies as low as nano Hz, instead, prefers to give the higher frequency signals, which still keeps the future prospected detection sensitivity, like at LISA, BBO, and DECIGO, etc. We also find that with large flavors in the dark sector, the GW signals are made further smaller and the peak frequencies higher.

{"title": "The Intrinsic Energy Resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) Crystal for GECAM", "abstract": "The intrinsic resolution is the primary limitation on the total energy resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal. This intrinsic resolution arises from two effects: fluctuations occurring in the process of energy transfer to luminescent centers within the LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal and the LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal's non-proportional luminescence. Presently, experimental measurements regarding the intrinsic resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal are scarce, and the underlying physical mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we aim to elucidate the concept of intrinsic resolution. We investigated the entire physical process of luminescence following energy deposition in the LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal, quantifying the various components in the total energy resolution. We conducted a series of experimental measurements and Geant4 simulations, determining the intrinsic resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal to 100 keV electrons as 2.12%. The non-proportionality contributes significantly at 1.43%, while fluctuations in the energy transfer process accounted for 0.27%. It is evident that non-proportionality in light output constitutes the primary source of intrinsic resolution. Horizontal and vertical unevenness in light collection contributed 0.25% and 0.07%, respectively. Statistical fluctuations showed the largest impact on the total energy resolution, at 2.86%. The contribution from fluctuations in single-photoelectron events was 0.77%.

The late F-type host star has been hypothesized to be surrounded by a large structure of circumstellar material evaporated from the planet. We obtained two high-resolution spectral transit time series with CARMENES and extensively searched for absorption signals by the atomic species Na, H, Ca, and He using transmission spectroscopy, thereby covering the He I triplet with high resolution for the first time. We apply SYSREM for atomic line transmission spectroscopy, introduce the technique of signal protection to improve the results for individual absorption lines, and compare the outcomes to those of established methods. No transmission signals were detected and the most stringent upper limits as of yet were derived for the individual indicators. Nonetheless, we found variation in the stellar Halpha and He I lines, the origin of which remains uncertain but is unlikely to be activity. To constrain the enigmatic activity state of WASP-12, we analyzed XMM-Newton X-ray data and found the star to be moderately active at most. We deduced an upper limit for the X-ray luminosity and the irradiating X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux of WASP-12 b. Based on the XUV flux upper limit and the lack of the He I signal, our hydrodynamic models slightly favor a moderately irradiated planet with a thermospheric temperature of <= 12,000 K, and a conservative upper limit of <= 4e12 g/s on the mass-loss rate.

Although it has previously been classified as an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX), we show that its luminosity rarely, if ever, passes the $10^{39} \\rm ~erg~s^{-1}$ threshold luminosity for a ULX. It does, however, behave very similarly to ULXs, with its 0.3-10 keV spectra well described by two thermal components, the softer of which behaves consistently with the expectations for an advection-dominated disc ($L\\propto T^{1.49\\pm0.85}$), and we find tentative evidence for an extra spectral component above 10 keV.

{"title": "Dark Matter Influence on Quarkyonic Stars: A Relativistic Mean Field Analysis", "abstract": "The formulation of quarkyonic matter consists of treating both quarks and nucleons as quasi-particles, where a cross-over transition occurs between the two phases. This work is based upon some of the early ideas of quark matter. It can satisfy the different observational constraints on the neutron star (NS), such as its maximum mass and the canonical radius. In addition, we put an extra component inside the NS known as Dark Matter (DM) because it is trapped due to its immense gravitational potential. In this work, we explore the impact of fermionic DM on the structure of the NS. The equation of state (EOS) is derived for the NS with the quarkyonic matter by assuming that nucleons and quarks are in equilibrium, followed by the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism. The recently modeled two parameterizations, such as G3 and IOPB-I, are taken to calculate the various macroscopic properties of the NS. The three unknown parameters such as the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\\Lambda_{\\rm sc}$), and the DM Fermi momentum ($k_f^{\\rm DM}$) are varied to obtain the NS properties. The quarkyonic matter stiffens the EOS while DM softens it. The mutual combination provides us with good theoretical predictions for the magnitude of macroscopic properties consistent with the different observational results. Also, one can estimate the parameters of the DM admixed quarkyonic star with different statistical analyses, which can be further used to explore the other properties of the quarkyonic star.", "authors": "D.

Visually, they appear as bright patches of typically 15 to 30 m across whose large reflectances and spectral slopes in the visible substantiate the presence of sub-surface water ice. Using a new high-resolution photogrammetric shape model we determined the three-dimensional shape of these cavities whose depth ranges from 20 to 47 m. Spectral slopes were interpreted with models combining water ice and refractory dark material and the water ice abundances in the cavities were found to amount to a few per cent. The determination of the lifetime of the icy cavities was strongly biased by the availability of appropriate and favourable observations, but we found evidences of values of up to two years. The icy cavities were found to be connected to jets well documented in past studies. A thermal model allowed us to track their solar insolation over a large part of the orbit of the comet and a transitory bright jet on 2015 July 18 was unambiguously linked to the brief illumination of the icy bottom of one of the three cavities.

Magnetic field extrapolation show that the MF was enclosed by a fan-spine magnetic structure. The MF was activated by flux cancellation under it, and then slowly rose. A BCS formed when the magnetic fields wrapping the MF squeezed to antidirectional external open fields. Simultaneously, one thin bright jet and two bidirectional jet-like structures were observed. As the MF erupted as a blowout jet, a FCS was formed when the two distended legs inside the MF field came together. One end of the FCS connected the post-flare loops. The peak temperature of BCS was calculated to be 2.5 MK. The length, width and peak temperature of FCS was calculated to be 4.35-4.93 Mm, 1.31-1.45 Mm, and 2.5 MK, respectively. The magnetic reconnection rate associated with the FCS was estimated to be from 0.266 to 0.333. This event also related to a type III radio burst, indicating its influence on interplanetary space. These observations support the scenario of the breakout model as the trigger mechanism of coronal jets, and flux cancellation was the driver of this event.", "authors": "Liheng Yang, Xiaoli Yan, Zhike Xue, Zhe Xu, Qingmin Zhang, Yijun Hou, Jincheng Wang, Huadong Chen", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

Our observations revealed that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) exhibited strong emission bands of CN, C$_2$, C$_3$, and NH$_2$ which are superimposed on a dust scattering continuum, typical of cometary spectra in the optical. The production rates of CN, C$_2$, and C$_3$ derived using the Haser model and the corresponding C$_2$/CN and C$_3$/CN ratios suggest that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is a ``typical'' Oort cloud comet under the A'Hearn classification, although it appears less dusty as revealed by the $Af\\rho$ quantities. Its dust-scattering reflectivity is slightly red, with a gradient of $\\sim$5% per $10^3\\,{\\rm\\mathring{A}}$.

The cluster sample is constructed from the combined SPT-SZ, SPTpol ECS, and SPTpol 500d surveys, and comprises 1,005 confirmed clusters in the redshift range $0.25-1.78$ over a total sky area of 5,200 deg$^2$. We use DES Year 3 weak-lensing data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z<0.95$ and HST weak-lensing data for 39 clusters with $0.6<z<1.7$. The weak-lensing measurements enable robust mass measurements of sample clusters and allow us to empirically constrain the SZ observable--mass relation. For a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and marginalizing over the sum of massive neutrinos, we measure $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=0.286\\pm0.032$, $\\sigma_8=0.817\\pm0.026$, and the parameter combination $\\sigma_8\\,(\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.25}=0.805\\pm0.016$.

MMA/TDA is poised for breakthrough discoveries in the coming decade. In much the same way that expanding beyond the optical bandpass revealed entirely new and unexpected discoveries, cosmic messengers beyond light (i.e., gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays) open entirely new windows to answer some of the most fundamental questions in (astro)physics: heavy element synthesis, equation of state of dense matter, particle acceleration, etc. This field was prioritized as a frontier scientific pursuit in the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics via its \"New Windows on the Dynamic Universe\" theme. MMA/TDA science presents technical challenges distinct from those experienced in other disciplines. Successful observations require coordination across myriad boundaries -- different cosmic messengers, ground vs. space, international borders, etc. -- all for sources that may not be well localized, and whose brightness may be changing rapidly with time. Add that all of this work is undertaken by real human beings, with distinct backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and expectations, that often conflict. To address these challenges and help MMA/TDA realize its full scientific potential in the coming decade (and beyond), the second in a series of community workshops sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA titled \"Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-Messenger Ecosystem\" was held on October 16-18, 2023 in Tucson, AZ.

{"title": "Analytic relations assessing the impact of precursor knowledge and key mission parameters on direct imaging survey yield", "abstract": "The Habitable Worlds Observatory will attempt to image Earth-sized planets in Habitable Zone orbits around nearby Sun-like stars. In this work we explore approximate analytic yield calculations for a future flagship direct imaging mission for a survey sample of uniformly distributed set of identical Sun-like stars. We consider the dependence of this exoplanet detection yield on factors such as eta_Earth, telescope diameter, total on-sky time, orbital phase and separation, inner working angle, flux contrast, desired signal-to-noise ratio, spectral resolution, and other factors. We consider the impact on yield and survey efficiency in the absence of and with precursor knowledge of the Earth-size analog exoplanets. In particular, for precursor knowledge we assume the exoplanet orbital phase at the time of observation can be optimized so as to only image the Earth-size analog exoplanet when it is outside the inner working angle. We find that the yield of flagship direct imaging missions such as Habitable Worlds Observatory will be inner-working angle limited for the estimated exoplanet yields, and will not be impacted by precursor knowledge given our assumptions presented herein. However, we find that the survey efficiency will be enhanced by precursor knowledge. We benchmark our analytic approximations against detailed simulations for coronagraphs and starshades carried out for the HabEx and LUVOIR missions concept studies, and find consistent conclusions. Our analytic relations thus provide quick estimates and derivatives of the impact of key mission parameter choices on exo-Earth yield when considering design trades that can supplement existing computational simulations.", "authors": "Peter Plavchan, John E.

Building upon previous investigations involving GMRT, VLA, and LOFAR data, our study focuses on two prominent extended radio relics at the north-west (NW) and south-east (SE) of the cluster core. By leveraging the high-resolution Chandra imaging, we have identified two distinct surface brightness edges at $\\sim$ 1 Mpc and 1.2 Mpc NW and SE of the cluster center, respectively, coinciding with the outer edges of both relics. Our temperature measurements hint the edges to be shock front edges. The Mach numbers, derived from the gas density jumps, yield $\\cal{M}_{\\rm SE}$ = 1.49$^{+0.22}_{-0.24}$ for the South Eastern shock and $\\cal{M}_{\\rm NW}$ = 1.41$^{+0.17}_{-0.19}$ for the North Western shock. Our estimated Mach numbers are remarkably smaller compared to those derived from radio observations ($\\cal{M}_{\\rm SE}$ = 2.3 and $\\cal{M}_{\\rm NW}$ = 2.4), highlighting the prevalence of a re-acceleration scenario over direct acceleration of electrons from the thermal pool.

The brighter sides in the top and bottom halves are on the opposite sides, which we attributed to shadows cast by a misaligned inner disk. Radiative transfer modeling of the system with a misaligned angle of 15~deg between the inner and outer disks well reproduced the observations. Additionally, we found an elevated brightness temperature of $^{12}$CO~(3-2) at $r\\sim30$~au on the brighter side in NIR wavelengths in the top half disk, which can be explained by the shadowing effect too.

{"title": "Formation of collisional ring galaxies in Milgromian dynamics", "abstract": "Ring galaxies are rare in the Universe. A head-on or off-centre collision between an intruder galaxy and a disc galaxy leads to a collisional ring galaxy (CRG) when the intruder-to-target mass ratio (ITMR) is over 0.1 in Newtonian dynamics. Within the framework of Milgromian dynamics, the strong equivalence principle is violated due to the presence of an external field. When two galaxies collide towards each other, the dynamical mass of the phantom dark halo in a galaxy is suppressed by the external field induced by the other galaxy. As a consequence of such suppression, the gravitational perturbation for the target galaxy introduced by a collision is weakened. In this case, a minor collision may not be capable of generating a CRG. In this work, we address this issue and perform a series of numerical simulations of collisions by tuning the values of ITMR. We find that the critical ITMR is 0.5 in MOND, which is much larger than that in Newtonian dynamics. The observed massive ring galaxies, such as Arp 147, can be effectively interpreted by CRGs in MOND. This interpretation does not necessitate the presence of dark matter halos for either the target or intruder galaxies. Moreover, for a larger inclination angle or a larger impact parameter, the off-centred ring structure is fainter. The larger critical ITMR indicates that it is harder to form a CRG in Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). To account for the observed ring structures of the NGC 922-like galaxies in MOND, it is necessary to invoke other scenarios than a dry minor collision.", "authors": "Li Ma, Xufen Wu", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

To investigate the origins of these HiVels, we classify them into four categories and consider the impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) potential on their backward-integration trajectories. Specifically, we find that one of the HiVels can track back to the Galactic Center, and three HiVels may originate from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). Furthermore, some HiVels appear to be ejected from the Galactic disk, while others formed within the Milky Way or have an extragalactic origin. Given that the LMC has a significant impact on the orbits of Sgr dSph, we examine the reported HiVels that originate from the Sgr dSph, with a few of them passing within the half-light radius of the Sgr dSph.", "authors": "Jiwei Liao, Cuihua Du, Mingji Deng, Dashuang Ye, Hefan Li, Yang Huang, Jianrong Shi, Jun Ma", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

Previously known in the nonhelical case of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence, we show that magnetic reconnection is important also in the fully helical case and is likely the agent responsible for the inverse transfer of energy. Again, in the fully helical case, we find that there is a similarity in power law decay exponents in both 2.5D and 3D simulations. To understand this intriguing similarity, we investigate the possible quasi-two-dimensionalization of the 3D system. We perform Minkowski functional analysis and find that the characteristic length scales of a typical magnetic structure in the system are widely different, suggesting the existence of local anisotropies. Finally, we provide a quasi-two-dimensional hierarchical merger model which recovers the relevant power law scalings. In the nonhelical case, we show that a helicity-based invariant cannot constrain the system, and the best candidate is still anastrophy or vector potential squared, which is consistent with the quasi-two-dimensionalization of the system.", "authors": "Shreya Dwivedi, Chandranathan Anandavijayan, Pallavi Bhat", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

The M0.8-0.2 ring is a region of gas and dust that has a circular morphology with a central depression. The dust polarization in the M0.8-0.2 ring implies a curved magnetic field that traces the ring-like structure of the cloud.

{"title": "Weakened Magnetic Braking in the Exoplanet Host Star 51 Peg", "abstract": "The consistently low activity level of the old solar analog 51 Peg not only facilitated the discovery of the first hot Jupiter, but also led to the suggestion that the star could be experiencing a magnetic grand minimum. However, the 50 year time series showing minimal chromospheric variability could also be associated with the onset of weakened magnetic braking (WMB), where sufficiently slow rotation disrupts cycling activity and the production of large-scale magnetic fields by the stellar dynamo, thereby shrinking the Alfven radius and inhibiting the efficient loss of angular momentum to magnetized stellar winds. In this Letter, we evaluate the magnetic evolutionary state of 51 Peg by estimating its wind braking torque. We use new spectropolarimetric measurements from the Large Binocular Telescope to reconstruct the large-scale magnetic morphology, we reanalyze archival X-ray measurements to estimate the mass-loss rate, and we detect solar-like oscillations in photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, yielding precise stellar properties from asteroseismology. Our estimate of the wind braking torque for 51 Peg clearly places it in the WMB regime, driven by changes in the mass-loss rate and the magnetic field strength and morphology that substantially exceed theoretical expectations.

Moreover, it has been proposed to be chaotic, potentially limiting our ability to predict neutrino flavor transformations in simulations. To address this issue, we explore how small flavor perturbations evolve within a narrow centimeter-scale region inside a NSM and a toy neutrino distribution. Our findings reveal that paths in the flavor state space of solutions with similar initial conditions diverge exponentially, exhibiting chaos. This inherent chaos makes the microscopic scales of neutrino flavor transformations unpredictable. However, the domain-averaged neutrino density matrix remains relatively stable, with chaos minimally affecting it. This particular property suggests that domain-averaged quantities remain reliable despite the exponential amplification of errors.", "authors": "Erick Urquilla, Sherwood Richers", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "All Puffed Up: Tidal Heating as an Ultra Diffuse Galaxy Formation Pathway", "abstract": "We present new follow-up observations of two ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), part of a total sample of five chosen for their distorted morphologies, suggestive of tidal influence. Using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys F555W and F814W imaging, we identify 8+/-2 globular clusters (GCs) in KUG 0203-Dw1 and 6+/-2 in KDG 013, abundances that are fairly typical for normal dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass. Jansky Very Large Array data reveal a clear HI detection of KUG 0203-Dw1 with a gas mass estimate of log(MHI/Msun) < 7.4 and evidence of active stripping by the host. HI gas is found near the location of KDG~013 but is likely unrelated to the UDG itself due to the morphology and the numerous gas tails within the host group. Given that these UDGs have GC abundances typical for galaxies at their luminosity, these findings suggest that they likely originated as normal dwarf galaxies that have been subjected to significant stripping and tidal heating, causing them to become more diffuse. These two UDGs complete a sample of five exhibiting tidal features in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey area (CFHTLS; ~150 sq deg), including UDGs with and without UV emission, indicative of recent star formation. Four UDGs in this sample, consistent with dwarfs `puffed-up' by tidal interactions, contrast with an outlier, suggesting a dwarf merger origin.

Here, for the first time, we report the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to extract the global 21cm signal characteristics from the composite all-sky averaged signal, including foreground and ionospheric effects such as refraction, absorption, and thermal emission from the ionosphere's F and D-layers. We assume a 'perfect' instrument and neglect instrumental calibration and beam effects. To model the ionospheric effect, we considered the static and time-varying ionospheric conditions for the mid-latitude region where LOFAR is situated. In this work, we trained the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for various situations using a synthetic set of the global 21cm signals created by altering its parameter space based on the \"$\\rm \\tanh$\" parameterized model and the Accelerated Reionization Era Simulations (ARES) algorithm.

We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower Eddington ratio ($f_{Edd}$) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a $f_{Edd}$ distribution that significantly differs from that of a redshift- and a carefully constructed, luminosity-matched control sample ($p_{KS}$ $\\lesssim$ 2 $\\times$ $10^{-4}$ ; median $f_{Edd}$ $\\approx$ 0.025 vs. 0.043). This preference for low $f_{Edd}$ strengthens previous findings of higher CL-AGN incidence at lower Eddington ratios, found in much smaller samples of spectroscopically confirmed CL-AGNs. Finally, we show that the broad MgII emission line in our CL-AGN sample tends to vary significantly less than the broad H$\\beta$ emission line. Our large CL-AGN sample demonstrates the advantages and challenges in using multi-epoch spectroscopy from large surveys to study extreme AGN variability, SMBH fueling, and AGN physics.", "authors": "Grisha Zeltyn, Benny Trakhtenbrot, Michael Eracleous, Qian Yang, Paul Green, Scott F.

In addition to representing the most-distant observed filament at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths -- captured by Solar Orbiter's field of view extending to above 6 $R_{\\odot}$ -- this event was also associated with the release of a fast ($\\sim$2200 km$\\cdot$s$^{-1}$) coronal mass ejection (CME) that was directed towards BepiColombo and Parker Solar Probe.

We analyse similarities and differences in the main CME-related structures measured at the two locations, namely the interplanetary shock, the sheath region, and the magnetic ejecta. We find that, despite the separation between the two spacecraft being well within the typical uncertainties associated with determination of CME geometric parameters from remote-sensing observations, the two sets of in-situ measurements display some profound differences that make understanding of the overall 3D CME structure particularly challenging.

W2246-0526 harbors a heavily obscured supermassive black hole that is most likely accreting above the Eddington limit. We present observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in seven bands, including band 10, of the brightest far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure emission lines of this galaxy: [OI]$_{63\\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\\mu m}$, [OI]$_{145\\mu m}$, [CII]$_{158\\mu m}$, [NII]$_{205\\mu m}$, [CI]$_{370\\mu m}$, and [CI]$_{609\\mu m}$.

The values of $\\alpha_{ox}$ and $U$ are among the largest found in the literature and imply the existence of an X-ray-dominated region (XDR). In fact, this component explains the a priori very surprising non-detection of the [OIII]$_{88\\mu m}$ emission line, which is actually suppressed, instead of boosted, in XDR environments. Interestingly, the best-fitted model implies higher X-ray emission and lower CO content than what is detected observationally, suggesting the presence of a molecular gas component that should be further obscuring the X-ray emission over larger spatial scales than the central region that is being modeled.

Using RAMSES and a magnetized CNM environment as our initial conditions, we simulate a 0.5 kpc turbulent box to model a uniform gas with magnetic field strength of 7 $\\mu G$, varying the 3D velocity dispersion via decaying turbulence. We use a surface density of $320 M_{\\odot} pc^{-2}$, representative of the inner 4.0 kpc CMZ of the Milky Way and typical luminous galaxies. Filamentary molecular clouds are formed dynamically via shocks within a narrow range of velocity dispersions in the CNM of 5 - 10 km/s with a preferred value at 8 km/s. Cluster sink particles appear in filaments which exceed their critical line mass, occurring optimally for velocity dispersions of 8 km/s. Tracking the evolution of magnetic fields, we find that they lead to double the dense star forming gas than in purely hydro runs. Perpendicular orientations between magnetic field and filaments can increase the accretion rates onto filaments and hence their line masses. Because magnetic fields help support gas, MHD runs result in average temperatures an order of magnitude higher than unmagnetized counterparts.

{"title": "Tracing the layers of Photodissociated gas in Trifid Nebula", "abstract": "Photodissociated gas bears the signature of the dynamical evolution of the ambient interstellar medium impacted by the mechanical and radiative feedback from an expanding HII region. Here we present an analysis of the kinematics of the young Trifid nebula, based on velocity-resolved observations of the far-infrared fine-structure lines of [C II] at 158 micron and [O I] at 63 micron. The distribution of the photodissociated regions (PDRs) surrounding the nebula is consistent with a shell-like structure created by the HII region expanding with a velocity of 5 km/s. Comparison of ratios of [C II] and [O I] 63 micron intensities for identical velocity components with PDR models indicate a density of 1e4 /cm^3. The red- and blue-shifted PDR shells with a combined mass of 516 Msun have a kinetic energy of ~1e47 erg. This is consistent with the thermal energy of the HII region as well as with the energy deposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over the 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is lower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to the shell being swept up by an expanding HII region, which suggests that significant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the surrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.", "authors": "Bhaswati Mookerjea, Goeran Sandell", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

In this model, a compact object resides in the vicinity of a merging BBH. Here we report multiple pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that GW190814 is a BBH merging near a compact object. The orbital motion of BBHs around the third body produces a line-of-sight acceleration (LSA) and induces a varying Doppler shift. Using a waveform template that considers LSA, we perform Bayesian inference on a few BBH events with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC). Compared to the model for isolated BBH mergers, we obtain significantly higher network signal-to-noise ratios for GW190814 by that with the LSA and constrain the LSA to $a = 0.0014^{+0.0014}_{-0.0022} ~c~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

These three relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary $L_X$-$L_{UV}$ relations which are constructed respectively by considering a redshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the statistical tool called copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a cosmological-model-independent description of the cosmic background evolution and dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we find that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and high-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary relations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard relation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of the relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations support the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than $3\\sigma$. The Akaike and Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against the standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary relation constructed by considering a redshift dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars.

The main radio structure of SNR G352.7-0.1 forms an outer (large) ellipse. The bright X-ray emitting gas forms a smaller ellipse with a symmetry axis inclined to the symmetry axis of the large radio ellipse. The high abundance of iron and the energy of its X-ray lines suggest a type Ia supernova (SN Ia). The massive swept-up gas suggests a relatively massive progenitor system. I propose a scenario with progenitors of initial masses of M1=5-7Mo and M2=4-5 Mo. At a later phase, the WD remnant of the primary star and the AGB secondary star experience a CEE that ejects the circumstellar material that swept up more ISM to form the large elliptical radio structure. An explosion during the merger of the WD with the core of the AGB star triggered a super-Chandrasekhar thermonuclear explosion that formed the inner structure that is bright in X-ray.

{"title": "Testing a new general diffractive formula with gravitational wave source lensed by its companion in binary systems", "abstract": "For long wavelength gravitational wave (GW), it is easy to diffract when it is lensed by celestial objects. Traditional diffractive integral formula has ignored large angle diffraction, which is adopted in most of cases. However, in some special cases (e. g. a GW source lensed by its companion in a binary system, where the lens is very close to the source), large angle diffraction could be important. Our previous works have proposed a new general diffractive integral formula which has including large angle diffraction case. In this paper, we have investigated how much difference between this general diffractive formula and traditional diffractive integral formula could be under these special cases with different parameters. We find that the module of amplification factor for general diffractive formula could become smaller than that of traditional diffractive integral basically with a factor $r_F\\simeq0.674$ when the distance between lens and sources is $D_{\\rm LS}=1$ AU and lens mass $M_{\\rm L}=1M_\\odot$. Their difference is so significant that it is detectable. Furthermore, we find that the proportionality factor $r_F$ is gradually increasing from 0.5 to 1 with increasing $D_{\\rm LS}$ and it is decreasing with increasing $M_{\\rm L}$. As long as $D_{\\rm LS}\\lesssim3$ AU (with $M_{\\rm L}=1M_\\odot$) or $M_{\\rm L}\\gtrsim0.1M_\\odot$ (with $D_{\\rm LS}=1$ AU ), the difference between new and traditional formulas is enough significant to be detectable.

{"title": "Solar Energetic Particle Charge States and Abundances with Nonthermal Electrons", "abstract": "An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various kappa values in a kappa function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme kappa distribution are about 10-30. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various kappa values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.", "authors": "Jin-Yi Lee, Stephen Kahler, John C.

The massive cluster formation of NGC 1313 may be driven by its greater variation in environments, allowing more clouds with the necessary conditions to arise, although no one parameter seems primarily responsible for the difference in star formation. Meanwhile NGC 7793 has clouds that are as massive and have as much kinetic energy as clouds in the arms of NGC 1313, but have densities and pressures more similar to the interarm regions and so are less inclined to collapse and form stars. The cloud properties in NGC 1313 and NGC 7793 suggest that spiral arms, bars, interarm regions, and flocculent spirals each represent distinct environments with regard to molecular cloud populations. We see surprisingly little difference in surface densities between the regions, suggesting that the differences in surface densities frequently seen between arm and interarm regions of lower-resolution studies are indicative of the sparsity of molecular clouds, rather than differences in their true surface density.", "authors": "Molly K.

{"title": "Is the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b variable?", "abstract": "We present a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope observations of the atmosphere of WASP-121 b, a ultra-hot Jupiter. After reducing the transit, eclipse, and phase-curve observations with a uniform methodology and addressing the biases from instrument systematics, sophisticated atmospheric retrievals are used to extract robust constraints on the thermal structure, chemistry, and cloud properties of the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that the observations are consistent with a strong thermal inversion beginning at ~0.1 bar on the dayside, solar to subsolar metallicity Z (i.e., -0.77 < log(Z) < 0.05), and super-solar C/O ratio (i.e., 0.59 < C/O < 0.87). More importantly, utilizing the high signal-to-noise ratio and repeated observations of the planet, we identify the following unambiguous time-varying signals in the data: i) a shift of the putative hotspot offset between the two phase-curves and ii) varying spectral signatures in the transits and eclipses. By simulating the global dynamics of WASP-121 b atmosphere at high-resolution, we show that the identified signals are consistent with quasi-periodic weather patterns, hence atmospheric variability, with signatures at the level probed by the observations (~5% to ~10%) that change on a timescale of ~5 planet days; in the simulations, the weather patterns arise from the formation and movement of storms and fronts, causing hot (as well as cold) patches of atmosphere to deform, separate, and mix in time.", "authors": "Quentin Changeat, Jack W.

{"title": "RMS-flux slope in MAXI J1820+070: a measure of the disk-corona coupling", "abstract": "Linear RMS-flux relation has been well established in different spectral states of all accreting systems. In this work, we study the evolution of the frequency-dependent RMS-flux relation of MAXI J1820+070 during the initial decaying phase of the 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT over a broad energy range 1-150 keV. As the flux decreases, we first observe a linear RMS-flux relation at frequencies from 2 mHz to 10 Hz, while such a relation breaks at varying times for different energies, leading to a substantial reduction in the slope. Moreover, we find that the low-frequency variability exhibits the highest sensitivity to the break, which occurs prior to the hard-to-hard state transition time determined through time-averaged spectroscopy, and the time deviation increases with energy. The overall evolution of the RMS-flux slope and intercept suggests the presence of a two-component Comptonization system. One component is radially extended, explaining the strong disk-corona coupling before the break, while the other component extends vertically, contributing to the reduction of the disk-corona coupling after the break. A further vertical expansion of the latter component is required to accommodate the dynamic evolution observed in the RMS-flux slope. In conclusion, we suggest that the RMS-flux slope in 1-150 keV band can be employed as an indicator of the disk-corona coupling and the hard-to-hard state transition in MAXI J1820+070 could be partially driven by the changes in the corona geometry.", "authors": "Yanan Wang, Shuang-Nan Zhang", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},

Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in influencing the orbital evolution of binary systems with a low-mass ($\\lt 1-2~M_{\\odot}$) donor star. At present, there exist several different MB descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the formation of PSR J1012+5307 as a probe to test the plausible MB model. Employing a detailed stellar evolution model by the MESA code, we find that the Convection And Rotation Boosted MB and the 'Intermediate' MB models can reproduce the WD mass, WD radius, WD surface gravity, neutron-star mass, and orbital period observed in PSR J1012+5307. However, our simulated WD has higher effective temperature than the observation. Other three MB mechanisms including the standard MB model are too weak to account for the observed orbital period in a Hubble time. A long cooling timescale caused by H-shell flashes of the WD may alleviate the discrepancy between the simulated effective temperature and the observed value.", "authors": "Na Wei, Kun Xu, Zhi-Fu Gao, Long Jiang, Wen-Cong Chen", "date": " 3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "ALMA-LEGUS I: The Influence of Galaxy Morphology on Molecular Cloud Properties", "abstract": "We present a comparative study of the molecular gas in two galaxies from the LEGUS sample: barred spiral NGC 1313 and flocculent spiral NGC 7793. These two galaxies have similar masses, metallicities, and star formation rates, but NGC 1313 is forming significantly more massive star clusters than NGC 7793, especially young massive clusters (<10 Myr, >10^4 Msol). Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations of the two galaxies with the same sensitivities and resolutions of 13 pc, we directly compare the molecular gas in these two similar galaxies to determine the physical conditions responsible for their large disparity in cluster formation. By fitting size-linewidth relations for the clouds in each galaxy, we find that NGC 1313 has a higher intercept than NGC 7793, implying that its clouds have higher kinetic energies at a given size scale. NGC 1313 also has more clouds near virial equilibrium than NGC 7793, which may be connected to its higher rate of massive cluster formation. However, these virially bound clouds do not show a stronger correlation with young clusters than that of the general cloud population. We find surprisingly small differences between the distributions of molecular cloud populations in the two galaxies, though the largest of those differences are that NGC 1313 has higher surface densities and lower free-fall times.", "authors": "Molly K.

This system, containing a F2V star and white-dwarf companion, was amongst the first self-lensing binary systems discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope over the past decade. Each observed pulse occurs when the white dwarf transits in front of its companion star, gravitationally lensing the star's surface, thus making it appear brighter to a distant observer. These two pulses are the very first self-lensing events discovered in TESS observations. We describe the methods by which the data were acquired and detrended, as well as the best-fit binary parameters deduced from our self-lensing+radial velocity model.

We perform a selection of galaxies down to I_E=26 and 28 mag, respectively, for a Euclid Wide Survey spanning 165 deg^2 and a 1 deg^2 Euclid Deep Survey. We build realistic stellar density catalogues containing Milky Way-like stars down to H<26. Using the latest instrumental models for both the Euclid instruments and spacecraft as well as Euclid-like observing sequences, we emulate with high fidelity Euclid satellite imaging throughout the mission's lifetime. We present the SC8 data set consisting of overlapping visible and near-infrared Euclid Wide Survey and Euclid Deep Survey imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy along with ground-based.

In this work, we study 20 biogenic amino acids at the range of Venus' cloud sulfuric acid concentrations (81% and 98% w/w, the rest water) and temperatures. We find 19 of the biogenic amino acids we tested are either unreactive (13 in 98% w/w and 12 in 81% w/w) or chemically modified in the side chain only, after four weeks. Our major finding, therefore, is that the amino acid backbone remains intact in concentrated sulfuric acid.

Different mechanisms and progenitors have been proposed to explain their properties; nevertheless, after analyzing their timing, spectral parameters, host-galaxy properties, luminosity function, and volumetric rates, their nature remains uncertain. We interpret a sub-sample of nine FXTs that show a plateau or a fast-rise light curve within the framework of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger magnetar model. We fit their light curves and derive magnetar (magnetic field and initial rotational period) and ejecta (ejecta mass and opacity) parameters. This model predicts two zones: an orientation-dependent free zone (where the magnetar spin-down X-ray photons escape freely to the observer) and a trapped zone (where the X-ray photons are initially obscured and only escape freely once the ejecta material becomes optically thin). We argue that six FXTs show properties consistent with the free zone and three FXTs with the trapped zone. This sub-sample of FXTs has a similar distribution of magnetic fields and initial rotation periods to those inferred for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), suggesting a possible association. We compare the predicted ejecta emission fed by the magnetar emission (called merger-nova) to the optical and near-infrared upper limits of two FXTs, XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 where contemporaneous optical observations are available. The non-detections place lower limits on the redshifts of XRT 141001 and XRT 210423 of z>1.5 and >0.1, respectively.

The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments, and hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear variability amongst significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were selected based on the following IR light curve properties: (1) $L_\\mathrm{W2}\\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak, (2) fast rise, followed by a slow, monotonic decline, (3) no significant prior variability, and (4) no evidence for AGN activity in WISE colors.

Using narrow line ionization levels and variability arguments, we identified 6 sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total of 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit on the IR-selected TDE rate of $2.0\\pm0.3\\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$ ($1.3\\pm0.2\\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ year$^{-1}$), which is comparable to optical and X-ray TDE rates.

We observed that the equivalent width of the 3-1 transition of the CO band head decreased by half from our first observation to the second, or slightly over one day out of the 17.867-day period. Our third observation occurred 54 days after the first (slightly over three periods for the star) and showed similar CO levels to the first observation, suggesting that the CO is in the stellar atmosphere and varies with pulsation.", "authors": "Scott G.

J1507+3013 possesses a morphology similar to the recently identified circular, low-surface-brightness, edge-brightened radio sources commonly known as odd radio circles (ORCs). Such diffuse emissions, as reported in this paper, are also found in mini-haloes and fossil radio galaxies, but the results presented here do not match the properties of mini-haloes or of fossil radio galaxies. The extended emission observed in J1507+3013 around an elliptical galaxy is a very rare class of diffuse emission that is unlike any previously known class of diffuse emission. The extended diffuse emission of J1507+3013 is also detected in the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) at 144 MHz. J1507+3013 is hosted by an optical galaxy near the geometrical centre of the structure with a photometric redshift of $z=0.079$. The physical extent of J1507+3013 is approximately 68 kpc, with a peak-to-peak angular size of 44 arcsec. It shows a significantly higher flux density compared with previously discovered ORCs. The spectral index of J1507+3013 varies between -0.90 and -1.4 in different regions of the diffuse structure, which is comparable to the case for previously discovered ORCs but less steep than for mini-haloes and fossil radio galaxies. If we consider J1507+3013 as a candidate ORC, then this would be the closest and most luminous ORC discovered so far. This paper describes the radio, spectral, and optical/IR properties of J1507+3013 in order to study the nature of this source.", "authors": "Shobha Kumari, Sabyasachi Pal", "date": " 21 Dec 2023 ("},

{"title": "Decayless oscillations in 3D coronal loops excited by a power-law driver", "abstract": "Aims. We studied the manifestation of decayless oscillations in 3D simulations of coronal loops, driven by random motions. Methods. Using the PLUTO code, we ran magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a straight gravitationally stratified flux tube, with its footpoints embedded in chromospheric plasma. We consider transverse waves drivers with a horizontally polarised red noise power-law spectrum. Results. Our broadband drivers lead to the excitation of standing waves with frequencies equal to the fundamental standing kink mode and its harmonics. These standing kink oscillations have non-decaying amplitudes, and spectra that depend on the characteristics of the loops, with the latter amplifying the resonant frequencies from the drivers. We thus report for the first time in 3D simulations the manifestation of decayless oscillations from broadband drivers. The spatial and temporal evolution of our oscillation spectra reveals the manifestation of a half harmonic, which exhibits half the frequency of the identified fundamental mode with a similar spatial profile. Our results suggest that this mode is related to the presence of the transition region in our model and could be interpreted as being the equivalent to the fundamental mode of standing sound waves driven on pipes closed at one end. Conclusions. The potential existence of this half harmonic has important implications for coronal seismology, since misinterpreting it for the fundamental mode of the system can lead to false estimations of the average kink speed profile along oscillating loops. Finally, its detection could potentially give us a tool for distinguishing between different excitation and driving mechanisms of decayless oscillations in observations.", "authors": "Konstantinos Karampelas, Tom Van Doorsselaere", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

Introducing phase-correlated variability analysis (PCVA) with a case study of Cen X-3", "abstract": "Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars offer a unique opportunity to study physics under extreme conditions. To fully exploit this potential, the interrelated problems of modelling radiative transport and the dynamical structure of the accretion flow must, however, be solved. This task is challenging both from a theoretical and observational point of view and is further complicated by a lack of direct correspondence between the properties of emission emerging from the neutron star and observed far away from it. In general, a mixture of emission from both poles of the neutron star viewed from different angles is indeed observed at some or even all phases of the pulse cycle. It is essential, therefore, to reconstruct the contributions of each pole to the observed flux in order to test and refine models describing the formation of the spectra and pulse profiles of X-ray pulsars. In this paper we propose a novel data-driven approach to address this problem using the pulse-to-pulse variability in the observed flux, and demonstrate its application to RXTE observations of the bright persistent X-ray pulsar Cen X-3. We then discuss the comparison of our results with previous work attempting to solve the same problem and how they can be qualitatively interpreted in the framework of a toy model describing emission from the poles of a neutron star.", "authors": "Inga Saathoff, Victor Doroshenko, Andrea Santangelo", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Optically-thick Structure in Early B Type Supergiant Stellar Winds at Low Metallicities", "abstract": "Accurate determination of mass-loss rates from massive stars is important to understanding stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Large-scale structure and variability in stellar winds have significant effects on mass-loss rates. Time-series observations provide direct quantification of such variability. Observations of this nature are available for some Galactic early supergiant stars but not yet for stars in lower metallicity environments such as the Magellanic Clouds. We utilise ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope ULLYSES program to demonstrate that the presence of structure in stellar winds of supergiant stars at low metallicities may be discerned from single-epoch spectra. We find evidence that, for given stellar luminosities and mean stellar wind optical depths, structure is more prevalent at higher metallicities. We confirm, at Large Magellanic Cloud (0.5 Z_solar), Small Magellanic Cloud (0.2 Z_solar) and lower (0.14 -- 0.1 Z_solar) metallicities, earlier Galactic results that there does not appear to be correlation between the degree of structure in stellar winds of massive stars and stellar effective temperature. Similar lack of correlation is found with regard to terminal velocity of stellar winds. Additional and revised values for radial velocities of stars and terminal velocities of stellar winds are presented. Direct evidence of temporal variability, on timescales of several days, in stellar wind at low metallicity is found. We illustrate that narrow absorption components in wind-formed profiles of Galactic OB stellar spectra remain common in early B supergiant spectra at low metallicities, providing means for better constraining hot, massive star mass-loss rates.", "authors": "Timothy N.

{"title": "Temperature-reducing shocks in optically-thin radiative MHD -- analytical and numerical results", "abstract": "Shocks are often invoked as heating mechanisms in astrophysical systems, with both adiabatic compression and dissipative heating that leading to temperature increases. Whilst shocks are reasonably well understood for ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems, in many astrophysical plasmas, radiation is an important phenomena, which can allow energy to leave the system. As such, energy becomes non-conservative which can fundamentally change the behaviour of shocks. The energy emitted through optically-thin radiation post-shock can exceed the thermal energy increase, resulting in shocks that reduce the temperature of the medium, i.e., cooling shocks that have a net decrease in temperature across the interface. In this paper, semi-analytical solutions for radiative shocks are derived to demonstrate that both cooling (temperature decreasing) and heating (temperature increasing) shock solutions are possible in radiative MHD. Numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection with optically-thin radiative losses also yield both heating and cooling shocks in roughly equal abundances. The detected cooling shocks feature a significantly lower pressure jump across the shock than their heating counterparts. The compression at the shock front leads to locally-enhanced radiative losses, resulting in significant cooling within a few grid cells in the upstream and downstream directions. The presence of temperature-reducing (cooling) shocks is critical in determining the thermal evolution, and heating or cooling, across a wealth of radiative astrophysical plasmas.", "authors": "Ben Snow", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "On the evolution of a twisted thin accretion disc in eccentric inclined supermassive binary black holes", "abstract": "We propose a model of a twisted accretion disc around a Kerr black hole interacting with a secondary black hole of a smaller mass on an inclined eccentric orbit. We use parameters of the system, which may be appropriate for the so-called 'precessing massive' model of OJ 287. We calculate expressions for torque exerted on the disc by the secondary and a contribution of the secondary to the apsidal precession of disc elements by a double averaging procedure over the periods of the secondary and the disc elements. These expressions are used at all scales of interest, including the ones inside the binary orbit. We calculate numerically the evolution of the disc tilt and twist assuming a flat initial configuration. We consider the disc aspect ratio $h/r=10^{-3}$, a rather large viscosity parameter $\\alpha=0.1$ and several values of the primary rotational parameter, $\\chi$. We find that, after a few periods of Lense-Thirring precession of the orbit, the disc relaxes to a quasi-stationary configuration in the precessing frame with a non-trivial distribution of the disc inclination angle, $\\beta$, over the radial scale. We propose an analytic model for this configuration. We show that the presence of the twisted disc leads to multiple crossings of the disc by the secondary per one orbital period, with time periods between the crossings being different from the flat disc model. Our results should be taken into account in the modelling of OJ 287. They can also be applied to similar sources.", "authors": "P. B. Ivanov, V. V. Zhuravlev", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},

Future transient surveys are expected to detect several tens of thousands of TDEs, among which a small fraction may be strongly gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. In this paper, we statistically etsimate the detection rate of lensed TDEs, with dependence on the limiting magnitude of the transient all-sky surveys searching for them. We find that the requisite limiting magnitude for an all-sky transient survey to observe at least $1$ yr$^{-1}$ is $\\gtrsim 21.3$, $21.2$, and $21.5$ mag in the u-, g-, and z-bands, respectively. If the limiting magnitude of the all-sky survey can reach $\\sim 25-26$ mag in the u-, g-, and z-bands, the detection rate can be upto about several tens to hundreds per year. The discovery and identification of the first image of the lensed TDE can be taken as an early-warning of the second and other subsequent images, which may enable detailed monitoring of the pre-peak photometry and spectroscopy evolution of the TDE. The additional early-stage information may help to constrain the dynamical and radiation processes involving in the TDEs.", "authors": "Zhiwei Chen, Youjun Lu, Yunfeng Chen", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "The depletion of star-forming gas by AGN activity in radio sources", "abstract": "Cold, neutral interstellar gas, the reservoir for star formation, is traced through the absorption of the 21-centimetre continuum radiation by neutral hydrogen (HI). Although detected in one hundred cases in the host galaxies of distant radio sources, only recently have column densities approaching the maximum value observed in Lyman-alpha absorption systems been found. Here we explore the implications these have for the hypothesis that the detection rate of HI absorption is dominated by photo-ionisation from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find, with the addition all of the current searches for HI absorption at z > 0.1, a strong correlation between the HI absorption strength and the ionising photon rate, with the maximum value at which HI is detected remaining close to the theoretical value in which all of the neutral gas would be ionised in a large spiral galaxy (Q = 2.9e56 ionising photons/s). We also rule out other effects (excitation by the radio continuum and changing gas properties) as the dominant cause for the decrease in the detection rate with redshift. Furthermore, from the maximum theoretical column density we find that the five high column density systems have spin temperatures close to those of the Milky Way (T < 300 K), whereas, from our model of a gaseous galactic disk, the HI detection at Q= 2.9e56 per s yields T~10 000 K, consistent with the gas being highly ionised.", "authors": "S J Curran", "date": " 1 Jan 2024"},

We examine high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra of six stars in the Cygnus Loop region with distances greater than ~700 pc. All stars show low-velocity Na I and Ca II absorption. However, only one star, HD 198301, exhibits high-velocity Ca II absorption components, at velocities of +62, +82, and +96 km/s. The distance to this star of ~870 pc helps to constrain the distance to the receding edge of the Cygnus Loop's expanding shock front. One of our targets, HD 335334, was previously thought to exhibit high positive and high negative velocity interstellar Na I and Ca II absorption. This was one factor leading Fesen et al. to derive a distance to the Cygnus Loop of 725 pc. However, we find that HD 335334 is in fact a double-line spectroscopic binary and shows no evidence of high-velocity interstellar absorption. As such, the distance to HD 335334 cannot be used to constrain the distance to the Cygnus Loop. Our detection of Ca II absorption approaching 100 km/s toward HD 198301 is the first conclusive detection of high-velocity absorption from a low ionization species associated with the Cygnus Loop SNR.

This behaviour is the same as that of the Ne line-emission plasma presented in our previous paper.

By comparing the observed and calculated line-of-sight velocities, we update the distance of the Ne line-emission site from the stagnation point.

The almost absence of extremely metal poor (Z=0.0001) stars seems to be due to pre-enrichment during the re-ionization era. Star formation gradually decreases during this initial period.

Most moderately old stellar populations with intermediate metallicity were formed during this phase. We observe a strong dependence of SFHs on the mass and u-r color of dS0 galaxies but no significant dependence on morphological properties such as the presence or absence of outer spiral arms and nucleation.

On average, QGs are 45% (15%) more compact at rest-frame 1$\\mu m$ than they are at 0.3$\\mu m$ (0.5$\\mu m$). Regardless of wavelengths, the $R_e$ of QGs strongly evolves with redshift, and this evolution depends on stellar mass. For lower-mass QGs with $M_*=10^{10}-10^{10.6}M_\\odot$, the evolution follows $R_e\\sim(1+z)^{-1.1}$, whereas it becomes steeper, following $R_e\\sim(1+z)^{-1.7}$, for higher-mass QGs with $M_*>10^{10.6}M_\\odot$. To constrain the physical mechanisms driving the apparent size evolution, we study the relationship between $R_e$ and the formation redshift ($z_{form}$) of QGs. For lower-mass QGs, this relationship is broadly consistent with $R_e\\sim(1+z_{form})^{-1}$, in line with the expectation of the progenitor effect. For higher-mass QGs, the relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ depends on stellar age. Older QGs have a steeper relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ than that expected from the progenitor effect alone, suggesting that mergers and/or post-quenching continuous gas accretion drive additional size growth in very massive systems.

We also consider mechanisms where the DM abundance is fixed through the interaction with the SM, which directly motivates the search for light DM in terrestrial experiments. The bulk of this review is dedicated to the new ideas that have been proposed for directly detecting such DM candidates of a low mass, through nuclear recoils, electronic excitations, or collective modes such as phonons and magnons.

Given previous claims for high-precision constraints, we critically examine the veracity of a so-called ``blinding'' approach, in which alpha is fixed at the terrestrial value during the model building process, releasing it as a free parameter only after the ``final'' absorption system kinematic structure has been obtained. We show that this approach results in an extended flat canyon in chi squared-alpha space, such that convergence is unlikely to be reached, even after as many as 1000 iterations. The fix is straightforward: alpha must be treated as a free parameter from the earliest possible stages of absorption system model building. The implication of the results presented here is that all previous measurements that have used initially-fixed alpha should be reworked.", "authors": "John K.

First, we calculate the modified Friedmann equations and the modified slow-roll parameters. Subsequently, we apply the slow-roll approximations to derive the scalar power spectrum and the tensor power spectrum. Also, we develop formulations of the scalar and tensor perturbations for the f (Q, T ) gravity with warm inflation scenario. Furthermore, we scrutinize two different forms of the dissipation coefficient, a constant and a function of the inflaton field to determine the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the temperature for the power-law potential case. By imposing some constraints on the free parameters of the model, we attain results in good agreement with both the Planck 2018 data and the joint Planck, BK15 and BAO data for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and consistent results aligned with the Planck 2018 data for the scalar spectral index. Consequently, we are able to revive the power-law potential that was previously ruled out by observational data. Moreover, for the variable dissipation coefficient, the model leads to the scalar spectral index with the blue and red tilts in agreement with the WMAP three years data.", "authors": "Maryam Shiravand, Mehrdad Farhoudi", "date": " 7 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "NanoNewton electrostatic force actuators for femtoNewton-sensitive measurements: system performance test in the LISA Pathfinder mission", "abstract": "Electrostatic force actuation is a key component of the system of geodesic reference test masses (TM) for the LISA orbiting gravitational wave observatory and in particular for performance at low frequencies, below 1 mHz, where the observatory sensitivity is limited by stray force noise. The system needs to apply forces of order 10$^{-9}$ N while limiting fluctuations in the measurement band to levels approaching 10$^{-15}$ N/Hz$^{1/2}$. We present here the LISA actuation system design, based on audio-frequency voltage carrier signals, and results of its in-flight performance test with the LISA Pathfinder test mission. In LISA, TM force actuation is used to align the otherwise free-falling TM to the spacecraft-mounted optical metrology system, without any forcing along the critical gravitational wave-sensitive interferometry axes. In LISA Pathfinder, on the other hand, the actuation was used also to stabilize the TM along the critical $x$ axis joining the two TM, with the commanded actuation force entering directly into the mission's main differential acceleration science observable. The mission allowed demonstration of the full compatibility of the electrostatic actuation system with the LISA observatory requirements, including dedicated measurement campaigns to amplify, isolate, and quantify the two main force noise contributions from the actuation system, from actuator gain noise and from low frequency ``in band'' voltage fluctuations. These campaigns have shown actuation force noise to be a relevant, but not dominant, noise source in LISA Pathfinder and have allowed performance projections for the conditions expected in the LISA mission.", "authors": "M Armano, H Audley, J Baird, M Bassan, P Binetruy, M Born, D Bortoluzzi, E Castelli, A Cavalleri, A Cesarini, V Chiavegato, A M Cruise, D Dal Bosco, K Danzmann, M De Deus Silva, R De Rosa, L Di Fiore, I Diepholz, G Dixon, R Dolesi, L Ferraioli V Ferroni, E D Fitzsimons, M Freschi, L Gesa, D Giardini, F Gibert, R Giusteri, A Grado, C Grimani, J Grzymisch, I Harrison, M S Hartig, G Heinzel, M Hewitson, D Hollington, D Hoyland, M Hueller, H Inchauspé, O Jennrich, P Jetzer, B Johlander, N Karnesis, B Kaune, N Korsakova, C J Killow, L Liu, J A Lobo, J P López-Zaragoza, R Maarschalkerweerd, D Mance, V Martín, L Martin-Polo, F Martin-Porqueras, J Martino, P W McNamara, J Mendes, L Mendes, N Meshksar, J Moerschell, M Nofrarias, S Paczkowski, M Perreur-Lloyd, A Petiteau, E Plagnol, C Praplan, J Ramos-Castro, J Reiche, F Rivas, D I Robertson, G Russano, L Sala, P Sarra, S L Schule-Walewski, J Slutsky, C F Sopuerta, R Stanga, T Sumner, J ten Pierick, D Texier, J I Thorpe, D Vetrugno, S Vitale, G Wanner, H Ward, P Wass, W J Weber, L Wissel, A Wittchen, C Zanoni, P Zweifel", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

{"title": "Detection and Mitigation of Glitches in LISA Data: A Machine Learning Approach", "abstract": "The proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is tasked with the detection and characterization of gravitational waves from various sources in the universe. This endeavor is challenged by transient displacement and acceleration noise artifacts, commonly called glitches. Uncalibrated glitches impact the interferometric measurements and decrease the signal quality of LISA's time-delay interferometry (TDI) data used for astrophysical data analysis. The paper introduces a novel calibration pipeline that employs a neural network ensemble to detect, characterize, and mitigate transient glitches of diverse morphologies. A convolutional neural network is designed for anomaly detection, accurately identifying and temporally pinpointing anomalies within the TDI time series. Then, a hybrid neural network is developed to differentiate between gravitational wave bursts and glitches, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) network architecture is deployed for glitch estimation. The LSTM network acts as a TDI inverter by processing noisy TDI data to obtain the underlying glitch dynamics. Finally, the inferred noise transient is subtracted from the interferometric measurements, enhancing data integrity and reducing biases in the parameter estimation of astronomical targets. We propose a low-latency solution featuring generalized LSTM networks primed for rapid response data processing and alert service in high-demand scenarios like predicting binary black hole mergers.

However, the eye-brain system functions differently from electronic sensors and its products can be expected to have different characteristics. Here I characterize some aspects of the visual data set by examining ten well-observed variable stars from the AAVSO database. The standard deviation around a best-fit curve ranges from 0.14 to 0.34 magnitude, smaller than most previous estimates. The difference in scatter between stars is significant, but does not correlate with such things as range or quickness of variation, or even with color. Naked-eye variables, which would be expected to be more difficult to observe accurately, in fact show the smallest scatter. The difference between observers (bias) is less important than each observer's internal precision. A given observer's precision is not set but varies from star to star for unknown reasons.

Evolutionary stellar models in the gap between subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars", "abstract": "Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of He-core remnants of the primary components of intermediate-mass close binaries that lost most of their H/He envelopes due to the mass exchange. They are expected to be observed as (1-7) solar mass hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdO/B and WR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy, but none of them have been identified so far. We aim to provide comprehensive predictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their companions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations, to enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations, and to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy. We expanded the previously considered space of parameters describing progenitors of He-stars and applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the code MESA. The estimated number of Galactic binaries hosting (1-7) solar mass He-stars is about 20000; it declines to about 3000 for mass exceeding two solar ones. The decisive factor that defines the number of He-stars is runaway mass loss after Roche lobe overflow by primary components, resulting in formation of common envelopes and merger of components. He-stars are much less numerous than expected, since a fraction of close binaries with primary masses below (5-7) solar ones produce subdwarfs with masses below solar. Overwhelming majority of He-stars reside in binaries with an early-type companions and can be identified neither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a significant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (exceeding several hundred days) also hamper their discovery. (Abridged).", "authors": "L. Yungelson, A. Kuranov, K.

Using the higher resolution and sensitivity of OGHReS has allowed us to correct the velocity for 632 clumps and provide velocities for 687 clumps for which no velocity had been previously allocated. The velocities are used with a rotation curve to refine the distances to the clumps and to calculate the clumps' properties using a distance-dependent gas-to-dust ratio. We have determined reliable physical parameters for 3200 outer Galaxy dense clumps (~90% of the HiGAL sources in the region). We find a trend of decreasing luminosity-to-mass ratio with increasing Galactocentric distance, suggesting the star formation efficiency is lower in the outer Galaxy or that it is resulting in more lower mass stars than in the inner Galaxy.

The results obtained so far suggested a tension between observations and predictions of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. However, the dataset of $H(z)$ direct measurements from cosmic chronometers and BAO was quite limited. This motivated us to study the performance of this test on a larger sample obtained in an alternative way. In this Letter, we propose that gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens could provide large samples of $H(z)$ measurements in the redshift range of $0<z<5$, based on the measurements of dipole anisotropy of luminosity distance arising from the matter inhomogeneities of large-scale structure and the local motion of observer. We discuss the effectiveness of our method in the context of the future generation space-borne DECi-herz Interferometer Gravitaional-wave Observatory (DECIGO), based on a comprehensive $H(z)$ simulated data set from binary neutron star merger systems. Our result indicate that in the GW domain, the $Omh^2(z_i,z_j)$ two point diagnostics could effectively distinguish whether $\\Lambda$CDM is the best description of our Universe.

Thus, it is necessary to measure cosmic curvature and opacity simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent method to simultaneously measure the cosmic curvature and opacity by using the latest observations of HII galaxies acting as standard candles and the latest Hubble parameter observations. The machine learning method-Artificial Neural Network is adopted to reconstruct observed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ observations.

{"title": "Modelling magnetically formed neutron star mountains", "abstract": "With the onset of the era of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, the search for continuous gravitational waves (CGWs), which remain undetected to date, has intensified in more ways than one. Rapidly rotating neutron stars with non-axisymmetrical deformations are the main targets for CGW searches. The extent of this quadrupolar deformation is measured by the maximum ellipticity that can be sustained by the crust of a neutron star and it places an upper limit on the CGW amplitudes emitted by such systems. In this paper, following previous works on this subject, we calculate the maximum ellipticity of a neutron star generated by the Lorentz force exerted on it by the internal magnetic fields. We show that the ellipticity of stars deformed by such a Lorentz force is of the same order of magnitude as previous theoretical and astrophysical constraints. We also consider if this ellipticity can be further enhanced by crustal surface currents. We discover that this is indeed true; surface currents at crustal boundaries are instrumental towards enhancing the ellipticity of magnetized neutron stars.", "authors": "Amlan Nanda", "date": " 1 Jan 2024"},

To quantify the impact and determine the launching mechanisms of these outflows, we need to measure the wind plasma number density, an important ingredient in the theoretical disk wind models. While X-ray spectroscopy is a crucial tool to understanding the wind properties, such as their velocity and ionization, in nearly all cases, we lack the signal-to-noise to constrain the plasma number density, weakening the constraints on outflow location and mass outflow rate. We present a new approach to determine this number density in the X-ray binary Hercules X-1 by measuring the speed of the wind ionization response to time-variable illuminating continuum. Hercules X-1 is powered by a highly magnetized neutron star, pulsating with a period of 1.24 s. We show that the wind number density in Hercules X-1 is sufficiently high to respond to these pulsations by modeling the ionization response with the time-dependent photoionization model TPHO. We then perform a pulse-resolved analysis of the best-quality XMM-Newton observation of Hercules X-1 and directly detect the wind response, confirming that the wind density is at least $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we simulate XRISM observations of Hercules X-1 and show that they will allow us to accurately measure the number density at different locations within the outflow.

{"title": "Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and its falling evaporating bodies", "abstract": "For decades, the spectral variations of Beta Pictoris have been modelled as the result of the evaporation of exocomets close to the star, termed falling evaporating bodies (FEBs). Resonant perturbations by a giant planet have been proposed to explain the dynamical origin of these stargrazers. The disk is now known to harbour two giant planets, Beta Pic b and c, orbiting the star at 9.9 au and 2.7 au. While the former almost matches the planet formerly suspected, the discovery of the latter complicates the picture. We first question the stability of the two-planet system. Then we investigate the dynamics of a disk of planetesimals orbiting the star with both planets to check the validity of the FEB generation mechanism. Symplectic N-body simulations are used to determine which regions of the planetesimal disk are dynamically stable. Then we focus on regions where disk particles are able to reach high eccentricities thanks to resonant mechanisms. The first result is that the system is dynamically stable. Both planets may temporarily fall in 7:1 mean motion resonance (MMR). Then, simulations reveal that the whole region extending between ~1.5 au and ~25 au is unstable to planetary perturbations. However, a disk below 1.5 au survives, which appears to constitute an active source of FEBs via high-order MMRs with Beta Pic c. Beta Pic b acts as a distant perturber that helps sustain the whole process. These simulations rule out the preceding FEB generation mechanism model, which placed their origin at around 4-5 au. Conversely, FEBs are likely to originate from a region much further in and related to MMRs with Beta Pic c. That mechanism also appears to last longer, as new planetesimals are able to continuously enter the MMRs and evolve towards the FEB state. Subsequently, the physical nature of the FEBs may differ from that previously thought, and presumably may not be icy.", "authors": "H. Beust, J. Milli, A. Morbidelli, S. Lacour, A.-M. Lagrange, G.

{"title": "Hubble Asteroid Hunter III. Physical properties of newly found asteroids", "abstract": "Determining the size distribution of asteroids is key for understanding the collisional history and evolution of the inner Solar System. We aim at improving our knowledge on the size distribution of small asteroids in the Main Belt by determining the parallaxes of newly detected asteroids in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Archive and hence their absolute magnitudes and sizes. Asteroids appear as curved trails in HST images due to the parallax induced by the fast orbital motion of the spacecraft. The parallax effect can be computed to obtain the distance to the asteroids by fitting simulated trajectories to the observed trails. Using distance, we can obtain the object's absolute magnitude and size estimation assuming an albedo value, along with some boundaries for its orbital parameters. In this work we analyse a set of 632 serendipitously imaged asteroids found in the ESA HST Archive. An object-detection machine learning algorithm was used to perform this task during previous work. Our raw data consists of 1,031 asteroids trails from unknown objects (not matching any entries in the MPC database). We also found 670 trails from known objects (objects featuring matching entries in the MPC). After an accuracy assessment and filtering process, our analysed HST set consists of 454 unknown objects and 178 known objects. We obtain a sample dominated by potential Main Belt objects featuring absolute magnitudes (H) mostly between 15 and 22 mag. The absolute magnitude cumulative distribution confirms the previously reported slope change for 15 < H < 18, from 0.56 to 0.26, maintained in our case down to absolute magnitudes around H = 20, hence expanding the previous results by approximately two magnitudes.

In this work, we report for the first time the detection of the high-energy cutoff ($E_{\\rm cut}$), a direct indicator of thermal coronal radiation, of X-ray emission in Mrk 348 ($z$ = 0.015), a young radio galaxy classified as compact symmetric object. With a 100 ks NuSTAR exposure, we find that the high-energy cutoff ($E_{\\rm cut}$ ) is firmly detected ($218^{+124}_{-62}$ keV). Fitting with various Comptonization models indicates the presence of a hot corona with temperature $kT_{\\rm e}$ = 35 -- 40 keV. These strongly support the corona origin for its hard X-ray emission. The comparison in the $E_{\\rm cut}$ -- spectra index $\\Gamma$ plot of Mrk 348 with normal large-scale radio galaxies (mostly FR II) yields no difference between them. This suggests the corona properties in radio sources may not evolve over time (i.e., from the infant stage to mature stage), which is to-be-confirmed with future sample studies of young radio AGN.", "authors": "Mai Liao, Junxian Wang, Jialai Kang, Xiaofeng Li, Minhua Zhou", "date": " 6 Jan 2024 ("},

However, measurements of elemental abundances ratios, and our interpretations of them, strongly depend on the physical assumptions that dictate the generation of synthetic stellar spectra. Three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (3D RHD) ``box-in-a-star'' simulations of stellar atmospheres offer a more realistic representation of surface convection occurring in late-type stars compared to traditional one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic models. As evident from a multitude of observational tests, the coupling of 3D RHD models with line-formation in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) today provides a solid foundation for abundance analysis for many elements.

In particular, we focus on the class of models belonging to the Kinetic Gravity Braiding by adopting a general parametrization of the action encoding a large set of models by means of four free parameters: two defining the background evolution and two affecting the perturbations. For the latter we identify their specific signatures on the linearised critical density contrast, nonlinear effective gravitational coupling and the virial overdensity and how they drive their predictions away from $\\Lambda$CDM. We then use the results of the spherical collapse model to predict the evolution of the halo mass function. We find that the shift-symmetric model predicts a larger number of objects compared to $\\Lambda$CDM for masses $M \\gtrsim 10^{14} h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and such number increases for larger deviations from the standard model. Therefore, the shift-symmetric model shows detectable signatures which can be used to distinguish it from the standard scenario.", "authors": "Inês S.

We also produce the distance and photometric metallicity estimates for the known substructures. While these quantities for the GSS are reproduced in our study, we find that the North-Western stream shows a steeper distance gradient than found in an earlier study, suggesting that it is likely to have formed in an orbit closer to the Milky Way. For two streams in the eastern halo (Stream C and D), we identify distance gradients that had not been resolved. Finally, we investigate the global halo photometric metallicity distribution and surface brightness profile using the NB515-selected halo stars. We find that the surface brightness of the metal-poor and metal-rich halo populations, and the all population can be fitted to a power-law profile with an index of $\\alpha = -1.65 \\pm 0.02$, $-2.82\\pm0.01$, and $-2.44\\pm0.01$, respectively.

This numerical method is particularly suited to the study of static black holes in modified gravity, where the traditional second-order, Schrödinger-like, form of the equations of motion is not always available. Our approach relies on the knowledge of the asymptotic behaviours of the perturbations near the black hole horizon and at spatial infinity, which can be obtained via the systematic algorithm that we have proposed recently. In this work, we first present our method for the perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole and show that we recover the well-know frequencies of the QNMs to a very high precision.

However, the question remains if fine-tuning can indeed be known. Using a mathematization of the epistemological concepts of learning and knowledge acquisition, we argue that most examples that have been touted as fine-tuned cannot be formally assessed as such.

However, little has been studied about the Geminid formation based on the assumption that mass ejection happened from this asteroid via rotational instability. Aims: Here, we present the first dynamical study of the Geminid formation, taking account of low-velocity mass ejection as a result of Phaethon's rotational instability. Methods: We conducted numerical simulations for 1 mm and 1 cm particles ejected in a wide range of ejection epochs (10$^3$--10$^5$ years ago). We computed the minimum orbital intersecting distance (MOID) of the dust particles as the realistic condition, that is, the Earth's radius and the Earth-Moon distance to be observed as the Geminid meteoroid stream. Results: We found that the low-velocity ejection model produced the Geminid-like meteoroid stream when the dust particles were ejected more than $\\sim$2,000 years ago. In this case, close encounters with terrestrial planets would transport some dust particles from the Phaethon orbit (the current MOID is as large as $\\sim$460 Earth radius) to the Earth-intersecting orbits. The optimal ejection epoch and the estimated mass were 18\\,000 years ago and $\\sim 10^{10} - 10^{14}$ g (<0.1 \\% of the Phaethon mass).

We aim to use simultaneous multicolour transit photometry to improve the estimation of transit parameters, to search for transit timing variations (TTVs), and to establish which of our targets should be prioritised for follow-up transmission spectroscopy. We performed time series photometric observations of 12 transits for the hot Jupiters HAT-P-19b, HAT-P-51b, HAT-P-55b, and HAT-P-65b using the simultaneous four-colour camera MuSCAT2 on the Telescopio Carlos Sánchez. We collected 56 additional transit light curves from TESS photometry. To derive transit parameters, we modelled the MuSCAT2 light curves with Gaussian processes to account for correlated noise. To derive physical parameters, we performed EXOFASTv2 global fits to the available transit and radial velocity data sets, together with the Gaia DR3 parallax, isochrones, and spectral energy distributions. To assess the potential for atmospheric characterisation, we compared the multicolour transit depths with a flat line and a clear atmosphere model. We consistently refined the transit and physical parameters. We improved the orbital period and ephemeris estimates, and found no evidence for TTVs or orbital decay. The MuSCAT2 broadband transmission spectra of HAT-P-19b and HAT-P-65b are consistent with previously published low-resolution transmission spectra.

For a given number of BNS mergers detected by their GW signals, the expected numbers of their EM counterparts that can be detected by a survey with given selection criteria depend on the kilonova properties, including the anisotropy. In this paper, we investigate whether the anisotropy of kilonova radiation and the kilonova model can be constrained statistically by the counting method, i.e., using the numbers of BNS mergers detected via GW and multi-band EM signals. Adopting simple models for the BNS mergers, afterglows, and a simple two (blue and red)-component model for kilonovae, we generate mock samples for GW detected BNS mergers, their associated kilonovae and afterglows detected in multi-bands. By assuming some criteria for searching the EM counterparts, we simulate the observations of these EM counterparts and obtain the EM observed samples in different bands. With the numbers of BNS mergers detected by GW detectors and EM survey telescopes in different bands, we show that the anisotropy of kilonova radiation and the kilonova model can be well constrained by using the Bayesian analysis.

The method, implemented in our bajes infrastructure, incorporates a joint likelihood for multiple datasets, support for various semi-analytical kilonova models and numerical-relativity (NR) informed relations for the mass ejecta, as well as a technique to include and marginalize over modeling uncertainties. As a first application, we analyze the gravitational-wave GW170817 and the kilonova AT2017gfo data. These results are then combined with the most recent X-ray pulsars analyses of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 to obtain EOS constraints.Various constraints on the mass-radius diagram and neutron star properties are then obtained by resampling over a set of ten million parametrized EOS built under minimal assumptions. We find that a joint and coherent approach improves the inference of the extrinsic parameters (distance) and, among the instrinc parameters, the mass ratio. The inclusion of NR informed relations strongly improves over the case of using an agnostic prior on the intrinsic parameters. Comparing Bayes factors, we find that the two observations are better explained by the common source hypothesis only by assuming NR-informed relations. These relations break some of the degeneracies in the employed kN models. The EOS inference folding-in PSR J0952-0607 minimum-maximum mass, PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 data constrains, among other quantities, the neutron star radius to $R_{1.4}={12.30}^{+0.81}_{-0.56}$ km ($R_{1.4}={13.20}^{+0.91}_{-0.90}$ km) and the maximum mass to $M_{max}={2.28}^{+0.25}_{-0.17}~{\\rm M_\\odot}$ ($M_{max}={2.32}^{+0.30}_{-0.19}~{\\rm M_\\odot}$) where the ST+PDT (PDT-U) analysis for PSR J0030+0451 is employed.Hence, the systematics on PSR J0030+0451 data reduction currently dominate the mass-radius diagram constraints.", "authors": "Matteo Breschi, Rossella Gamba, Gregorio Carullo, Daniel Godzieba, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Albino Perego, David Radice", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

Introduced to explain the apparent acceleration of the Universe's expansion, its origin remains to be determined. In this paper, we illustrate a result that may significantly impact understanding the relationship between dark energy and structure formation in the late-epoch Universe. Our analysis exploits a scale-dependent energy functional, initially developed for image visualization, to compare the physical and geometrical data that distinct cosmological observers register on their celestial spheres. In the presence of late-epoch gravitational structures, this functional provides a non-perturbative technique that allows the standard Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) observer to evaluate a measurable, scale-dependent difference between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the physical light cone. From the point of view of the FLRW observer, this difference manifests itself as a redshift-dependent correction $\\Lambda^{(corr)}(z)$ to the FLRW cosmological constant $\\Lambda^{(FLRW)}$. At the scale where cosmological expansion couples with the local virialized dynamics of gravitational structures, we get $\\Lambda^{(corr)}(z)\\sim 10^{-52}\\,m^{-2}$, indicating that the late-epoch structures induce an effective cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as the assumed value of the FLRW cosmological constant, a result that may lead to an interpretative shift in the very role of dark energy.", "authors": "Mauro Carfora, Francesca Familiari", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

We take into account realistic diffusion coefficients of the Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion based on detailed chemical reactions with a single-size dust grains. We found that the conventional dead zone identified by the Elsässer numbers of the Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion is divided into two regions: \"the transition zone\" and \"the coherent zone\". The coherent zone has the same properties as the conventional dead zone, and extends outside of the transition zone in the radial direction. Between the active and coherent zones, we discover the transition zone whose inner edge is identical to that of the conventional dead-zone. The transition zone extends out over the regions where thermal ionization determines diffusion coefficients. The transition zone has completely different physical properties than the conventional dead zone, the so-called undead zone, and zombie zone. Combination of amplification of the radial magnetic field owing to the ambipolar diffusion and a steep radial gradient of the Ohmic diffusivity causes the efficient evacuation of the net vertical magnetic flux from the transition zone within several rotations. Surface gas accretion occurs in the coherent zone but not in the transition zone. The presence of the transition zone prohibits mass and magnetic flux transport from the coherent zone to the active zone. Mass accumulation occurs at both edges of the transition zone as a result of mass supply from the active and coherent zones.", "authors": "Kazunari Iwasaki, Kengo Tomida, Shinsuke Takasao, Satoshi Okuzumi, Takeru K.

We use 2.2 Ms Chandra and 40 ks XMM-Newton archival datasets to determine the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster gas in the merger region between the two sub-clusters in the system. These profiles exhibit temperature enhancements that imply significant heating along the merger axis. Possible sources for this heating include the shock from the ongoing merger, past activity of the powerful AGN in the core, or a combination of both. To distinguish between these scenarios, we compare the observed X-ray properties of Cygnus A with simple, spherical cluster models. These models are constructed using azimuthally averaged density and temperature profiles determined from the undisturbed regions of the cluster and folded through MARX to produce simulated Chandra observations. The thermodynamic properties in the merger region from these simulated X-ray observations were used as a baseline for comparison with the actual observations. We identify two distinct components in the temperature structure along the merger axis, a smooth, large-scale temperature excess we attribute to the ongoing merger, and a series of peaks where the temperatures are enhanced by 0.5-2.5 keV. If these peaks are attributable to the central AGN, the location and strength of these features imply that Cygnus A has been active for the past 300 Myr injecting a total of $\\sim$10$^{62}$ erg into the merger region.

The large flares last on average from 0.3 to 1 year at 22-36.8 GHz and slightly longer at 5-11.2 GHz. The optical flares are shorter and last 7-50 days. In the most active epoch of 2018-2023 the characteristic time scale $\\tau$ of variation at 5-22 GHz is about 100 days and about 1000 days for the state with lower activity in 2009-2014.

We estimated linear size of this region as 0.5-2 pc for different epochs.

Specifically, we scrutinize the thermodynamics involved in integrating a nuclear thermal reactor with an expansion turbine. This configuration facilitates the generation of substantial electrical power, which is then utilized to power an EM thruster (similar to an afterburner). This process results in a notable increase in the ISP from 900 to 1200 without the necessity for thermal radiators. Furthermore, by incorporating thermal radiators, the ISP can be further increased to approximately 4000.

These systems are among the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the universe and particularly promising candidates for multimessenger astronomy. Coincident detection of GWs and electromagnetic (EM) signals from merging MBBHs is at the frontier of contemporary astrophysics. One major challenge in observational efforts searching for these systems is the scarcity of strong predictions for EM signals arising before, during, and after merger. Therefore, a great effort in theoretical work to-date has been to characterize EM counterparts emerging from MBBHs concurrently to the GW signal, aiming to determine distinctive observational features that will guide and assist EM observations. To produce sharp EM predictions of MBBH mergers it is key to model the binary inspiral down to coalescence in a full general relativistic fashion by solving Einstein's field equations coupled with the magnetohydrodynamics equations that govern the evolution of the accreting plasma in strong-gravity. We review the general relativistic numerical investigations that have explored the astrophysical manifestations of MBBH mergers in different environments and focused on predicting potentially observable smoking-gun EM signatures that accompany the gravitational signal.", "authors": "Federico Cattorini, Bruno Giacomazzo", "date": " 4 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Aggregation and charging of mineral cloud particles under high-energy irradiation", "abstract": "It is known from Earth that ionizing high-energy radiation can lead to ion-induced nucleation of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. Since the amount of high-energy radiation can vary greatly based on the radiative environment of a host star, understanding the effect of high-energy radiation on cloud particles is critical to understand exoplanet atmospheres. This study aims to explore how high-energy radiation affects the aggregation and charging of mineral cloud particles. We present experiments conducted in an atmosphere chamber on mineral SiO$_2$ particles with diameters of 50 nm. The particles were exposed to gamma radiation in either low-humidity (RH $\\approx$ 20%) or high-humidity (RH $>$ 50%) environments. The aggregation and charging state of the particles were studied with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer. We find that the single SiO$_2$ particles (N1) cluster to form larger aggregates (N2 - N4), and that this aggregation is inhibited by gamma radiation. We find that gamma radiation shifts the charging of the particles to become more negative, by increasing the charging state of negatively charged particles. Through an independent T-test we find that this increase is statistically significant within a 5% significance level for all aggregates in the high-humidity environment, and for all except the N1 particles in the low-humidity environment. For the positively charged particles the changes in charging state are not within the 5% significance level. We suggest that the overall effect of gamma radiation could favor the formation of a high number of small particles over a lower number of larger particles.", "authors": "Nanna Bach-Møller, Christiane Helling, Uffe G.

{"title": "ARES VI: Viability of one-dimensional retrieval models for transmission spectroscopy characterization of exo-atmospheres in the era of JWST and Ariel", "abstract": "Observed exoplanet transit spectra are usually retrieved using 1D models to determine atmospheric composition while planetary atmospheres are 3D. With the JWST and future space telescopes such as Ariel, we will be able to obtain increasingly accurate transit spectra. The 3D effects on the spectra will be visible, and we can expect biases in the 1D extractions. In order to elucidate these biases, we have built theoretical observations of transit spectra, from 3D atmospheric modeling through transit modeling to instrument modeling. 3D effects are observed to be strongly nonlinear from the coldest to the hottest planets. These effects also depend on the planet's metallicity and gravity. Considering equilibrium chemistry, 3D effects are observed through very strong variations in certain features of the molecule or very small variations over the whole spectrum. We conclude that we cannot rely on the uncertainty of retrievals at all pressures, and that we must be cautious about the results of retrievals at the top of the atmosphere. However the results are still fairly close to the truth at mid-altitudes (those probed). We also need to be careful with the chemical models used for planetary atmosphere. If the chemistry of one molecule is not correctly described, this will bias all the others, and the retrieved temperature as well. Finally, although fitting a wider wavelength range and higher resolution has been shown to increase retrieval accuracy, we show that this could depend on the wavelength range chosen, due to the accuracy on modeling the different features. In any case, 1D retrievals are still correct for the detection of molecules, even in the event of an erroneous abundance retrieval.", "authors": "Adam Yassin Jaziri, William Pluriel, Andrea Bocchieri, Emilie Panek, Lucas Teinturier, Anastasiia Ivanova, Natalia E.

In contrast to most previous cosmological samples, in which SN are classified based on their spectra, we classify the DES SNe using a machine learning algorithm applied to their light curves in four photometric bands. Spectroscopic redshifts are acquired from a dedicated follow-up survey of the host galaxies. After accounting for the likelihood of each SN being a SN Ia, we find 1635 DES SN in the redshift range $0.10<z<1.13$ that pass quality selection criteria and can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. This quintuples the number of high-quality $z>0.5$ SNe compared to the previous leading compilation of Pantheon+, and results in the tightest cosmological constraints achieved by any SN data set to date. To derive cosmological constraints we combine the DES supernova data with a high-quality external low-redshift sample consisting of 194 SNe Ia spanning $0.025<z<0.10$. Using SN data alone and including systematic uncertainties we find $\\Omega_{\\rm M}=0.352\\pm 0.017$ in a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, and $(\\Omega_{\\rm M},w)=(0.264^{+0.074}_{-0.096},-0.80^{+0.14}_{-0.16})$ in a flat $w$CDM model.

{"title": "Geometric and thermodynamic characterization of binary neutron star accretion discs", "abstract": "Accretion disks formed in binary neutron star mergers play a central role in many astrophysical processes of interest, including the launching of relativistic jets or the ejection of neutron-rich matter hosting heavy element nucleosynthesis. In this work we analyze in detail the properties of accretion disks from 44 ab initio binary neutron star merger simulations for a large set of nuclear equations of state, binary mass ratios and remnant fates, with the aim of furnishing reliable initial conditions for disk simulations and a comprehensive characterization of their properties. We find that the disks have a significant thermal support, with an aspect ratio decreasing with the mass ratio of the binary from $\\sim 0.7$ to 0.3. Even if the disk sample spans a broad range in mass and angular momentum, their ratio is independent from the equation of state and from the mass ratio. This can be traced back to the rotational profile of the disc, characterized by a constant specific angular momentum (as opposed to a Keplerian one) of $3-5 \\times 10^{16} \\rm ~ cm^2~s^{-1}$. The profiles of the entropy per baryon and of the electron fraction depend on the mass ratio of the binary. For more symmetric binaries, they follow a sigmoidal distribution as a function of the rest mass density, for which we provide a detailed description and a fit. The disk properties discussed in this work can be used as a robust set of initial conditions for future long-term simulations of accretion disks from binary neutron star mergers, posing the basis for a progress in the quantitative study of the outflow properties.", "authors": "Alessandro Camilletti, Albino Perego, Federico Maria Guercilena, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, David Radice", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

Although Machine Learning (ML) methods have been extensively utilized to address this issue, the incorporation of in-depth data analysis can significantly enhance the efficiency of identifying target sources when dealing with massive volumes of astronomical data. In this work, we focused on the task of finding AGN candidates and identifying BL Lac/FSRQ candidates from the 4FGL DR3 uncertain sources. We studied the correlations among the attributes of the 4FGL DR3 catalogue and proposed a novel method, named FDIDWT, to transform the original data. The transformed dataset is characterized as low-dimensional and feature-highlighted, with the estimation of correlation features by Fractal Dimension (FD) theory and the multi-resolution analysis by Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT). Combining the FDIDWT method with an improved lightweight MatchboxConv1D model, we accomplished two missions: (1) to distinguish the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) from others (Non-AGNs) in the 4FGL DR3 uncertain sources with an accuracy of 96.65%, namely, Mission A; (2) to classify blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs) into BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) or Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with an accuracy of 92.03%, namely, Mission B.

The spectra cover the main accretion states and are characterised by the presence of hydrogen and helium emission lines, commonly observed in these objects. These show complex profiles, including double-peaks, but also blue-shifted absorptions (with blue-edge velocities of 1150 km/s), broad emission wings and flat-top profiles, which are usual signatures of accretion disc winds. Moreover, red-shifted absorptions accompanied by blue emission excesses suggest the presence of inflows in at least two epochs, although a disc origin cannot be ruled out. Using pre-outburst imaging from Pan-STARRS, we identify a candidate quiescent optical counterpart with a magnitude of g = 20.8. This implies an outburst optical amplitude of DV = 7.7, supporting an estimated orbital period of 7.6 h, which favours an early K-type companion star. Employing various empirical methods we derive a distance to the source of d = 2.7 +- 0.3 kpc, corresponding to a Galactic Plane elevation of z = 0.48 +- 0.05 kpc.

In this work, we update the general circulation model of Tan & Komacek (2019) to include a non-grey radiative transfer scheme and apply it to simulate the realistic thermal structures, phase-dependent spectra, and wavelength-dependent phase curves of UHJs. We performed grids of models over a large range of equilibrium temperatures and rotation periods for varying assumptions, showing that the fractional day-night brightness temperature differences remain almost constant or slightly increase with increasing equilibrium temperature from the visible to mid-infrared wavelengths. This differs from previous work primarily due to the increasing planetary rotation rate with increasing equilibrium temperature for fixed host star type. Radiative effects of varying atmospheric compositions become more significant in dayside brightness temperature in longer wavelengths. Data-model comparisons of dayside brightness temperatures and phase curve amplitudes as a function of equilibrium temperature are in broad agreement. Observations show a large scatter compared to models even with a range of different assumptions, indicating significantly varying intrinsic properties in the hot Jupiter population. Our cloud-free models generally struggle to match all observations for individual targets with a single set of parameter choices, indicating the need for extra processes for understanding the heat transport of UHJs.", "authors": "Xianyu Tan, Thaddeus D.

The criterion uses the second, third, and fourth derivatives of particle positions: acceleration, jerk, and snap. It can be used for choosing timesteps in integrators with adaptive step size control. For any two-body problem the criterion is guaranteed to determine the orbital period and pericenter timescale regardless of eccentricity. We discuss why our criterion is the simplest derivative-based expression for choosing adaptive timesteps with the above properties and show its superior performance over existing criteria in numerical tests. Because our criterion uses lower order derivatives, it is less susceptible to rounding errors caused by finite floating point precision. This significantly decreases the volume of phase space where an adaptive integrator fails or gets stuck due to unphysical timestep estimates. For example, our new criterion can accurately estimate timesteps for orbits around a 50m sized Solar System object located at 40AU from the coordinate origin when using double floating point precision.

In the propagation of gravitational waves, parity violation manifests by inducing amplitude and/or velocity birefringence between right- and left-circularly polarized modes. We study how the stochastic gravitational wave background can be used to place constraints on these birefringent effects. We consider two model scenarios, one in which we allow birefringent corrections to become arbitrarily large, and a second in which we impose stringent theory priors. In the former, we place constraints on a generic birefringent gravitational-wave signal due to the current non-detection of a stochastic background from compact binary events. We find a joint constraint on birefringent parameters, $\\kappa_D$ and $\\kappa_z$, of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. In the latter scenario, we forecast constraints on parity violating theories resulting from observations of the future upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network as well as proposed third-generation detectors.

A classical method to constrain maneuvers is mathematically modelling them using the Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP), defining spacecraft positions at the start and end of the trajectory. Solutions to this problem can then be obtained with optimization techniques like the nonlinear least squares conjugated with the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) to embed the constraints, which recently became an effective method for deducing orbit transfers. In this paper, we propose a tangential velocity (TV) type of constraints to design orbital maneuvers. We show that the technique presented in this paper can be used to transfer a spacecraft (e.g. from the Earth to the Moon) and perform rendezvous maneuvers (e.g. a swing-by with the Moon).

This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.", "authors": "Hamsa Padmanabhan, Abraham Loeb", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Cosmological Analysis and Systematic Uncertainties", "abstract": "We present the full Hubble diagram of photometrically-classified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey supernova program (DES-SN). DES-SN discovered more than 20,000 SN candidates and obtained spectroscopic redshifts of 7,000 host galaxies. Based on the light-curve quality, we select 1635 photometrically-identified SNe Ia with spectroscopic redshift 0.10$< z <$1.13, which is the largest sample of supernovae from any single survey and increases the number of known $z>0.5$ supernovae by a factor of five. In a companion paper, we present cosmological results of the DES-SN sample combined with 194 spectroscopically-classified SNe Ia at low redshift as an anchor for cosmological fits. Here we present extensive modeling of this combined sample and validate the entire analysis pipeline used to derive distances. We show that the statistical and systematic uncertainties on cosmological parameters are $\\sigma_{\\Omega_M,{\\rm stat+sys}}^{\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}}=$0.017 in a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, and $(\\sigma_{\\Omega_M},\\sigma_w)_{\\rm stat+sys}^{w{\\rm CDM}}=$(0.082, 0.152) in a flat $w$CDM model. Combining the DES SN data with the highly complementary CMB measurements by Planck Collaboration (2020) reduces uncertainties on cosmological parameters by a factor of 4. In all cases, statistical uncertainties dominate over systematics. We show that uncertainties due to photometric classification make up less than 10% of the total systematic uncertainty budget.

Matched filters are constructed based on the connection between the Fourier spectrum shape of the difference frame and the magnitude of the linear velocity projection onto the observation plane. Experimental data were obtained using the mobile optical surveillance system for low-orbit space objects. The detection problem in testing mode was solved for raw video data with intensity signals from three different satellites: KORONAS-FOTON, CUSAT 2/FALCON 9, GENESIS 1. Difference frames of video data with the AQUA satellite pass to construct matched filters were used. The satellites were automatically detected at points where the difference in the value of their linear velocity projection and the reference satellite was close in value. It has been established that the difference in the inclination angle between the detected satellite intensity signal Fourier image and the reference satellite mask corresponds to the difference in the inclinations of these objects. The proposed method allows not only to detect but also to study the motion parameters of both artificial and natural space objects, such as satellites, debris and asteroids.", "authors": "V.S.

While the origin of such emission is not determined yet, magnetospheric accretion is currently a most plausible hypothesis. In order to test this hypothesis further, we develop a simplified, but physical-based model and apply it to our observations taken toward HD 163296 with Subaru/SCExAO+VAMPIRES. We specify under what conditions, embedded giant planets can undergo magnetospheric accretion and emit hydrogen lines. We find that when stellar accretion rates are high, magnetospheric accretion becomes energetic enough to self-regulate the resulting emission. On the other hand, if massive planets are embedded in disks with low accretion rates, earlier formation histories determine whether magnetospheric accretion occurs. We explore two different origins of hydrogen emission lines (magnetospheric accretion flow heated by accretion-related processes vs planetary surfaces via accretion shock). The corresponding relationships between the accretion and line luminosities dictate that emission from accretion flow achieves higher line flux than that from accretion shock and the flux decreases with increasing wavelengths (i.e., from H$\\alpha$ to Pa$\\beta$ and up to Br$\\gamma$). Our observations do not detect any point-like source emitting H$\\alpha$ and are used to derive the 5$\\sigma$ detection limit. The observations are therefore not sensitive enough, and reliable examination of our model becomes possible if observational sensitivity will be improved by a factor of ten or more. Multi-band observations increase the possibility of efficiently detecting embedded giant planets and carefully determining the origin of hydrogen emission lines.", "authors": "Yasuhiro Hasegawa, Taichi Uyama, Jun Hashimoto, Yuhiko Aoyama, Vincent Deo, Olivier Guyon, Julien Lozi, Barnaby Norris, Motohide Tamura, Sebastien Vievard", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},

In September 2022, the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 went into a new outburst. Aims. The objective of this work is to examine the evolution of the accretion geometry of XTE J1701-462 by studying the spectro-polarimetric properties along the Z track of this source. The simultaneous observations archived by the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) give us the opportunity. Methods. We present a comprehensive X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis of XTE J1701-462, using simultaneous observations from IXPE, Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR. For IXPE observations, two methods are employed to measure the polarization: a model-independent measurement with PCUBE and a model-dependent polarization-spectral analysis with XSPEC. The corresponding spectra from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR are studied with two configurations that correspond to a slab-like corona and a spherical shell-like corona, respectively. Results. Significant polarization characteristics are detected in XTE J1701-462. The polarization degree shows a decreasing trend along the Z track, reducing from (4.84 $\\pm$ 0.37)% to (3.76 $\\pm$ 0.43)% on the horizontal branch and jumping to less than 1% on the normal branch. The simultaneous spectral analysis from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR suggests that the redistribution between the thermal and Comptonized emission could be the reason for the PD evolution along the Z track. Based on the correlated spectro-polarimetric properties, we propose that this source likely has a slab coronal geometry and the size/thickness of the corona decreases along the Z track.", "authors": "Wei Yu, Qingcui Bu, Victor Doroshenko, Lorenzo Ducci, Long Ji, Wenda Zhang, Andrea Santangelo, Shuangnan Zhang, Anand Waghmare, Mingyu Ge, Yue Huang, Hexin Liu, Lian Tao, Zixu Yang, Liang Zhang, Jinlu Qu", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect. We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters. We also determine the parameter space where the acceleration is large enough that the wave phase model would have to be extended to nonlinear orders in the acceleration.", "authors": "Malcolm Lazarow, Nathaniel Leslie, Liang Dai", "date": " 8 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "FlopPITy: Enabling self-consistent exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with machine learning", "abstract": "Interpreting the observations of exoplanet atmospheres to constrain physical and chemical properties is typically done using Bayesian retrieval techniques. Because these methods require many model computations, a compromise is made between model complexity and run time. Reaching this compromise leads to the simplification of many physical and chemical processes (e.g. parameterised temperature structure). Here we implement and test sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), a machine learning inference algorithm, for exoplanet atmospheric retrievals. The goal is to speed up retrievals so they can be run with more computationally expensive atmospheric models, such as those computing the temperature structure using radiative transfer. We generate 100 synthetic observations using ARCiS (ARtful Modeling Code for exoplanet Science, an atmospheric modelling code with the flexibility to compute models in varying degrees of complexity) and perform retrievals on them to test the faithfulness of the SNPE posteriors. The faithfulness quantifies whether the posteriors contain the ground truth as often as we expect. We also generate a synthetic observation of a cool brown dwarf using the self-consistent capabilities of ARCiS and run a retrieval with self-consistent models to showcase the possibilities that SNPE opens. We find that SNPE provides faithful posteriors and is therefore a reliable tool for exoplanet atmospheric retrievals. We are able to run a self-consistent retrieval of a synthetic brown dwarf spectrum using only 50,000 forward model evaluations. We find that SNPE can speed up retrievals between $\\sim2\\times$ and $\\geq10\\times$ depending on the computational load of the forward model, the dimensionality of the observation, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the observation.

In addition, we also identify a radio source with the recently discovered millisecond pulsar PSR 1737-0314A. The brightest X-ray source, CX1, appears to be consistent with the nominal position of the classic nova Ophiuchi 1938 (Oph 1938), and both Oph 1938 and CX1 are consistent with a UV-bright variable HST counterpart, which we argue to be the source of the nova eruption in 1938. This makes Oph 1938 the second classic nova recovered in a Galactic GC since Nova T Scorpii in M80. CX2 is consistent with the steep-spectrum radio source VLA8, which unambiguously matches a faint blue source; the steepness of VLA8 is suggestive of a pulsar nature, possibly a transitional millisecond pulsar with a late K dwarf companion, though an active galactic nucleus (AGN) cannot be ruled out.

Next we consider cuts in Galactic latitude and longitude to probe residual foreground contaminations from the Galactic Plane and Center.

The main science target of the pipeline are bright nearby FRBs from the local Universe which are the best candidates to probe FRB progenitors and understand physical mechanisms powering these extremely energetic events. The new MWA beamformer, known as the \"MWAX multibeam beamformer\", can form multiple incoherent and coherent beams commensally to any on-going MWA observations. One of the beams is currently used for FRB searches (tested in 10 kHz frequency resolution and time resolutions between 0.1 and 100 ms). A second beam is used for a Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). This paper focuses on the FRB search pipeline and its verification on selected known bright pulsars. The pipeline uses the FREDDA implementation of the Fast Dispersion Measure Transform algorithm (FDMT) for single pulse searches. Initially, it was tested during standard MWA observations, and more recently using dedicated observations of selected 11 bright pulsars. The pulsar PSR J0835-4510 (aka Vela) has been routinely used as the primary probe of the data quality because its folded profile was always detected in the frequency band 200 - 230 MHz with typical SNR >10. Similarly, the low DM pulsar PSR B0950+08 was always detected in folded profile in the frequency band 140 - 170 MHz, and so far has been the only object for which single pulses were detected. We present the estimated sensitivity of the search in the currently limited observing bandwidth of a single MWA coarse channel (1.28 MHz) and for the upgraded, future system with 12.8 MHz (10 channels) of bandwidth.

{"title": "Resolving Galactic center GeV excess with MSP-like sources", "abstract": "Excess of gamma-rays with a spherical morphology around the Galactic center (GC) observed in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data is one of the most intriguing features in the gamma-ray sky. The spherical morphology and the spectral energy distribution with a peak around a few GeV are consistent with emission from annihilation of dark matter particles. Other possible explanations include a distribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). One of the caveats of the MSP hypothesis is the relatively small number of associated MSPs near the GC. In this paper we perform a multi-class classification of Fermi-LAT sources using machine learning and determine the contribution from MSP-like sources among unassociated Fermi-LAT sources near the GC. We find that the unassociated MSP-like sources have a spectral energy distribution that is comparable with the GC excess if the contribution from the Fermi bubbles is taken into account. The spatial morphology and the source count distribution are also consistent with expectations for a population of MSPs that can explain the gamma-ray excess.

{"title": "A deep learning framework for jointly extracting spectra and source-count distributions in astronomy", "abstract": "Astronomical observations typically provide three-dimensional maps, encoding the distribution of the observed flux in (1) the two angles of the celestial sphere and (2) energy/frequency. An important task regarding such maps is to statistically characterize populations of point sources too dim to be individually detected. As the properties of a single dim source will be poorly constrained, instead one commonly studies the population as a whole, inferring a source-count distribution (SCD) that describes the number density of sources as a function of their brightness. Statistical and machine learning methods for recovering SCDs exist; however, they typically entirely neglect spectral information associated with the energy distribution of the flux. We present a deep learning framework able to jointly reconstruct the spectra of different emission components and the SCD of point-source populations. In a proof-of-concept example, we show that our method accurately extracts even complex-shaped spectra and SCDs from simulated maps.", "authors": "Florian Wolf, Florian List, Nicholas L.

Fulfilling this potential requires a large sample of GRBs with known redshifts, but due to observational limitations, only 11\\% have known redshifts ($z$). There have been numerous attempts to estimate redshifts via correlation studies, most of which have led to inaccurate predictions. To overcome this, we estimated GRB redshift via an ensemble supervised machine learning model that uses X-ray afterglows of long-duration GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The estimated redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) and have a root mean square error, namely the square root of the average squared error $\\langle\\Delta z^2\\rangle$, of 0.46 with the observed redshifts showing the reliability of this method. The addition of GRB afterglow parameters improves the predictions considerably by 63\\% compared to previous results in peer-reviewed literature.

Similarity solutions to the compressible hydrodynamics equations are developed, for a strong shock wave, generated by a time dependent pressure piston, propagating in a non-homogeneous planar medium consisting of an ideal gas. Power law temporal and spatial dependency is assumed for the piston pressure and initial medium density, respectively. The similarity solutions are written in both Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates. It is shown that the solutions take various qualitatively different forms according to the value of the pressure and density exponents. We show that there exist different families of solutions for which the shock propagates at constant speed, accelerates or slows down. Similarly, we show that there exist different types of solutions for which the density near the piston is either finite, vanishes or diverges. Finally, we perform a comprehensive comparison between the planar shock solutions and Lagrangian hydrodynamic simulations, by setting proper initial and boundary conditions. A very good agreement is reached, which demonstrates the usefulness of the analytic solutions as a code verification test problem.", "authors": "Menahem Krief", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

More interestingly, the X-ray flare/bump for those seven GRBs are simultaneously observed in $\\gamma-$ray band. By adopting the propeller-fallback-accretion model to fit the observed data, it is found that the free parameters of two GRBs (140512A and 180329B) can be constrained very well, while the other five cases, more or less, are not all sufficiently constrained. On the other hand, it requires that the conversion efficiency of propeller is two or three times higher than that of spin-down dipole radiation of magnetar. If this is the case, it is contradictory to the expectation from the propeller model, namely, a dirtier ejecta should be less efficient in producing $\\gamma-$ray emissions.

Recently, an interesting long-duration GRB 230307A with redshift $z=$0.065 has attracted great attention. The lack of detected thermal emission and mini-structure of prompt emission lightcurve of this burst suggest that the outflow is Poynting-flux-dominated and point towards the ICMART model. In this paper, we invoke two independent methods to investigate the jet composition of GRB 230307A. The high magnetization parameter ($\\sigma>7$ or ever large) for$R_0=10^{10}$ cm that is used to suppress thermal component, strongly suggests that a significant fraction of the outflow energy is likely in a Poynting flux entrained with the baryonic matter. Moreover, it is found that the radiation efficiency of this burst for typical values $\\epsilon_e=0.1$ and $\\epsilon_B=0.01$ can reach as high as $~50\\%$ which disfavors the internal shock model, but is consistent with ICMART model.

A great benefit comes from the porting of existing codes running on standard processors to GPU-based platforms. However, this usually requires a drastic rewriting of the original code, the use of specific languages like CUDA, and a complex analysis of data management and optimization of parallel processes. Here we describe the porting of the ECHO code for special and general relativistic MHD to accelerated devices, simply based on native Fortran language built-in constructs, especially 'do concurrent' loops, few OpenACC directives, and the straightforward data management provided by the Unified Memory option of NVIDIA compilers.Thanks to these very minor modifications to the original code, the new version of ECHO runs at least 16 times faster on GPU platforms compared to CPU-based ones.

Surprising discoveries include: 1) a web-like network of unshocked ejecta filaments resolved to 0.01 pc scales exhibiting an overall morphology consistent with turbulent mixing of cool, low-entropy matter from the progenitor's oxygen layer with hot, neutrino and radioactively heated high-entropy matter, 2) a thick sheet of dust-dominated emission from shocked CSM seen in projection toward the remnant's interior pockmarked with small (approximately one arcsecond) round holes formed by knots of high-velocity ejecta that have pierced through the CSM and driven expanding tangential shocks, 3) dozens of light echoes with angular sizes between 0.1 arcsecond to 1 arcminute reflecting previously unseen fine-scale structure in the ISM.

{"title": "Survivability of Amorphous Ice in Comets Depends on the Latent Heat of Crystallization of Impure Water Ice", "abstract": "Comets would have amorphous ice rather than crystalline one at the epoch of their accretion. Cometary ice contains some impurities that govern the latent heat of ice crystallization, $L_{\\rm cry}$. However, it is still controversial whether the crystallization process is exothermic or endothermic. In this study, we perform one-dimensional simulations of the thermal evolution of km-sized comets and investigate the effect of the latent heat. We find that the depth where amorphous ice can survive significantly depends on the latent heat of ice crystallization. Assuming the cometary radius of 2 km, the depth of the amorphous ice mantle is approximately 100 m when the latent heat is positive (i.e., the exothermic case with $L_{\\rm cry} = + 9 \\times 10^{4}$ J/kg). In contrast, when we consider the impure ice representing the endothermic case with $L_{\\rm cry} = - 9 \\times 10^{4}$ J/kg, the depth of the amorphous ice mantle could exceed 1 km. Although our numerical results indicate that these depths depend on the size and the accretion age of comets, the depth in a comet with the negative latent heat is a few to several times larger than the positive case for a given comet size. This work suggests that the spatial distribution of the ice crystallinity in a comet nucleus depends on the latent heat, which can be different from the previous estimates assuming pure water ice.", "authors": "Sota Arakawa, Shigeru Wakita", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

We employ both a non-linear force-free field model and a potential field model to reconstruct the coronal magnetic field, aiming to understand its magnetic properties. Two precursor jet-like activities were observed before the eruption, displaying an untwisted rotation. The second activity released an estimated twist of over two turns. During these two jet-like activities, Y-shaped brightenings, newly emerging magnetic flux accompanied by magnetic cancellation, and the formation of newly moving fibrils were identified. Combining these observational features, it can be inferred that these two precursor jet-like activities released the magnetic field constraining the filament and were triggered by newly emerging magnetic flux. Before the filament eruption, it was observed that some moving flows had been ejected from the site as the onset of two jet-like activities, indicating the same physical process as two jet-like activities. Extrapolations revealed that the filament laid under the height of the decay index of 1.0 and had strong magnetic field (540 Gauss) and a high twisted number (2.4 turns) before the eruption. An apparent rotational motion was observed during the filament eruption. We deduce that the solar filament, exhibiting an inverted U-shape, is a significantly twisted flux rope. The eruption of the filament was initiated by the release of constraining magnetic fields through continuous magnetic reconnection. This reconnection process was triggered by the emergence of newly magnetic flux.", "authors": "Jincheng Wang, Xiaoli Yan, Qiangwei Cai, Zhike Xue, Liheng Yang, Qiaoling Li, Zhe Xu, Yunfang Cai, Liping Yang, Yang Peng, Xia Sun, Xinsheng Zhang, Yian Zhou", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

These structures are also closely related to HI filaments with coherent velocity structures. There is a long-standing debate about the physical nature of these structures. They are considered either as velocity caustics, fluctuations engraved by the turbulent velocity field or as cold three-dimensional density structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). We discuss different approaches to data analysis and interpretation in order to work out the differences. We considered mathematical preliminaries for the derivation of caustics that characterize filamentary structures in the ISM. Using the Hessian operator, we traced individual FIR filamentary structures in HI from channel maps as observed and alternatively from data that are provided by the velocity decomposition algorithm (VDA). VDA is claimed to separate velocity caustics from density effects. Based on the strict mathematical definition, the so-called velocity caustics are not actually caustics. These VDA data products may contain caustics in the same way as the original HI observations. Caustics derived by a Hessian analysis of both databases are nearly identical with a correlation coefficient of 98%. However, the VDA algorithm leads to a 30% increase in the alignment uncertainties when fitting FIR/HI orientation angles. We used HI absorption data to constrain the physical nature of FIR/HI filaments and determine spin temperatures and volume densities of FIR/HI filaments. HI filaments exist as CNM structures; outside the filaments no CNM absorption is detectable. The CNM in the diffuse ISM is exclusively located in filaments with FIR counterparts. These filaments at high Galactic latitudes exist as cold density structures; velocity crowding effects are negligible.", "authors": "P.M.W. Kalberla", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},

Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated has increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. The paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources, type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies. However, there are also common sets of Best Practices.", "authors": "Observatory Bibliographers Collaboration, Raffaele D'Abrusco, Monique Gomez, Uta Grothkopf, Sharon Hunt, Ruth Kneale, Mika Konuma, Jenny Novacescu, Luisa Rebull, Elena Scire, Erin Scott, Donna Thompson, Lance Utley, Christopher Wilkinson, Sherry Winkelman", "date": " 29 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Are Lithium-Rich Giants Binaries?: A Radial Velocity Variability Analysis of 1,400 Giants", "abstract": "Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain them involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this scenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We develop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for the giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus possibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that stage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.", "authors": "Matias Castro-Tapia, Julio Chanamé, Claudia Aguilera-Gómez", "date": " 29 Dec 2023"},

Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) accelerated by the blast have reached Earth, up to an almost S3 (strong) category of a radiation storm on the NOAA scale.

A Monte Carlo spectral analysis based on muon excess at New-Tupi is consistent with the acceleration of electrons and protons (ions) up to relativistic energies (GeV energy range) in the impulsive phase of the flare.

{"title": "The link among X-ray spectral properties, AGN structure and the host galaxy", "abstract": "In this work, we compare the SMBH and host galaxy properties of X-ray obscured and unobscured AGN. For that purpose, we use $\\sim 35 000$ X-ray detected AGN in the 4XMM-DR11 catalogue for which there are available measurements for their X-ray spectral parameters, from the XMM2Athena Horizon 2020 European project. We calculate the host galaxy properties via SED fitting analysis. Our final sample consists of 1 443 AGN. In the first part of our analysis, we use different N$_H$ thresholds (10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ or 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$), taking also into account the uncertainties associated with the N$_H$ measurements, to classify these sources into obscured and unobscured. We find that obscured AGN tend to live in more massive systems that have lower SFR compared to their unobscured counterparts. However, only the difference in stellar mass, M$_*$, appears statistically significant ($>2\\sigma$). The results do not depend on the N$_H$ threshold used to classify AGN. The differences in M$_*$ and SFR are not statistically significant for luminous AGN ($\\rm log (L_{X,2-10 KeV}/erg s^{-1})> 44$). Our findings also show that unobscured AGN have, on average, higher specific black hole accretion rates compared to their obscured counterparts. In the second part of our analysis, we cross-match the 1 443 X-ray AGN with the SDSS DR16 quasar catalogue to obtain information on the SMBH properties of our sources. This results in 271 type 1 AGN, at $\\rm z<1.9$. Our findings show that type 1 AGN with increased N$_H$ ($>10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) tend to have higher M$_{BH}$ compared to AGN with lower N$_H$ values, at similar M$_*$. The M$_{BH}$/M$_*$ ratio remains consistent for N$_H$ values below 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, but it exhibits signs of an increase at higher N$_H$ values.

This paper presents two strategies for evaluating these subsidiary metrics under a policy that is optimal for the primary one. The first relies on a novel margin condition that facilitates Wald-type inference. Under this and other regularity conditions, we show that the one-step corrected estimator is efficient. Despite the utility of this margin condition, it places strong restrictions on how the subsidiary metric behaves for nearly optimal policies, which may not hold in practice. We therefore introduce alternative, two-stage strategies that do not require a margin condition. The first stage constructs a set of candidate policies and the second builds a uniform confidence interval over this set.

This paper considers a general framework of noisy low-rank-plus-sparse matrix recovery, where the noise matrix may come from any joint distribution with arbitrary dependence across entries. We propose an incoherent-constrained least-square estimator and prove its tightness both in the sense of deterministic lower bound and matching minimax risks under various noise distributions. To attain this, we establish a novel result asserting that the difference between two arbitrary low-rank incoherent matrices must spread energy out across its entries, in other words cannot be too sparse, which sheds light on the structure of incoherent low-rank matrices and may be of independent interest. We then showcase the applications of our framework to several important statistical machine learning problems. In the problem of estimating a structured Markov transition kernel, the proposed method achieves the minimax optimality and the result can be extended to estimating the conditional mean operator, a crucial component in reinforcement learning. The applications to multitask regression and structured covariance estimation are also presented.

For audio classification tasks, the Audio Spectrogram Transformer model shows impressive results. However, surprisingly, how to efficiently adapt it to several downstream tasks has not been tackled before. In this paper, we bridge this gap and present a detailed investigation of common parameter-efficient methods, revealing that adapters and LoRA consistently outperform the other methods across four benchmarks.

{"title": "A multimodal dynamical variational autoencoder for audiovisual speech representation learning", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multimodal and dynamical VAE (MDVAE) applied to unsupervised audio-visual speech representation learning. The latent space is structured to dissociate the latent dynamical factors that are shared between the modalities from those that are specific to each modality. A static latent variable is also introduced to encode the information that is constant over time within an audiovisual speech sequence. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on an audiovisual emotional speech dataset, in two stages. In the first stage, a vector quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) is learned independently for each modality, without temporal modeling. The second stage consists in learning the MDVAE model on the intermediate representation of the VQ-VAEs before quantization. The disentanglement between static versus dynamical and modality-specific versus modality-common information occurs during this second training stage. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate how audiovisual speech latent factors are encoded in the latent space of MDVAE. These experiments include manipulating audiovisual speech, audiovisual facial image denoising, and audiovisual speech emotion recognition. The results show that MDVAE effectively combines the audio and visual information in its latent space. They also show that the learned static representation of audiovisual speech can be used for emotion recognition with few labeled data, and with better accuracy compared with unimodal baselines and a state-of-the-art supervised model based on an audiovisual transformer architecture.", "authors": "Samir Sadok, Simon Leglaive, Laurent Girin, Xavier Alameda-Pineda, Renaud Séguier", "date": " 5 May 2023 ("},

Despite the popularity of DNN based segmentation on the research side, these techniques are almost unused in the daily clinical practice even if they could support effectively the physician during the diagnostic process. Apart from the issues related to the explainability of the predictions of a neural model, such systems are not integrated in the diagnostic workflow, and a standardization of their use is needed to achieve this goal. Methods: This paper presents IODeep a new DICOM Information Object Definition (IOD) aimed at storing both the weights and the architecture of a DNN already trained on a particular image dataset that is labeled as regards the acquisition modality, the anatomical region, and the disease under investigation. Results: The IOD architecture is presented along with a DNN selection algorithm from the PACS server based on the labels outlined above, and a simple PACS viewer purposely designed for demonstrating the effectiveness of the DICOM integration, while no modifications are required on the PACS server side.

To address these issues, we propose in this paper new and efficient beam training schemes with off-grid range estimation by using conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook. Specifically, we first analyze the received beam pattern at the user when far-field beamforming vectors are used for beam scanning, and show an interesting result that this beam pattern contains useful user angle and range information. Then, we propose two efficient schemes to jointly estimate the user angle and range with the DFT codebook. The first scheme estimates the user angle based on a defined angular support and resolves the user range by leveraging an approximated angular support width, while the second scheme estimates the user range by minimizing a power ratio mean square error (MSE) to improve the range estimation accuracy. Finally, numerical simulations show that our proposed schemes greatly reduce the near-field beam training overhead and improve the range estimation accuracy as compared to various benchmark schemes.", "authors": "Xun Wu, Changsheng You, Jiapeng Li, Yunpu Zhang", "date": " 21 Sep 2023 ("},

Compared with the conventional far-field beam training method that searches for the best beam direction only, the near-field beam training is more challenging since it requires a beam search over both the angular and distance domains due to the spherical wavefront propagation model. To reduce the near-field beam-training overhead based on the two-dimensional exhaustive search, we propose in this letter a new two-phase beam training method that decomposes the two-dimensional search into two sequential phases. Specifically, in the first phase, the candidate angles of the user is determined by a new method based on the conventional far-field codebook and angle-domain beam sweeping. Then, a customized polar-domain codebook is employed in the second phase to find the best effective distance of the user given the shortlisted candidate angles.

To address this issue, we propose in this paper an efficient two-stage hierarchical beam training method for near-field communications. Specifically, in the first stage, we employ the central sub-array of the XL-array to search for a coarse user direction in the angular domain with conventional far-field hierarchical codebook. Then, in the second stage, given the coarse user direction, we progressively search for the fine-grained user direction-and-distance in the polar domain with a dedicatedly designed codebook.

These Wi-Fi-based methods exhibit several advantages over conventional state-of-the-art techniques that rely on cameras and sensors, including lower costs and ease of deployment. However, a significant challenge associated with Wi-Fi-based HAR is the significant decline in performance when the scene or subject changes. To mitigate this issue, it is imperative to train the model using an extensive dataset. In recent studies, the utilization of CNN-based models or sequence-to-sequence models such as LSTM, GRU, or Transformer has become prevalent.

Most existing deep learning (DL)-based task-oriented communication systems adopt a closed-world scenario, assuming either the same data distribution for training and testing, or the system could have access to a large out-of-distribution (OoD) dataset for retraining. However, in practical open-world scenarios, task-oriented communication systems need to handle unknown OoD data. Under such circumstances, the powerful approximation ability of learning methods may force the task-oriented communication systems to overfit the training data (i.e., in-distribution data) and provide overconfident judgments when encountering OoD data. Based on the information bottleneck (IB) framework, we propose a class conditional IB (CCIB) approach to address this problem in this paper, supported by information-theoretical insights. The idea is to extract distinguishable features from in-distribution data while keeping their compactness and informativeness. This is achieved by imposing the class conditional latent prior distribution and enforcing the latent of different classes to be far away from each other. Simulation results shall demonstrate that the proposed approach detects OoD data more efficiently than the baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, without compromising the rate-distortion tradeoff.", "authors": "Hongru Li, Wentao Yu, Hengtao He, Jiawei Shao, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B.

Also, our analysis reveals that certain algorithm design choices commonly employed in practice, particularly, nonlinear parameterizations of the scale of the variational approximation, can result in suboptimal convergence rates. Fortunately, running BBVI with proximal stochastic gradient descent fixes these limitations, and thus achieves the strongest known convergence rate guarantees.

Usually, specular reflections of the radio signals occurring at flat surfaces are modeled by virtual anchors (VAs) that are mirror images of the physical anchors (PAs). In existing methods for multipath-based SLAM, each VA is assumed to generate only a single measurement. However, due to imperfections of the measurement equipment such as non-calibrated antennas or model mismatch due to roughness of the reflective surfaces, there are potentially multiple multipath components (MPCs) that are associated to one single VA. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian particle-based sum-product algorithm (SPA) for multipath-based SLAM that can cope with multiple-measurements being associated to a single VA. Furthermore, we introduce a novel statistical measurement model that is strongly related to the radio signal. It introduces additional dispersion parameters into the likelihood function to capture additional MPCs-related measurements.

The beamformer represents a crucial component of an ultrasound machine, playing a significant role in shaping the ultimate quality of the reconstructed image. Therefore, Transmit Beam Pattern (TBP) optimization is an important task in medical ultrasound, but state-of-the-art TBP optimization has well-known drawbacks like non-uniform beam width over depth, presence of significant side lobes, and quick energy drop out after the focal depth. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel optimization approach for TBP by focusing the analysis on its narrowband approximation, particularly suited for Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) elastography, and considering transmit delays as free variables instead of linked to a specific focal depth. We formulate the problem as a non linear Least Squares problem to minimize the difference between the TBP corresponding to a set of delays and the desired one, modeled as a 2D rectangular shape elongated in the direction of the beam axis. In order to quantitatively evaluate the results, we define three quality metrics based on main lobe width, side lobe level, and central line power. Results obtained by our synthetic software simulation show that the main lobe width is considerably more intense and uniform over the whole depth range with respect to classical focalized Beam Patterns, and our optimized delay profile results in a combination of standard delay profiles at different focal depths. The application of the proposed method to ARFI elastography shows improvements in the concentration of the ultrasound energy along a desired axis.", "authors": "Chiara Razzetta, Valentina Candiani, Marco Crocco, Federico Benvenuto", "date": " 13 Sep 2022 ("},

In this paper, we propose a unified and powerful deep lossy plus residual (DLPR) coding framework for both lossless and near-lossless image compression. In the lossless mode, the DLPR coding system first performs lossy compression and then lossless coding of residuals. We solve the joint lossy and residual compression problem in the approach of VAEs, and add autoregressive context modeling of the residuals to enhance lossless compression performance.

To arrive at a smoother representation of the network's generative mechanism, we explicitly trade variance for bias by smoothing blocks of edges based on stochastic equivalence. As such, we propose a different estimation method using a new model, which we call the stochastic shape model. Typically, analysis methods are based on modelling node or link communities. In contrast, we take a hybrid approach, bridging the two notions of community. Consequently, we obtain a more parsimonious representation, enabling a more interpretable and multiscale summary of the network structure. By considering multiple resolutions, we trade bias and variance to ensure that our estimator is rate-optimal. We also examine the performance of our model through simulations and applications to real network data.", "authors": "Arthur Verdeyme, Sofia C. Olhede", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

We relax the problem of testing MCAR to the problem of testing the compatibility of a sequence of covariance matrices, motivated by the fact that this procedure is feasible when the dimension grows with the sample size. Tests of compatibility can be used to test the feasibility of positive semi-definite matrix completion problems with noisy observations, and thus our results may be of independent interest. Our first contributions are to define a natural measure of the incompatibility of a sequence of correlation matrices, which can be characterised as the optimal value of a Semi-definite Programming (SDP) problem, and to establish a key duality result allowing its practical computation and interpretation. By studying the concentration properties of the natural plug-in estimator of this measure, we introduce novel hypothesis tests that we prove have power against all distributions with incompatible covariance matrices. The choice of critical values for our tests rely on a new concentration inequality for the Pearson sample correlation matrix, which may be of interest more widely. By considering key examples of missingness structures, we demonstrate that our procedures are minimax rate optimal in certain cases. We further validate our methodology with numerical simulations that provide evidence of validity and power, even when data are heavy tailed.", "authors": "Alberto Bordino, Thomas B.

Using the telEPOC program we use telemonitoring data to analyze the impact of physical activity adopting a functional data approach. However, Traditional functional data methods, including functional regression models, typically assume a consistent data domain. However, the data in the telEPOC program exhibits variable domains, presenting a challenge since the majority of functional data methods, are based on the fact that data are observed in the same domain. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel fully functional methodology tailored to variable domain functional data, eliminating the need for data alignment, which can be computationally taxing. Although models designed for variable domain data are relatively scarce and may have inherent limitations in their estimation methods, our approach circumvents these issues. We substantiate the effectiveness of our methodology through a simulation study, comparing our results with those obtained using established methodologies.

{"title": "A general theory for robust clustering via trimmed mean", "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental tool in statistical machine learning in the presence of heterogeneous data. Many recent results focus primarily on optimal mislabeling guarantees, when data are distributed around centroids with sub-Gaussian errors. Yet, the restrictive sub-Gaussian model is often invalid in practice, since various real-world applications exhibit heavy tail distributions around the centroids or suffer from possible adversarial attacks that call for robust clustering with a robust data-driven initialization. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid clustering technique with a novel multivariate trimmed mean type centroid estimate to produce mislabeling guarantees under a weak initialization condition for general error distributions around the centroids. A matching lower bound is derived, up to factors depending on the number of clusters. In addition, our approach also produces the optimal mislabeling even in the presence of adversarial outliers. Our results reduce to the sub-Gaussian case when errors follow sub-Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem thoroughly, we also present novel data-driven robust initialization techniques and show that, with probabilities approaching one, these initial centroid estimates are sufficiently good for the subsequent clustering algorithm to achieve the optimal mislabeling rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Lloyd algorithm is suboptimal for more than two clusters even when errors are Gaussian, and for two clusters when errors distributions have heavy tails. Both simulated data and real data examples lend further support to both of our robust initialization procedure and clustering algorithm.", "authors": "Soham Jana, Jianqing Fan, Sanjeev Kulkarni", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

Under the assumption that the observations are modeled by a Poisson distribution, we are interested in simultaneous testing of the means of those observations. In this work, we study some optimal properties (in terms of Bayes risk) of multiple-testing rules induced by both two-groups and a general class of one-group shrinkage priors. The class of one-group priors was proposed by Polson and Scott (2010) and studied by Ghosh et al. (2016) in the context of the normal means model and by Tang et al. (2018) for the linear regression model. Here, first, we model each mean by a two-groups prior, and under the assumption of $0-1$ loss function, we obtain an expression for the optimal Bayes risk under some assumption similar to Bogdan et al. (2011). Next, same as Ghosh et al. (2016), we assume a two-groups mixture model for the data and model each mean parameter by the broad class of one-group priors to study the Bayes risk induced by the chosen class of priors. We have been able to show that, when the underlying sparsity pattern is known, under some proposed assumptions, the Bayes risk corresponding to the broad class of priors attains the optimal Bayes risk exactly. In other words, it ensures the decision rule is Asymptotically Bayes optimal under sparsity (ABOS). When this sparsity is unknown, motivated by Yano et al. (2021), we use an empirical Bayes estimate of the global shrinkage parameter. In this case, also, we show that the modified decision rule is ABOS, too. In this way, as an alternative solution for two-groups prior, we propose a broad class of global-local priors having similar optimal properties in terms of Bayes risk to quasi-sparse count data.", "authors": "Sayantan Paul, and Arijit Chakrabarti", "date": " 11 Jan 2024"},

Forecasts of influenza-like illness (ILI) -- a surrogate for the proportion of patients infected with influenza -- support public health decision making. The goal of an ensemble forecast of ILI is to increase accuracy and calibration compared to individual forecasts and to provide a single, cohesive prediction of future influenza. However, an ensemble may be composed of models that produce similar forecasts, causing issues with ensemble forecast performance and non-identifiability. To improve upon the above issues we propose a novel Cluster-Aggregate-Pool or `CAP' ensemble algorithm that first clusters together individual forecasts, aggregates individual models that belong to the same cluster into a single forecast (called a cluster forecast), and then pools together cluster forecasts via a linear pool. When compared to a non-CAP approach, we find that a CAP ensemble improves calibration by approximately 10% while maintaining similar accuracy to non-CAP alternatives. In addition, our CAP algorithm (i) generalizes past ensemble work associated with influenza forecasting and introduces a framework for future ensemble work, (ii) automatically accounts for missing forecasts from individual models, (iii) allows public health officials to participate in the ensemble by assigning individual models to clusters, and (iv) provide an additional signal about when peak influenza may be near.", "authors": "Ningxi Wei, Xinze Zhou, Wei-Min Huang, Thomas McAndrew", "date": " 29 Dec 2023"},

Building on a recent strand of the literature, we propose an extended framework for the analysis of longitudinal studies, where units can die at different time points, and the main endpoints are observed and well defined only up to the death time. We develop a Bayesian longitudinal principal stratification framework, where units are cross classified according to the longitudinal death status. Under this framework, the focus is on causal effects for the principal strata of units that would be alive up to a time point s irrespective of their treatment assignment, where these strata may vary as a function of s. We can get precious insights into the effects of treatment by inspecting the distribution of baseline characteristics within each longitudinal principal stratum, and by investigating the time trend of both principal stratum membership and survivor-average causal effects. We illustrate our approach for the analysis of a longitudinal observational study aimed to assess, under the assumption of strong ignorability of treatment assignment, the causal effects of a policy promoting start ups on firms survival and hiring policy, where firms hiring status is censored by death.", "authors": "Giulio Grossi, Marco Mariani, Alessandra Mattei, Fabrizia Mealli", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Stratified distance space improves the efficiency of sequential samplers for approximate Bayesian computation", "abstract": "Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods are standard tools for inferring parameters of complex models when the likelihood function is analytically intractable. A popular approach to improving the poor acceptance rate of the basic rejection sampling ABC algorithm is to use sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC) to produce a sequence of proposal distributions adapting towards the posterior, instead of generating values from the prior distribution of the model parameters. Proposal distribution for the subsequent iteration is typically obtained from a weighted set of samples, often called particles, of the current iteration of this sequence. Current methods for constructing these proposal distributions treat all the particles equivalently, regardless of the corresponding value generated by the sampler, which may lead to inefficiency when propagating the information across iterations of the algorithm. To improve sampler efficiency, we introduce a modified approach called stratified distance ABC SMC. Our algorithm stratifies particles based on their distance between the corresponding synthetic and observed data, and then constructs distinct proposal distributions for all the strata. Taking into account the distribution of distances across the particle space leads to substantially improved acceptance rate of the rejection sampling. We further show that efficiency can be gained by introducing a novel stopping rule for the sequential process based on the stratified posterior samples and demonstrate these advances by several examples.", "authors": "Henri Pesonen, Jukka Corander", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Alternative Approaches for Computing Highest-Density Regions", "abstract": "Many statistical problems require estimating a density function, say $f$, from data samples. In this work, for example, we are interested in highest-density regions (HDRs), i.e., minimum volume sets that contain a given probability. HDRs are typically computed using a density quantile approach, which, in the case of unknown densities, involves their estimation. This task turns out to be far from trivial, especially over increased dimensions and when data are sparse and exhibit complex structures (e.g., multimodalities or particular dependencies). We address this challenge by exploring alternative approaches to build HDRs that overcome direct (multivariate) density estimation. First, we generalize the density quantile method, currently implementable on the basis of a consistent estimator of the density, to $neighbourhood$ measures, i.e., measures that preserve the order induced in the sample by $f$. Second, we discuss a number of suitable probabilistic- and distance-based measures such as the $k$-nearest neighbourhood Euclidean distance. Third, motivated by the ubiquitous role of $copula$ modeling in modern statistics, we explore its use in the context of probabilistic-based measures.

We embrace the skeptical perspective, and elaborate a novel mixture prior which incorporates skepticism while at the same time controlling for prior-data conflict within the original data. Consistency properties of the resulting skeptical mixture BF are provided together with an extensive analysis of the main features of our proposal.

{"title": "Detecting Imprinting and Maternal Effects Using Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization Algorithm", "abstract": "Numerous statistical methods have been developed to explore genomic imprinting and maternal effects, which are causes of parent-of-origin patterns in complex human diseases. However, most of them either only model one of these two confounded epigenetic effects, or make strong yet unrealistic assumptions about the population to avoid over-parameterization. A recent partial likelihood method (LIME) can identify both epigenetic effects based on case-control family data without those assumptions. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown its validity and robustness. However, because LIME obtains parameter estimation by maximizing partial likelihood, it is interesting to compare its efficiency with full likelihood maximizer. To overcome the difficulty in over-parameterization when using full likelihood, in this study we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) method to detect imprinting and maternal effects jointly. Those unknown mating type probabilities, the nuisance parameters, can be considered as latent variables in EM algorithm. Monte Carlo samples are used to numerically approximate the expectation function that cannot be solved algebraically. Our simulation results show that though this MCEM algorithm takes longer computational time, and can give higher bias in some simulations compared to LIME, it can generally detect both epigenetic effects with higher power and smaller standard error which demonstrates that it can be a good complement of LIME method.", "authors": "Pooya Aavani, Alexandre Trindade, Fangyuan Zhang", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},

The points at which the process is observed need not have any particular spatial structure beyond quasi-uniformity.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a prevalent and pivotal technique for statistically validating the covariance structure of latent common factors derived from multiple observed variables. In contrast to other factor analysis methods, CFA offers a flexible covariance modeling approach for common factors, enhancing the interpretability of relationships between the common factors, as well as between common factors and observations. However, the application of classic CFA models faces dual barriers: the lack of a prerequisite specification of \"non-zero loadings\" or factor membership (i.e., categorizing the observations into distinct common factors), and the formidable computational burden in high-dimensional scenarios where the number of observed variables surpasses the sample size. To bridge these two gaps, we propose the SCFA model by integrating the underlying high-dimensional covariance structure of observed variables into the CFA model. Additionally, we offer computationally efficient solutions (i.e., closed-form uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators) and ensure accurate statistical inference through closed-form exact variance estimators for all model parameters and factor scores. Through an extensive simulation analysis benchmarking against standard computational packages, SCFA exhibits superior performance in estimating model parameters and recovering factor scores, while substantially reducing the computational load, across both low- and high-dimensional scenarios. It exhibits moderate robustness to model misspecification.

These models are implemented using standard Bayesian statistical software and propagate the uncertainty associate with all model parameters including the change-point location. A simulation study was conducted to assess the predictive performance of these models compared with other parametric survival models. Change-point survival models were applied to three datasets, two of which were used in previous health technology assessments. Results: Change-point survival models typically provided improved extrapolated survival predictions, particularly when the changes in relative treatment effects are large. When applied to the real world examples they provided good fit to the observed data while and in some situations produced more clinically plausible extrapolations than those generated by flexible spline models. Change-point models also provided support to a previously implemented modelling approach which was justified by visual inspection only and not goodness of fit to the observed data.

Since exact Bayesian inference over the weights in a BNN is intractable, various approximate inference methods exist, among which sampling methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) are often considered the gold standard. While HMC provides high-quality samples, it lacks interpretable summary statistics because its sample mean and variance is meaningless in neural networks due to permutation symmetry. In this paper, we first show that the role of permutations can be meaningfully quantified by a number of transpositions metric. We then show that the recently proposed rebasin method allows us to summarize HMC samples into a compact representation that provides a meaningful explicit uncertainty estimate for each weight in a neural network, thus unifying sampling methods with variational inference. We show that this compact representation allows us to compare trained BNNs directly in weight space across sampling methods and variational inference, and to efficiently prune neural networks trained without explicit Bayesian frameworks by exploiting uncertainty estimates from HMC.", "authors": "Tim Z.

Bayesian hierarchical models offer a coherent probabilistic framework for evaluating associations between environmental exposures and health effects, which take into account exposure measurement errors introduced by uncertainty in the estimated exposure as well as spatial misalignment between the exposure and health outcome data. While two-stage Bayesian analyses are often regarded as a good alternative to fully Bayesian analyses when joint estimation is not feasible, there has been minimal research on how to properly propagate uncertainty from the first-stage exposure model to the second-stage health model, especially in the case of a large number of participant locations along with spatially correlated exposures. We propose a scalable two-stage Bayesian approach, called a sparse multivariate normal (sparse MVN) prior approach, based on the Vecchia approximation for assessing associations between exposure and health outcomes in environmental epidemiology. We compare its performance with existing approaches through simulation. Our sparse MVN prior approach shows comparable performance with the fully Bayesian approach, which is a gold standard but is impossible to implement in some cases.

Measurements from each sensor over time form a curve and can be viewed as functional data. Clustering of these multivariate functional curves is important for studying the operating patterns of systems. One complication in such applications is the possible presence of sensors whose data do not contain relevant information. Hence it is desirable for the clustering method to equip with an automatic sensor selection procedure. Motivated by a real engineering application, we propose a functional data clustering method that simultaneously removes noninformative sensors and groups functional curves into clusters using informative sensors. Functional principal component analysis is used to transform multivariate functional data into a coefficient matrix for data reduction. We then model the transformed data by a Gaussian mixture distribution to perform model-based clustering with variable selection. Three types of penalties, the individual, variable, and group penalties, are considered to achieve automatic variable selection.

We investigate the saturation of multi-dimensional plasma instabilities and its effects on energetic ion formation. Such ions directly impact spacecraft thruster lifetimes and are associated with magnetic reconnection and cosmic ray inception. An Eulerian Vlasov--Poisson solver employing the grid-based direct kinetic method is used to study the growth and saturation of 2D2V collisionless, electrostatic current-driven instabilities spanning two dimensions each in the configuration (D) and velocity (V) spaces supporting ion and electron phase-space transport. Four stages characterise the electric potential evolution in such instabilities: linear modal growth, harmonic growth, accelerated growth via quasi-linear mechanisms alongside non-linear fill-in, and saturated turbulence. Its transition and isotropisation process bears considerable similarities to the development of hydrodynamic turbulence. While a tendency to isotropy is observed in the plasma waves, followed by electron and then ion phase space after several ion-acoustic periods, the formation of energetic backstreaming ions is more limited in the 2D2V than in the 1D1V simulations. Plasma waves formed by two-dimensional electrostatic kinetic instabilities can propagate in the direction perpendicular to the net electron drift. Thus, large-amplitude multi-dimensional waves generate high-energy transverse-streaming ions and eventually limit energetic backward-streaming ions along the longitudinal direction.

{"title": "Simulation-based transition density approximation for the inference of SDE models", "abstract": "Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) serve as a powerful modeling tool in various scientific domains, including systems science, engineering, and ecological science. While the specific form of SDEs is typically known for a given problem, certain model parameters remain unknown. Efficiently inferring these unknown parameters based on observations of the state in discrete time series represents a vital practical subject. The challenge arises in nonlinear SDEs, where maximum likelihood estimation of parameters is generally unfeasible due to the absence of closed-form expressions for transition and stationary probability density functions of the states. In response to this limitation, we propose a novel two-step parameter inference mechanism. This approach involves a global-search phase followed by a local-refining procedure. The global-search phase is dedicated to identifying the domain of high-value likelihood functions, while the local-refining procedure is specifically designed to enhance the surrogate likelihood within this localized domain. Additionally, we present two simulation-based approximations for the transition density, aiming to efficiently or accurately approximate the likelihood function. Numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of our proposed methodology in achieving posterior parameter estimation.", "authors": "Xin Cai, Jingyu Yang, Zhibao Li, Hongqiao Wang", "date": " 29 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Modelling Species Distributions with Deep Learning to Predict Plant Extinction Risk and Assess Climate Change Impacts", "abstract": "The post-2020 global biodiversity framework needs ambitious, research-based targets. Estimating the accelerated extinction risk due to climate change is critical. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) measures the extinction risk of species. Automatic methods have been developed to provide information on the IUCN status of under-assessed taxa. However, these compensatory methods are based on current species characteristics, mainly geographical, which precludes their use in future projections. Here, we evaluate a novel method for classifying the IUCN status of species benefiting from the generalisation power of species distribution models based on deep learning. Our method matches state-of-the-art classification performance while relying on flexible SDM-based features that capture species' environmental preferences. Cross-validation yields average accuracies of 0.61 for status classification and 0.78 for binary classification. Climate change will reshape future species distributions. Under the species-environment equilibrium hypothesis, SDM projections approximate plausible future outcomes. Two extremes of species dispersal capacity are considered: unlimited or null. The projected species distributions are translated into features feeding our IUCN classification method. Finally, trends in threatened species are analysed over time and i) by continent and as a function of average ii) latitude or iii) altitude. The proportion of threatened species is increasing globally, with critical rates in Africa, Asia and South America. Furthermore, the proportion of threatened species is predicted to peak around the two Tropics, at the Equator, in the lowlands and at altitudes of 800-1,500 m.", "authors": "Joaquim Estopinan, Pierre Bonnet, Maximilien Servajean, François Munoz, Alexis Joly", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm to detect imprinting and maternal effects for discordant sib-pair data", "abstract": "Numerous statistical methods have been developed to explore genomic imprinting and maternal effects, which are causes of parent-of-origin patterns in complex human diseases. Most of the methods, however, either only model one of these two confounded epigenetic effects, or make strong yet unrealistic assumptions about the population to avoid over-parameterization. A recent partial likelihood method (LIMEDSP ) can identify both epigenetic effects based on discordant sibpair family data without those assumptions. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown its validity and robustness. As LIMEDSP method obtains parameter estimation by maximizing partial likelihood, it is interesting to compare its efficiency with full likelihood maximizer. To overcome the difficulty in over-parameterization when using full likelihood, this study proposes a discordant sib-pair design based Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEMDSP ) method to detect imprinting and maternal effects jointly. Those unknown mating type probabilities, the nuisance parameters, are considered as latent variables in EM algorithm. Monte Carlo samples are used to numerically approximate the expectation function that cannot be solved algebraically. Our simulation results show that though this MCEMDSP algorithm takes longer computation time, it can generally detect both epigenetic effects with higher power, which demonstrates that it can be a good complement of LIMEDSP method", "authors": "Ruwani Herath, Alex Trindade, Fangyuan Zhang", "date": " 31 Dec 2023"},

With the overarching objective to optimize and personalize disease management, biomarker-guided clinical trials increase the efficiency by appropriately utilizing prognostic or predictive biomarkers in the design. However, the efficiency gain is often not quantitatively compared to the traditional all-comers design, in which a faster enrollment rate is expected (e.g. due to no restriction to biomarker positive patients) potentially leading to a shorter duration. To accurately predict biomarker-guided trial duration, we propose a general framework using mixture distributions accounting for heterogeneous population. Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the impact of heterogeneous population and the dynamics of biomarker characteristics and disease on the study duration. Several influential parameters including median survival time, enrollment rate, biomarker prevalence and effect size are identitied. Re-assessments of two publicly available trials are conducted to empirically validate the prediction accuracy and to demonstrate the practical utility.

However, due to the infinite dimensional input, we need a powerful dimension reduction method for functional learning tasks, especially for the nonlinear functional regression. In this paper, based on the idea of smooth kernel integral transformation, we propose a functional deep neural network with an efficient and fully data-dependent dimension reduction method. The architecture of our functional net consists of a kernel embedding step: an integral transformation with a data-dependent smooth kernel; a projection step: a dimension reduction by projection with eigenfunction basis based on the embedding kernel; and finally an expressive deep ReLU neural network for the prediction. The utilization of smooth kernel embedding enables our functional net to be discretization invariant, efficient, and robust to noisy observations, capable of utilizing information in both input functions and responses data, and have a low requirement on the number of discrete points for an unimpaired generalization performance.

{"title": "Reliability Analysis of Complex Systems using Subset Simulations with Hamiltonian Neural Networks", "abstract": "We present a new Subset Simulation approach using Hamiltonian neural network-based Monte Carlo sampling for reliability analysis. The proposed strategy combines the superior sampling of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method with computationally efficient gradient evaluations using Hamiltonian neural networks. This combination is especially advantageous because the neural network architecture conserves the Hamiltonian, which defines the acceptance criteria of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. Hence, this strategy achieves high acceptance rates at low computational cost. Our approach estimates small failure probabilities using Subset Simulations. However, in low-probability sample regions, the gradient evaluation is particularly challenging. The remarkable accuracy of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on different reliability problems, and its efficiency is compared to the traditional Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We note that this approach can reach its limitations for gradient estimations in low-probability regions of complex and high-dimensional distributions. Thus, we propose techniques to improve gradient prediction in these particular situations and enable accurate estimations of the probability of failure. The highlight of this study is the reliability analysis of a system whose parameter distributions must be inferred with Bayesian inference problems. In such a case, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method requires a full model evaluation for each gradient evaluation and, therefore, comes at a very high cost. However, using Hamiltonian neural networks in this framework replaces the expensive model evaluation, resulting in tremendous improvements in computational efficiency.", "authors": "Denny Thaler, Somayajulu L.

It is competitive with recent frequentist methods, and more effective and informative, and is as easy to implement as it is to compute the posterior means and variances of the entity means.

However, selective publication of diagnostic studies for meta-analysis can induce publication bias (PB) on the estimate of the SROC curve. Several sensitivity analysis methods have been developed to quantify PB on the SROC curve, and all these methods utilize parametric selection functions to model the selective publication mechanism. The main contribution of this article is to propose a new sensitivity analysis approach that derives the worst-case bounds for the SROC curve by adopting nonparametric selection functions under minimal assumptions. The estimation procedures of the worst-case bounds use the Monte Carlo method to obtain the SROC curves along with the corresponding area under the curves in the worst case where the maximum possible PB under a range of marginal selection probabilities is considered. We apply the proposed method to a real-world meta-analysis to show that the worst-case bounds of the SROC curves can provide useful insights for discussing the robustness of meta-analytical findings on diagnostic test accuracy.", "authors": "Yi Zhou, Ao Huang, Satoshi Hattori", "date": " 10 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Physics-based vs. data-driven 24-hour probabilistic forecasts of precipitation for northern tropical Africa", "abstract": "Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models struggle to skillfully predict tropical precipitation occurrence and amount, calling for alternative approaches. For instance, it has been shown that fairly simple, purely data-driven logistic regression models for 24-hour precipitation occurrence outperform both climatological and NWP forecasts for the West African summer monsoon. More complex neural network based approaches, however, remain underdeveloped due to the non-Gaussian character of precipitation. In this study, we develop, apply and evaluate a novel two-stage approach, where we train a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) model on gridded rainfall data to obtain a deterministic forecast and then apply the recently developed, nonparametric Easy Uncertainty Quantification (EasyUQ) approach to convert it into a probabilistic forecast. We evaluate CNN+EasyUQ for one-day ahead 24-hour accumulated precipitation forecasts over northern tropical Africa for 2011--2019, with the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) data serving as ground truth. In the most comprehensive assessment to date we compare CNN+EasyUQ to state-of-the-art physics-based and data-driven approaches such as a monthly probabilistic climatology, raw and postprocessed ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and traditional statistical approaches that use up to 25 predictor variables from IMERG and the ERA5 reanalysis.Generally, statistical approaches perform about en par with post-processed ECMWF ensemble forecasts. The CNN+EasyUQ approach, however, clearly outperforms all competitors for both occurrence and amount. Hybrid methods that merge CNN+EasyUQ and physics-based forecasts show slight further improvement. Thus, the CNN+EasyUQ approach can likely improve operational probabilistic forecasts of rainfall in the tropics, and potentially even beyond.", "authors": "Eva-Maria Walz, Peter Knippertz, Andreas H.

{"title": "Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets", "abstract": "Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case.

We assume an additive structure for the mean of each mixture component and incorporate the effects of continuous covariates through smooth nonlinear functions. The key components of our modelling approach are penalised B-splines and their bivariate tensor product extension. Our proposed method also seamlessly accommodates parametric effects of categorical covariates, linear effects of continuous covariates, interactions between categorical and/or continuous covariates, varying coefficient terms, and random effects, which is why we refer our model as a Dirichlet process mixture of normal structured additive regression models.

This lack of transparency in RL models has been a long-standing problem, making it difficult for users to grasp the reasons behind an agent's behaviour. Various approaches have been explored to address this problem, with one promising avenue being reward decomposition (RD). RD is appealing as it sidesteps some of the concerns associated with other methods that attempt to rationalize an agent's behaviour in a post-hoc manner. RD works by exposing various facets of the rewards that contribute to the agent's objectives during training. However, RD alone has limitations as it primarily offers insights based on sub-rewards and does not delve into the intricate cause-and-effect relationships that occur within an RL agent's neural model. In this paper, we present an extension of RD that goes beyond sub-rewards to provide more informative explanations. Our approach is centred on a causal learning framework that leverages information-theoretic measures for explanation objectives that encourage three crucial properties of causal factors: \\emph{causal sufficiency}, \\emph{sparseness}, and \\emph{orthogonality}. These properties help us distill the cause-and-effect relationships between the agent's states and actions or rewards, allowing for a deeper understanding of its decision-making processes. Our framework is designed to generate local explanations and can be applied to a wide range of RL tasks with multiple reward channels. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our approach offers more meaningful and insightful explanations for the agent's action selections.", "authors": "Wenhao Lu, Xufeng Zhao, Thilo Fryen, Jae Hee Lee, Mengdi Li, Sven Magg, Stefan Wermter", "date": " 30 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Group lasso priors for Bayesian accelerated failure time models with left-truncated and interval-censored data", "abstract": "An important task in health research is to characterize time-to-event outcomes such as disease onset or mortality in terms of a potentially high-dimensional set of risk factors. For example, prospective cohort studies of Alzheimer's disease typically enroll older adults for observation over several decades to assess the long-term impact of genetic and other factors on cognitive decline and mortality. The accelerated failure time model is particularly well-suited to such studies, structuring covariate effects as `horizontal' changes to the survival quantiles that conceptually reflect shifts in the outcome distribution due to lifelong exposures. However, this modeling task is complicated by the enrollment of adults at differing ages, and intermittent followup visits leading to interval censored outcome information. Moreover, genetic and clinical risk factors are not only high-dimensional, but characterized by underlying grouping structure, such as by function or gene location. Such grouped high-dimensional covariates require shrinkage methods that directly acknowledge this structure to facilitate variable selection and estimation. In this paper, we address these considerations directly by proposing a Bayesian accelerated failure time model with a group-structured lasso penalty, designed for left-truncated and interval-censored time-to-event data. We develop a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for efficient estimation, and investigate the impact of various methods of penalty tuning and thresholding for variable selection. We present a simulation study examining the performance of this method relative to models with an ordinary lasso penalty, and apply the proposed method to identify groups of predictive genetic and clinical risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) prospective cohort studies of AD and dementia.", "authors": "Harrison T.

Staged trees are a type of probabilistic graphical model for finite sample space processes. They are a natural fit for longitudinal data because a temporal ordering is often implicitly assumed and standard methods can be used for model selection and probability estimation. However, model selection methods perform poorly when the sample size is small relative to the size of the graph and model interpretation is tricky with larger graphs. This is exacerbated by longitudinal data which is characterised by repeated observations. To address these issues we propose two approaches: the longitudinal staged tree with Markov assumptions which makes some initial conditional independence assumptions represented by a directed acyclic graph and marginal longitudinal staged trees which model certain margins of the data.", "authors": "Jack Storror Carter, Manuele Leonelli, Eva Riccomagno, Alessandro Ugolini", "date": " 9 Jan 2024"},

Yet, their application to time series data is very challenging due to temporal dependencies. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the statistical significance of correlation coefficients in time series data, addressing the limitations of traditional methods based on the concept of effective degrees of freedom (or effective sample size, ESS). These effective degrees of freedom represent the independent sample size that would yield comparable test statistics under the assumption of no temporal correlation. We propose to assume a parametric Gaussian form for the autocorrelation function. We show that this assumption, motivated by a Laplace approximation, enables a simple estimator of the ESS that depends only on the temporal derivatives of the time series. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed approach yields accurate statistics while significantly reducing computational overhead. In addition, we evaluate the adequacy of our approach on real physiological signals, for assessing the connectivity measures in electrophysiology and detecting correlated arm movements in motion capture data.

Cross-validation gives an unbiased estimate of the risk (for the present sample size n) with a given penalty parameter, and this function can be minimized as a function of the penalty parameter. Least-squares cross-validation, which has been proposed for the similar Deconvoluting Kernel Density Estimator (DKDE), performs quite poorly for SPeD. We instead estimate the risk function for a smaller sample size n_1 < n with a given penalty parameter, using this to choose the penalty parameter for sample size n_1, and then use the asymptotics of the optimal penalty parameter to choose for sample size n. In a simulation study, we find that this has dramatically better performance than cross-validation, is an improvement over a SURE-type method previously proposed for this estimator, and compares favorably to the classic DKDE with its recommended plug-in method.

{"title": "Inferring Heterogeneous Treatment Effects of Crashes on Highway Traffic: A Doubly Robust Causal Machine Learning Approach", "abstract": "Highway traffic crashes exert a considerable impact on both transportation systems and the economy. In this context, accurate and dependable emergency responses are crucial for effective traffic management. However, the influence of crashes on traffic status varies across diverse factors and may be biased due to selection bias. Therefore, there arises a necessity to accurately estimate the heterogeneous causal effects of crashes, thereby providing essential insights to facilitate individual-level emergency decision-making. This paper proposes a novel causal machine learning framework to estimate the causal effect of different types of crashes on highway speed. The Neyman-Rubin Causal Model (RCM) is employed to formulate this problem from a causal perspective. The Conditional Shapley Value Index (CSVI) is proposed based on causal graph theory to filter adverse variables, and the Structural Causal Model (SCM) is then adopted to define the statistical estimand for causal effects. The treatment effects are estimated by Doubly Robust Learning (DRL) methods, which combine doubly robust causal inference with classification and regression machine learning models. Experimental results from 4815 crashes on Highway Interstate 5 in Washington State reveal the heterogeneous treatment effects of crashes at varying distances and durations. The rear-end crashes cause more severe congestion and longer durations than other types of crashes, and the sideswipe crashes have the longest delayed impact. Additionally, the findings show that rear-end crashes affect traffic greater at night, while crash to objects has the most significant influence during peak hours. Statistical hypothesis tests, error metrics based on matched \"counterfactual outcomes\", and sensitive analyses are employed for assessment, and the results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.", "authors": "Shuang Li, Ziyuan Pu, Zhiyong Cui, Seunghyeon Lee, Xiucheng Guo, Dong Ngoduy", "date": " 1 Jan 2024"},

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel outlier detection method based on ensembles of Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures. The proposed method is a fully unsupervised algorithm that capitalizes on random subspace and subsampling ensembles, not only ensuring efficient computation but also enhancing the robustness of the resulting outlier detector. Moreover, the proposed method leverages variational inference for Dirichlet process mixtures to ensure efficient and fast computation.

{"title": "Efficient Sparse Least Absolute Deviation Regression with Differential Privacy", "abstract": "In recent years, privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms have attracted increasing attention because of their important applications in many scientific fields.

In this work, we aim to develop a fast privacy-preserving learning solution for a sparse robust regression problem. Our learning loss consists of a robust least absolute loss and an $\\ell_1$ sparse penalty term. To fast solve the non-smooth loss under a given privacy budget, we develop a Fast Robust And Privacy-Preserving Estimation (FRAPPE) algorithm for least absolute deviation regression.

{"title": "TripleSurv: Triplet Time-adaptive Coordinate Loss for Survival Analysis", "abstract": "A core challenge in survival analysis is to model the distribution of censored time-to-event data, where the event of interest may be a death, failure, or occurrence of a specific event. Previous studies have showed that ranking and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)loss functions are widely-used for survival analysis. However, ranking loss only focus on the ranking of survival time and does not consider potential effect of samples for exact survival time values. Furthermore, the MLE is unbounded and easily subject to outliers (e.g., censored data), which may cause poor performance of modeling. To handle the complexities of learning process and exploit valuable survival time values, we propose a time-adaptive coordinate loss function, TripleSurv, to achieve adaptive adjustments by introducing the differences in the survival time between sample pairs into the ranking, which can encourage the model to quantitatively rank relative risk of pairs, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of predictions. Most importantly, the TripleSurv is proficient in quantifying the relative risk between samples by ranking ordering of pairs, and consider the time interval as a trade-off to calibrate the robustness of model over sample distribution. Our TripleSurv is evaluated on three real-world survival datasets and a public synthetic dataset. The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and exhibits good model performance and robustness on modeling various sophisticated data distributions with different censor rates.

The presence of such irregularities underscores critical vacua in the literature. In response, this paper presents three sets of results: First, we show that the (R)SAA is effective even if the objective function is not necessarily Lipschitz and the underlying distribution admits some bounded central moments only at (near-)optimal solutions. Second, when the SP's objective function is the sum of a smooth term and a Lipschitz term, we prove that the (R)SAA's sample complexity is completely independent from any complexity measures (e.g., the covering number) of the feasible region. Third, we explicate the (R)SAA's sample complexities with regard to the dependence on dimensionality $d$: When some $p$th ($p\\geq 2$) central moment of the underlying distribution is bounded, we show that the required sample size grows at a rate no worse than $\\mathcal O\\left(p d^{2/p}\\right)$ under any one of the three structural assumptions: (i) strong convexity w.r.t. the $q$-norm ($q\\geq 1$); (ii) the combination of restricted strong convexity and sparsity; and (iii) a dimension-insensitive $q$-norm of an optimal solution. In both cases of (i) and (iii), it is further required that $p\\leq q/(q-1)$. As a direct implication, the (R)SAA's complexity becomes (poly-)logarithmic in $d$, whenever $p\\geq c\\cdot \\ln d$ is admissible for some constant $c>0$. These new results deviate from the SAA's typical sample complexities that grow polynomially with $d$.

We investigate the behavior of AD across different precision levels (16, 32, 64 bits) and convolutional architectures (LeNet, VGG, and ResNet) on various datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN, and ImageNet). Although AD can be incorrect, recent research has shown that it coincides with the derivative almost everywhere, even in the presence of nonsmooth operations (such as MaxPool and ReLU). On the other hand, in practice, AD operates with floating-point numbers  (not real numbers), and there is, therefore, a need to explore subsets on which AD can be numerically incorrect. These subsets include a bifurcation zone (where AD is incorrect over reals) and a compensation zone (where AD is incorrect over floating-point numbers but correct over reals). Using SGD for the training process, we study the impact of different choices of the nonsmooth Jacobian for the MaxPool function on the precision of 16 and 32 bits. These findings suggest that nonsmooth MaxPool Jacobians with lower norms help maintain stable and efficient test accuracy, whereas those with higher norms can result in instability and decreased performance. We also observe that the influence of MaxPool's nonsmooth Jacobians on learning can be reduced by using batch normalization, Adam-like optimizers, or increasing the precision level.", "authors": "Ryan Boustany", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that achieves its result in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\\log^2N)$. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search.

We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself. More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution.

Our framework adapts the principle of stochastic data centering to graph data through novel graph anchoring strategies, and is able to support partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic networks are necessary to obtain reliable estimates, we find that the functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\\Delta$UQ on pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate, concept and graph size shifts, we show that G-$\\Delta$UQ leads to better calibrated GNNs for node and graph classification. Further, it also improves performance on the uncertainty-based tasks of out-of-distribution detection and generalization gap estimation. Overall, our work provides insights into uncertainty estimation for GNNs, and demonstrates the utility of G-$\\Delta$UQ in obtaining reliable estimates.", "authors": "Puja Trivedi, Mark Heimann, Rushil Anirudh, Danai Koutra, Jayaraman J.

{"title": "Krylov Cubic Regularized Newton: A Subspace Second-Order Method with Dimension-Free Convergence Rate", "abstract": "Second-order optimization methods, such as cubic regularized Newton methods, are known for their rapid convergence rates; nevertheless, they become impractical in high-dimensional problems due to their substantial memory requirements and computational costs. One promising approach is to execute second-order updates within a lower-dimensional subspace, giving rise to subspace second-order methods. However, the majority of existing subspace second-order methods randomly select subspaces, consequently resulting in slower convergence rates depending on the problem's dimension $d$. In this paper, we introduce a novel subspace cubic regularized Newton method that achieves a dimension-independent global convergence rate of ${O}\\left(\\frac{1}{mk}+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\right)$ for solving convex optimization problems. Here, $m$ represents the subspace dimension, which can be significantly smaller than $d$. Instead of adopting a random subspace, our primary innovation involves performing the cubic regularized Newton update within the Krylov subspace associated with the Hessian and the gradient of the objective function. This result marks the first instance of a dimension-independent convergence rate for a subspace second-order method. Furthermore, when specific spectral conditions of the Hessian are met, our method recovers the convergence rate of a full-dimensional cubic regularized Newton method. Numerical experiments show our method converges faster than existing random subspace methods, especially for high-dimensional problems.", "authors": "Ruichen Jiang, Parameswaran Raman, Shoham Sabach, Aryan Mokhtari, Mingyi Hong, Volkan Cevher", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

These factors are crucial for entrepreneurs seeking donor support. However, the terrain of charity crowdfunding within the Social Web remains relatively unexplored, lacking comprehension of the motivations driving donations that often lack concrete reciprocation. Distinct from conventional crowdfunding that offers tangible returns, charity crowdfunding relies on intangible rewards like tax advantages, recognition posts, or advisory roles. Such details are often embedded within campaign narratives, yet, the analysis of textual content in charity crowdfunding is limited. This study introduces an inventive text analytics framework, utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract latent themes from textual descriptions of charity campaigns. The study has explored four different themes, two each in campaign and incentive descriptions. Campaign description themes are focused on child and elderly health mainly the ones who are diagnosed with terminal diseases. Incentive description themes are based on tax benefits, certificates, and appreciation posts. These themes, combined with numerical parameters, predict campaign success. The study was successful in using Random Forest Classifier to predict success of the campaign using both thematic and numerical parameters. The study distinguishes thematic categories, particularly medical need-based charity and general causes, based on project and incentive descriptions.

{"title": "Statistical Response of ENSO Complexity to Initial Value and Model Parameter Perturbations", "abstract": "Studying the response of a climate system to perturbations has practical significance. Standard methods in computing the trajectory-wise deviation caused by perturbations may suffer from the chaotic nature that makes the model error dominate the true response after a short lead time. Statistical response, which computes the return described by the statistics, provides a systematic way of reaching robust outcomes with an appropriate quantification of the uncertainty and extreme events. In this paper, information theory is applied to compute the statistical response and find the most sensitive perturbation direction of different El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events to initial value and model parameter perturbations. Depending on the initial phase and the time horizon, different state variables contribute to the most sensitive perturbation direction. While initial perturbations in sea surface temperature (SST) and thermocline depth usually lead to the most significant response of SST at short- and long-range, respectively, initial adjustment of the zonal advection can be crucial to trigger strong statistical responses at medium-range around 5 to 7 months, especially at the transient phases between El Niño and La Niña. It is also shown that the response in the variance triggered by external random forcing perturbations, such as the wind bursts, often dominates the mean response, making the resulting most sensitive direction very different from the trajectory-wise methods. Finally, despite the strong non-Gaussian climatology distributions, using Gaussian approximations in the information theory is efficient and accurate for computing the statistical response, allowing the method to be applied to sophisticated operational systems.", "authors": "Marios Andreou, Nan Chen", "date": " 6 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Complex systems approach to natural language", "abstract": "The review summarizes the main methodological concepts used in studying natural language from the perspective of complexity science and documents their applicability in identifying both universal and system-specific features of language in its written representation. Three main complexity-related research trends in quantitative linguistics are covered. The first part addresses the issue of word frequencies in texts and demonstrates that taking punctuation into consideration restores scaling whose violation in the Zipf's law is often observed for the most frequent words. The second part introduces methods inspired by time series analysis, used in studying various kinds of correlations in written texts. The related time series are generated on the basis of text partition into sentences or into phrases between consecutive punctuation marks. It turns out that these series develop features often found in signals generated by complex systems, like long-range correlations or (multi)fractal structures. Moreover, it appears that the distances between punctuation marks comply with the discrete variant of the Weibull distribution. In the third part, the application of the network formalism to natural language is reviewed, particularly in the context of the so-called word-adjacency networks. Parameters characterizing topology of such networks can be used for classification of texts, for example, from a stylometric perspective. Network approach can also be applied to represent the organization of word associations. Structure of word-association networks turns out to be significantly different from that observed in random networks, revealing genuine properties of language. Finally, punctuation seems to have a significant impact not only on the language's information-carrying ability but also on its key statistical properties, hence it is recommended to consider punctuation marks on a par with words.", "authors": "Tomasz Stanisz, Stanisław Drożdż, Jarosław Kwapień", "date": " 5 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Modular Learning of Deep Causal Generative Models for High-dimensional Causal Inference", "abstract": "Pearl's causal hierarchy establishes a clear separation between observational, interventional, and counterfactual questions. Researchers proposed sound and complete algorithms to compute identifiable causal queries at a given level of the hierarchy using the causal structure and data from the lower levels of the hierarchy. However, most of these algorithms assume that we can accurately estimate the probability distribution of the data, which is an impractical assumption for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the other hand, modern generative deep learning architectures can be trained to learn how to accurately sample from such high-dimensional distributions. Especially with the recent rise of foundation models for images, it is desirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer causal queries with such high-dimensional data. To address this, we propose a sequential training algorithm that, given the causal structure and a pre-trained conditional generative model, can train a deep causal generative model, which utilizes the pre-trained model and can provably sample from identifiable interventional and counterfactual distributions. Our algorithm, called Modular-DCM, uses adversarial training to learn the network weights, and to the best of our knowledge, is the first algorithm that can make use of pre-trained models and provably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent confounders with high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm using semi-synthetic and real-world datasets containing images as variables in the causal structure.", "authors": "Md Musfiqur Rahman, Murat Kocaoglu", "date": " 2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A survey on domain adaptation theory: learning bounds and theoretical guarantees", "abstract": "All famous machine learning algorithms that comprise both supervised and semi-supervised learning work well only under a common assumption: the training and test data follow the same distribution. When the distribution changes, most statistical models must be reconstructed from newly collected data, which for some applications can be costly or impossible to obtain. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop approaches that reduce the need and the effort to obtain new labeled samples by exploiting data that are available in related areas, and using these further across similar fields. This has given rise to a new machine learning framework known as transfer learning: a learning setting inspired by the capability of a human being to extrapolate knowledge across tasks to learn more efficiently. Despite a large amount of different transfer learning scenarios, the main objective of this survey is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art theoretical results in a specific, and arguably the most popular, sub-field of transfer learning, called domain adaptation. In this sub-field, the data distribution is assumed to change across the training and the test data, while the learning task remains the same.

Our contributions are threefold: First, we establish sharp bounds on the number of iterations required for power method to converge to the planted signal, for a broad range of the signal-to-noise ratios. Second, our analysis reveals that the actual algorithmic threshold for power iteration is smaller than the one conjectured in literature by a polylog(n) factor, where n is the ambient dimension.

Several research studies demonstrate the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, amyloid beta 1-42, T-tau, and P-tau, in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease stages. In this work, we used machine learning models to classify different stages of Alzheimer's disease based on the cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels alone. An electronic health record of patients from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database was analyzed and the patients were subdivided based on mini-mental state scores and clinical dementia ratings. Statistical and correlation analyses were performed to identify significant differences between the Alzheimer's stages. Afterward, machine learning classifiers including K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Boosted Tree, Ensemble Bagged Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classifiers were employed to classify the Alzheimer's disease stages. The results demonstrate that Ensemble Boosted Tree (84.4%) and Logistic Regression (73.4%) provide the highest accuracy for binary classification, while Ensemble Bagged Tree (75.4%) demonstrates better accuracy for multiclassification.

In this article, we consider a two-stage randomized (RAND2) p-value utilizing the uniformly most powerful (UMP) p-value in the first stage when multiple two-one-sided hypotheses are of interest. We investigate the behavior of the distribution functions of the two p-values when there are changes in the boundaries of the null or alternative hypothesis or when the chosen parameters are too close to these boundaries. We also consider the behavior of the power functions to an increase in sample size. Specifically, we investigate the level of conservativity to the sample sizes to see if we control the type I error rate when using either of the two p-values for any sample size. In multiple tests, we evaluate the performance of the two p-values in estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses.

{"title": "On the use of the M-quantiles for outlier detection in multivariate data", "abstract": "Defining a successful notion of a multivariate quantile has been an open problem for more than half a century, motivating a plethora of possible solutions. Of these, the approach of [8] and [25] leading to M-quantiles, is very appealing for its mathematical elegance combining elements of convex analysis and probability theory. The key idea is the description of a convex function (the K-function) whose gradient (the K-transform) is in one-to-one correspondence between all of R^d and the unit ball in R^d. By analogy with the d=1 case where the K-transform is a cumulative distribution function-like object (an M-distribution), the fact that its inverse is guaranteed to exist lends itself naturally to providing the basis for the definition of a quantile function for all d>=1. Over the past twenty years the resulting M-quantiles have seen applications in a variety of fields, primarily for the purpose of detecting outliers in multidimensional spaces. In this article we prove that for odd d>=3, it is not the gradient but a poly-Laplacian of the K-function that is (almost everywhere) proportional to the density function. For d even one cannot establish a differential equation connecting the K-function with the density. These results show that usage of the K-transform for outlier detection in higher odd-dimensions is in principle flawed, as the K-transform does not originate from inversion of a true M-distribution. We demonstrate these conclusions in two dimensions through examples from non-standard asymmetric distributions. Our examples illustrate a feature of the K-transform whereby regions in the domain with higher density map to larger volumes in the co-domain, thereby producing a magnification effect that moves inliers closer to the boundary of the co-domain than outliers. This feature obviously disrupts any outlier detection mechanism that relies on the inverse K-transform.", "authors": "Sajal Chakroborty, Ram Iyer, A. Alexandre Trindade", "date": " 3 Jan 2024 ("},

Notably, these maps typically feature high-probability outputs with simple patterns, whereas complex patterns are exponentially less probable. This bias has been extensively examined and attributed to principles derived from algorithmic information theory and algorithmic probability. In a significant advancement, it has been demonstrated that the renowned logistic map $x_{k+1}=\\mu x_k(1-x_k)$, and other one-dimensional maps exhibit simplicity bias when conceptualized as input-output systems. Building upon this foundational work, our research delves into the manifestations of simplicity bias within the random logistic map, specifically focusing on scenarios involving additive noise.

We propose a representation learning method that induces disentanglement by simultaneously learning the latent factors and the sparse causal graphical model that explains them. We develop a nonparametric identifiability theory that formalizes this principle and shows that the latent factors can be recovered by regularizing the learned causal graph to be sparse. More precisely, we show identifiablity up to a novel equivalence relation we call \"consistency\", which allows some latent factors to remain entangled (hence the term partial disentanglement). To describe the structure of this entanglement, we introduce the notions of entanglement graphs and graph preserving functions. We further provide a graphical criterion which guarantees complete disentanglement, that is identifiability up to permutations and element-wise transformations. We demonstrate the scope of the mechanism sparsity principle as well as the assumptions it relies on with several worked out examples. For instance, the framework shows how one can leverage multi-node interventions with unknown targets on the latent factors to disentangle them.

To address these limitations, we present a novel Multi-spatial Multi-temporal air quality forecasting method based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Gated Recurrent Units (M2G2), bridging the gap in air quality forecasting across spatial and temporal scales. The proposed framework consists of two modules: Multi-scale Spatial GCN (MS-GCN) for spatial information fusion and Multi-scale Temporal GRU(MT-GRU) for temporal information integration. In the spatial dimension, the MS-GCN module employs a bidirectional learnable structure and a residual structure, enabling comprehensive information exchange between individual monitoring stations and the city-scale graph. Regarding the temporal dimension, the MT-GRU module adaptively combines information from different temporal scales through parallel hidden states. Leveraging meteorological indicators and four air quality indicators, we present comprehensive comparative analyses and ablation experiments, showcasing the higher accuracy of M2G2 in comparison to nine currently available advanced approaches across all aspects.
