The molecular species is identified from clear absorption features corresponding to the 2_12-1_01 (rest frequency 494.034 GHz) and 1_11-0_00 (431.316 GHz) ground-state transitions of ortho and para forms of C2H3+, respectively, in ALMA spectra toward the southwestern image of PKS1830-211, where numerous molecules, including other hydrocarbons, have already been detected. From the simple assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with cosmic microwave background photons and an ortho-to-para ratio of three, we estimate a total C2H3+ column density of 2 x 10^12 cm^-2 and an abundance of 10^-10 compared to H_2. However, formation pumping could affect the population of metastable states, yielding a C2H3+ column density higher than the LTE value by a factor of a few. We explore possible routes to the formation of C2H3+, mainly connected to acetylene and methane, and find that the methane route is more likely in PDR environment. As one of the initial hydrocarbon building blocks, C2H3+ is thought to play an important role in astrochemistry, in particular in the formation of more complex organic molecules.", "authors": "S.

{"title": "Diurnal ejection of boulder clusters on comet 67P lasting beyond 3 AU", "abstract": "Ejection of large boulder-like debris is a vigorous form of cometary activity that is unlikely induced by water ice out-gassing alone but rather associated with the sublimation of super-volatile ices. Though perceived on several comets, actual pattern and mechanism of such activity are still unclear. Here we report on a specialized observation of ejections of decimeter- to meter-sized boulders on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko outbound between 2.5 and 3.3 AU from the Sun. With a common source region, these events recurred in local morning. The boulders of elongated shapes were ejected in clusters at low inclinations comparable to the solar elevation below 40 degrees at the time. We show that these chunks could be propelled by the surrounding, asymmetric gas field that produced a distinct lateral acceleration. Possibly both water and carbon dioxide have contributed to their mobilization, while the season and local topography are among deciding factors. The mechanisms for sustaining regular activity of comets at large heliocentric distances are likely more diverse and intricate than previously thought.", "authors": "Xian Shi, Xuanyu Hu, Jessica Agarwal, Carsten Güttler, Martin Rose, Horst Uwe Keller, Marco Fulle, Jakob Deller, Holger Sierks", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

This parameter is obtained from the combination of mid-infrared wavelength range transitions corresponding to consecutive ionisation stages in star-forming regions. We compiled observational data from a sample of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), including luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs), to study the softness parameter and its equivalent expression in two dimensions, the softness diagram. We compared them with predictions from photoionisation models to determine the shape of the ionising continuum energy distribution in each case. We also used the measured emission-line ratios as input for HCmistry-Teff-IR, a code that performs a Bayesian-like comparison with photoionisation model predictions in order to quantify the equivalent effective temperature (T*) and the ionisation parameter. We found similar average values within the errors of the softness parameter in (U)LIRGs (-0.57) in the rest of the SFGs (-0.51), which could be interpreted as indicative of a similar incident radiation field. This result is confirmed from the analysis using HCm-Teff-IR, which simultaneously points to a slightly lower, although similar within the errors, T* scale for (U)LIRGs, even when a higher dust-to-gas mass ratio is considered in the models for these objects. These derived T* values are compatible with the ionisation from massive stars, without any need of harder ionising sources, both for (U)LIRGs and the rest of the SFGs. However, the derived T* in (U)LIRGs do not show any correlation with metallicity. This could be interpreted as a sign that their similar average T* values are due to the attenuation of the energetic incident flux from massive stars by the heated dust mixed with the gas.", "authors": "Enrique Pérez-Montero, Juan A.

{"title": "Rotational excitation of interstellar benzonitrile by helium atoms", "abstract": "Interstellar aromatic molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic nitrogen and oxygen bearing molecules are thought to be abundant in the interstellar medium. In this class of molecules, benzonitrile ($c$-C$_6$H$_5$CN) plays an important role as a proxy for benzene. It has been detected through rotational emission in several astrophysical sources and is one of the simplest N-bearing polar aromatic molecules. Even in the cold ISM, the population of the rotational levels of benzonitrile might not be at equilibrium. Consequently, modeling its detected emission lines requires a prior computation of its quenching rate coefficients by the most abundant species in the ISM (He or H$_2$). In this paper, we focus on the excitation of c-C$_6$H$_5$CN by collision with He. We compute the first potential energy surface (PES) using the explicitly correlated coupled cluster method in conjunction with large basis sets. The PES obtained is characterized by a potential well depth of -97.2 cm$^{-1}$ and an important anisotropy. Scattering computations of the rotational (de-)excitation of c-C$_6$H$_5$CN by He atoms are performed by means of the coupled states approximation that allow to obtain collisional rates for rotational states up to $j$ = 9 and temperatures up to 40 K. These rate coefficients are then used to examine the effect of C$_6$H$_5$CN excitation induced by collisions with para-H$_2$ in molecular clouds by carrying out simple radiative transfer calculations of the excitation temperatures and show that non-equilibrium effects can be expected for H$_2$ densities up to 10$^5$-10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$.", "authors": "M.

{"title": "Quantum chaos in PT symmetric quantum systems", "abstract": "In this study, we explore the interplay between $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and quantum chaos in a non-Hermitian dynamical system. We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.", "authors": "Kshitij Sharma, Himanshu Sahu, Subroto Mukerjee", "date": "14 Jan 2024"},

(i) In the first model, a binary mass-imbalanced system is slightly perturbed by a stirring time-dependent elliptic external potential.

{"title": "Polymer patterning by laser-induced multi-point initiation of frontal polymerization", "abstract": "Frontal polymerization (FP) is an approach for thermosetting plastics at lower energy cost than an autoclave. The potential to generate simultaneous propagation of multiple polymerization fronts has been discussed as an exciting possibility. However, FP initiated at more than two points simultaneously has not been demonstrated. Multi-point initiation could enable both large scale material fabrication and unique pattern generation. Here the authors present laser-patterned photothermal heating as a method for simultaneous initiation of FP at multiple locations in a 2-D sample. Carbon black particles are mixed into liquid resin (dicyclopentadiene) to enhance absorption of light from a Ti:Sapphire laser (800 nm) focused on a sample. The laser is time-shared by rapid steering among initiation points, generating polymerization using up to seven simultaneous points of initiation. This process results in the formation of both symmetric and asymmetric seam patterns resulting from the collision of fronts. The authors also present and validate a theoretical framework for predicting the seam patterns formed by front collisions. This framework allows the design of novel patterns via an inverse solution for determining the initiation points required to form a desired pattern. Future applications of this approach could enable rapid, energy-efficient manufacturing of novel composite-like patterned materials.", "authors": "Andrés L. Cook, Mason A. Dearborn, Trevor M.

We study the orbital profiles and spectra of Cen X-3 during these spin-up/spin-down intervals, using long-term data monitored by Fermi/GBM, Swift/BAT and MAXI/GSC. In spin-up intervals, its orbital profile in 2-10 keV is symmetrically peaked around orbital phase 0.42, while in spin-down intervals of similar fluxes and similar magnitudes of spin change rate, its profile reaches a peak around orbital phase 0.22 and then declines gradually. Such a distinct orbital difference between spin-up and spin-down states of similar flux is hard to explain in the standard disk model and indicates that its torque reversals are related to processes on the orbital scale. The durations of continuous spin-up/spin-down trend (tens of days) also point to a superorbital variation. One possible scenario is the irradiation-driven warping disk instability, which may produce a flipped inner disk for tens of days.", "authors": "Zhenxuan Liao, Jiren Liu", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Equilibrium Multiplicity: A Systematic Approach using Homotopies, with an Application to Chicago", "abstract": "Discrete choice models with social interactions or spillovers may exhibit multiple equilibria. This paper provides a systematic approach to enumerating them for a quantitative spatial model with discrete locations, social interactions, and elastic housing supply. The approach relies on two homotopies. A homotopy is a smooth function that transforms the solutions of a simpler city where solutions are known, to a city with heterogeneous locations and finite supply elasticity. The first homotopy is that, in the set of cities with perfectly elastic floor surface supply, an economy with heterogeneous locations is homotopic to an economy with homogeneous locations, whose solutions can be comprehensively enumerated. Such an economy is epsilon close to an economy whose equilibria are the zeros of a system of polynomials. This is a well-studied area of mathematics where the enumeration of equilibria can be guaranteed. The second homotopy is that a city with perfectly elastic housing supply is homotopic to a city with an arbitrary supply elasticity. In a small number of cases, the path may bifurcate and a single path yields two or more equilibria. By running the method on thousands of cities, we obtain a large number of equilibria. Each equilibrium has different population distributions. We provide a method that is computationally feasible for economies with a large number of locations choices, with an empirical application to the City of Chicago. There exist multiple ``counterfactual Chicagos'' consistent with the estimated parameters. Population distribution, prices, and welfare are not uniquely pinned down by amenities.

{"title": "The Baade-Wesselink projection factor of RR Lyrae stars -- Calibration from OHP/SOPHIE spectroscopy and Gaia DR3 parallaxes", "abstract": "The application of the parallax of pulsation (PoP) technique to determine distances of pulsating stars implies the use of a scaling parameter, the projection factor (p-factor), required to transform disc-integrated radial velocities (RVs) into photospheric expansion velocities. The value of the p-factor is poorly known and debated. Most PoP applications assume a constant p-factor. However, it may actually depend on the physical parameters of each star. We aim to calibrate p-factors for RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) and compare them with classical Cepheids (CCs). Due to their higher surface gravity, RRLs have more compact atmospheres, and provide a valuable comparison with their supergiant siblings. We determined the p-factor of 17 RRLs using the SPIPS code, constrained by Gaia DR3 parallaxes, photometry, and new RVs from the OHP/SOPHIE spectrograph. We carefully examine the different steps of the PoP technique, particularly the method to determine RV from spectra using the classical cross-correlation function (CCF) approach. The method employed for RV extraction from the CCF has a strong impact on the p-factor, of up to 10%. However, this choice of method results in a global scaling of the p-factor, marginally affecting the scatter within the sample for a given method. Over our RRL sample, we find a mean value of $p = 1.248 \\pm 0.022$ for RVs derived using a Gaussian fit of the CCF. There is no evidence for a different value of the p-factor of RRLs, although its distribution for RRLs appears significantly less scattered than that for CCs. The p-factor does not appear to depend in a simple way on fundamental stellar parameters. We argue that large-amplitude dynamical phenomena occurring in the atmospheres of RRLs and CCs during their pulsation affect the relative velocity of the spectral line-forming regions compared to the velocity of the photosphere.", "authors": "Garance Bras, Pierre Kervella, Boris Trahin, Piotr Wielgórski, Bartłomiej Zgirski, Antoine Mérand, Nicolas Nardetto, Alexandre Gallenne, Vincent Hocdé, Louise Breuval, Anton Afanasiev, Grzegorz Pietrzyński, Wolfgang Gieren", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

The periodic variation of the NSH amplitude of TV Col confirms that periodic NSH amplitude changes in response to the tilted disk precession may be universal, which is another evidence that the origin of the NSHs is related to the tilted disk precession. We suggest that the NSH amplitude variation may be similar to the superorbital signal, coming from the periodic change in visual brightness of the energy released by streams touching the tilted disk with tilted disk precession. Finally, we find for the first time that the eclipse depth exhibits bi-periodic variations with periods of P1 = 3.905(11) d and P2 = 1.953(4) d, respectively. P2 is about half of P1 and the disk precession period (P1~Pprec~2*P2). We suggest that P1 may come from the periodic change in the brightness of the eclipse center due to tilted disk precession, while P2 may come from two accretion curtains precession together with the tilted disk.

{"title": "Kondo Phase in Twisted Bilayer Graphene -- A Unified Theory for Distinct Experiments", "abstract": "A number of interesting physical phenomena have been discovered in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), such as superconductivity, correlated gapped and gapless phases, etc. The gapped phases are believed to be symmetry-breaking states described by mean-field theories, whereas gapless phases exhibit features beyond mean field. This work, combining poor man's scaling, numerical renormalization group, and dynamic mean-field theory, demonstrates that the gapless phases are the heavy Fermi liquid state with some symmetries broken and the others preserved. We adopt the recently proposed topological heavy fermion model for MATBG with effective local orbitals around AA-stacking regions and Dirac fermions surrounding them. At zero temperature and most non-integer fillings, the ground states are found to be heavy Fermi liquids and exhibit Kondo resonance peaks. The Kondo temperature $T_K$ is found at the order of 1meV. A higher temperature than $T_K$ will drive the system into a metallic LM phase where disordered LM's and a Fermi liquid coexist. At integer fillings $\\pm1,\\pm2$, $T_K$ is suppressed to zero or a value weaker than RKKY interaction, leading to Mott insulators or symmetry-breaking states. This theory offers a unified explanation for several experimental observations, such as zero-energy peaks and quantum-dot-like behaviors in STM, the Pomeranchuk effect, and the saw-tooth feature of inverse compressibility, etc. For future experimental verification, we predict that the Fermi surface in the gapless phase will shrink upon heating - as a characteristic of the heavy Fermi liquid. We also conjecture that the heavy Fermi liquid is the parent state of the observed unconventional superconductivity because the Kondo screening reduces the overwhelming Coulomb interaction (~60meV) to a rather small effective interaction (~1meV) comparable to possible weak attractive interactions.", "authors": "Geng-Dong Zhou, Yi-Jie Wang, Ninghua Tong, Zhi-Da Song", "date": "11 Jan 2023 ("},

However, in-vitro studies capable of quantifying these interactions have remained elusive. Here, we investigate a synthetic system where a DNA reaction-diffusion (RD) front is advected by a turbulent flow generated by active matter (AM) flows in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Whereas the dynamics of simple RD fronts solely depend on the reaction and diffusion rates, we show that RD-AM front propagation is also influenced by the confinement geometry. We first experimentally dissected the different components of the reaction-diffusion-advection process by knocking out reaction or advection and observed how RD-AM allows for faster transport over large distances, avoiding dilution. We then show how confinement impacts active matter flow: while changes in instantaneous flow velocities are small; correlation times are dramatically increased with decreasing confinement. As a result, RD-AM front speed increased 3 to 9-fold compared to a RD one. This RD-AM experimental model provides a framework for the rational engineering of complex spatiotemporal processes observed in living systems. It will reinforce our understanding of how macro-scale patterns and structures emerge from microscopic components in non-equilibrium systems.", "authors": "Nicolas Lobato-Dauzier, Ananyo Maitra, André Estevez-Torres, Jean-Christophe Galas", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},

Using the Carreau model to describe the shear-dependent viscosity, we identify the key dimensionless rheological number, $Cu$, which characterizes shear thinning, and we show that our experiments lie within the power-law regime of shear rates. To rationalize the experimental data, we derive the flow rate--pressure drop relation taking into account the two-way-coupled fluid--structure interaction between the flow and its compliant confining boundaries.

We then compare the theoretical flow rate--pressure drop relation to our experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement between the two. We further contrast our results for shear-thinning and Newtonian fluids to highlight the influence of $Cu$ on the flow rate--pressure drop relation.

While the self-assembly kinetics in these systems have been elucidated and related to the product characteristics, the weak interparticle bonding interactions suggest the superstructures formed could continue to order within the solution long after the primary nucleation and growth have occurred, even though the mechanism of annealing remains to be elucidated. Here, we use a combination of Bragg coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to create real-space maps of supercrystalline order along with a real-time view of the strain fluctuations in aging strongly coupled nanocrystal superlattices while they remain suspended and immobilized in solution. By combining the results, we deduce that the self-assembled superstructures are polycrystalline, initially comprising multiple nucleation sites, and that shear avalanches at grain boundaries continue to increase crystallinity long after growth has substantially slowed. This multimodal approach should be generalizable to characterize a breadth of materials in situ in their native chemical environments, thus extending the reach of high-resolution coherent X-ray characterization to the benefit of a much wider range of physical systems.", "authors": "Matthew J.

{"title": "Self-supporting Structure of Bird Nests", "abstract": "The mystery behind the bird nest's construction is not well understood. Our study focuses on the stability of a self-supporting nest-like structure. Firstly, we derived a stable/unstable phase boundary for the structure at the fixed coefficient of friction with varying geometrical parameters through force analysis. Structures with a lower height and greater friction coefficient between rods are more stable. The theoretical phase boundary matched the experiment results well. Then we investigate the nest structure's stability under applied weight. Static structures with lower height and more rods (five>four>three) are more stable. Our theory also predicts a transition from plastic phase to elastic phase. These theoretical predictions are all confirmed by experiment. In the experiment, we also find that wet rod structures are more stable than dry ones. The structures can support up to 100 times of it's weight. Finally, we test the nest structure's stability under vibration. When there are no weights applied, we are able to identify the appropriate geometric configuration that can withstand the greatest vibration ($1g$ of vibration acceleration and vibration energy up to $4\\times10^{-4}$ times of a rod's maximum potential energy). The critical vibration energy and acceleration depend on the applied weights. They are increased by two and one order of magnitude respectively under proper weight.

Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them", "abstract": "Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively look for a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this letter, we consider a collective search cost that not only accounts for the search time but also for the cost associated to the creation and the maintenance of an agent. We first present a general formalism for independent agents in terms of the survival probability of the target for a single-agent search s(t), where we allow agents to be introduced in the system one after the other. From this, we first derive analytically the optimal number of searchers to launch initially in the system. Then, we identify the optimal strategies for exponential and algebraic single-agent survival probabilities by pointing out the ideal times at which new searchers should be launched in the system. Our results show that all searchers should be launched simultaneously in the exponential case, while some should be launched at later times in the algebraic case. Finally, we compare these results with numerical simulations of a strongly interacting collective search, the true self-avoiding walk, and show how the optimal strategy differ from the non-interacting case.", "authors": "Hugues Meyer, Heiko Rieger", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

We also explain how to deal with the physical timescales at stake at the mesoscale. Simulating the so-obtained mesoscale system enables us to equilibrate the long wavelengths of the vesicles of interest, up to the vesicle size. Conversely, we then backmap from the meso- to the nano- scale, which enables us to equilibrate in turn the short wavelengths down to the molecular length-scales. By applying our approach to the specific situation of the patterning of a vesicle membrane, we show that macroscopic membranes can thus be equilibrated at all length-scales in achievable computational time offering an original strategy to address the fundamental challenge of time scale in simulations of large bio-membrane systems.", "authors": "Julie Cornet, Nelly Coulonges, Weria Pezeshkian, Maël Penissat-Mahaut, Siewert-Jan Marrink, Nicolas Destainville, Matthieu Chavent, Manoel Manghi", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

The lower driving force arises from the vicinity of a spinodal instability in the solid and from a strain energy.

In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that holistically addresses these hurdles. Given a Boolean composition of multiple state constraints that define the safe set, our approach starts with building a single continuously differentiable function whose 0-superlevel set provides an inner approximation of the safe set. We then use this function together with a smooth neural network to parameterize the CBF candidate. Finally, we design a training loss function based on a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation to train the CBF while enlarging the volume of the induced control invariant set.

PCF combines conventional compress-and-forward (CF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols, enabling one relay to operate alternately in the CF or the AF mode, while the other relay works purely in the CF mode. As the direct link from the source to the destination is unavailable, and there is no noiseless relay in the diamond network, messages received from both relays must act as side information for each other and must be decoded jointly. We propose a joint decoder to decode two Luby transform (LT) codes received from both relays corresponding to the same original message.

The resiliency level of this networked control system (NCS) to the failures of physical devices or unreliability of communication channels is analyzed by introducing a linear auxiliary trajectory of the system. More precisely, the unreliability of communication channels sometimes makes an agent incapable of sensing the local information or receiving it from neighboring nodes. Therefore, an intermittent communication scheme is proposed among the follower agents as a consequence of employing the linear auxiliary dynamics. The closed-loop networked system signals are proved to be noise-to-state practically stable in probability (NSpS-P). It has been justified that each agent follows the trajectory of the corresponding local auxiliary virtual system practically in probability.

However, the bulky hardware in the phased array restricts its potential for enhancing detection accuracy, since the cost and power of the phased array can become unaffordable as its physical aperture scales up to pursue higher beam shaping capabilities. To resolve this issue, we propose a radar system enabled by reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs), a novel meta-surface antenna composed of meta-material elements with cost-effective and power-efficient hardware, which performs multi-target detection in an adaptive manner. Different from the phase-control structure in the phased array, the RHS is able to apply beamforming by controlling the radiation amplitudes of its elements. Consequently, traditional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays cannot be directly applied to RHSs due to this structural difference. To tackle this challenge, a waveform and amplitude optimization algorithm (WAOA) is designed to jointly optimize the radar waveform and RHS amplitudes in order to improve the detection accuracy. Simulation results reveal that the proposed RHS-enabled radar increases the probability of detection by 0.13 compared to phased array radars when six iterations of adaptive detection are performed given the same hardware cost.", "authors": "Xiaoyu Zhang, Haobo Zhang, Ruoqi Deng, Liang Liu, Boya Di", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

In this paper, we propose to use the defocused camera to measure vital signs from optically blurred images, which can fundamentally eliminate the privacy invasion as face is difficult to be identified in obtained blurry images. A spatial-redundant framework involving living-skin detection is used to extract HR and RR from the defocused camera in NIR, and a motion metric is designed to exclude outliers caused by body motions. In the benchmark, the overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for HR measurement is 4.4 bpm, for RR measurement is 5.9 bpm. Both have quality drops as compared to the measurement using a focused camera, but the degradation in HR is much less, i.e. HR measurement has strong correlation with the reference ($R \\geq 0.90$). Preliminary experiments suggest that it is feasible to use a defocused camera for cardio-respiratory monitoring while protecting the privacy.

Specifically, a legitimate IRS is introduced to reduce the strength of the DIRS-based jamming relative to the transmit signals at a legitimate user (LU). In addition, the active beamforming at the legitimate access point (AP) is designed to maximize the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratios (SJNRs). Numerical results are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed IRS-enhanced anti-jamming precoder against DIRS-based FPJs.", "authors": "Huan Huang, Hongliang Zhang, Yi Cai, Yunjing Zhang, A.

Various distributed deployment schemes of the GAI model are proposed to alleviate the immense network load and long user queuing times for accessing GAI models. Two MEG frameworks are proposed, namely the single-ES framework and the multi-ESs framework. 1) A one-to-one joint generation framework between an ES and a UE is proposed, including four specific single-ES MEG protocols. These protocols allow distributed GAI models to transmit seeds or sketches for delivering information efficiently. 2) Several protocols are proposed for multi-ESs MEG, which enable multiple ESs to perform the generation task cooperatively or in parallel. Finally, a case study of a text-guided-image-to-image generation is provided, where a latent diffusion model is distributed at an ES and a UE. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocols are able to generate high-quality images at extremely low signal-to-noise ratios.

Certain methodologies employ sparse Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) on the human body and harness data-driven strategies to model human poses. However, the reconstruction of motion based solely on sparse IMUs data is inherently fraught with ambiguity, a consequence of numerous identical IMU readings corresponding to different poses. In this paper, we explore the spatial importance of multiple sensors, supervised by text that describes specific actions. Specifically, uncertainty is introduced to derive weighted features for each IMU. We also design a Hierarchical Temporal Transformer (HTT) and apply contrastive learning to achieve precise temporal and feature alignment of sensor data with textual semantics. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed approach achieves significant improvements in multiple metrics compared to existing methods.

We consider RUs equipped with multiple antennas, and focus on the regime where the UE, RU, and DU densities are constant and therefore the number of such nodes grows with the coverage area. A system is said scalable if the computing load and information rate at any node in the network converges to a constant as the network size (coverage area) grows to infinity. This imposes that each UE must be processed by a (user-centric) finite-size cluster of RUs, and that such cluster processors are dynamically allocated to the DUs (e.g., as software defined virtual network functions) in order to achieve a balanced computation load. We also assume that the RUs are connected to the DUs through a packet switching network, in order to achieve adaptive routing and load balance. For this model, we define in details the dynamic cluster formation and uplink pilot allocation. As a consequence of the pilot allocation and the scalability constraint, each cluster processor has a partial view of the network channel state information. We define the condition of ``ideal partial CSI'' when the channel vectors that can be estimated are perfectly known (while the ones that cannot be estimated are not know at all). We develop two attractive cluster-based linear receiver schemes for the uplink, and an uplink-downlink duality that allows to reuse such vectors as precoders for the downlink.", "authors": "Fabian Göttsch, Giuseppe Caire, Wen Xu, Martin Schubert", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},

Body-area capacitive sensing, also called body-area electric field sensing, is becoming a promising alternative for wearable devices to accomplish certain tasks in human activity recognition and human-computer interaction. Over the last decade, researchers have explored plentiful novel sensing systems backed by the body-area electric field. On the other hand, despite the pervasive exploration of the body-area electric field, a comprehensive survey does not exist for an enlightening guideline. Moreover, the various hardware implementations, applied algorithms, and targeted applications result in a challenging task to achieve a systematic overview of the subject. This paper aims to fill in the gap by comprehensively summarizing the existing works on body-area capacitive sensing so that researchers can have a better view of the current exploration status. To this end, we first sorted the explorations into three domains according to the involved body forms: body-part electric field, whole-body electric field, and body-to-body electric field, and enumerated the state-of-art works in the domains with a detailed survey of the backed sensing tricks and targeted applications.

Nevertheless, existing research on SAC has predominantly confined its focus to scenarios characterized by minimal clutter and obstructions, largely neglecting indoor environments, particularly those in industrial settings, where propagation channels involve high clutter density. To address this research gap, background subtraction is proposed on the monostatic sensing echoes, which effectively addresses clutter removal and facilitates detection and tracking of user equipments (UEs) in cluttered indoor environments with SAC. A realistic evaluation of the introduced SAC strategy is provided, using ray tracing (RT) data with the scenario layout following Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) indoor factory (InF) channel models.

These RR estimation methods were mostly designed for finger-based PPG collected from subjects in stationary situations (e.g., in hospitals). In contrast to finger-based PPG signals, wrist-based PPG are more susceptible to noise, particularly in their low frequency range, which includes respiratory information. Therefore, the existing methods struggle to accurately extract RR when PPG data are collected from wrist area under free-living conditions. The increasing popularity of smartwatches, equipped with various sensors including PPG, has prompted the need for a robust RR estimation method. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach to extract RR from PPG, accelerometer, and gyroscope signals captured via smartwatches. Our method, including a dilated residual inception module and 1D convolutions, extract the temporal information from the signals, enabling RR estimation. Our method is trained and tested using data collected from 36 subjects under free-living conditions for one day using Samsung Gear Sport watches.

Since these datasets are obtained from measurements, they are limited in the variety of the charge/discharge profiles. To address this scarcity issue, we propose generating datasets by simulating a traditional battery model (e.g., a circuit-equivalent one). The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to use a simulatable battery model to evaluate a potentially infinite number of workload profiles for training the data-driven model. Furthermore, this general concept can be applied using any simulatable battery model, providing a fine spectrum of accuracy/complexity tradeoffs.

The maximization problem turns out to be NP-hard, so first, an alternating optimization (AO) is solved for the ${\\mathtt {U}^{net}}$ using low computational complexity heuristic BF approaches, namely, transmit minimum-mean-square-error and zero-forcing BF, and phase optimization is performed using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach. To combat the computational complexity of AO, we also propose an alternative solution by exploiting heuristic BF schemes and an iterative algorithm, i.e., the element-wise block-coordinate descent method for phase shifts optimization. Next, EE maximization is solved for the ${\\mathtt {I}^{net}}$ by optimizing the PS ratio and active BF vectors by exploiting optimal phase shifts of the ${\\mathtt {U}}^{net}$.

In our approach, first, we pre-process the CIR data which involves meticulous aggregation of measurements and extraction of key statistics. Afterwards, we leverage a convolutional deep neural network to map the CIRs into precise location estimates with sub-30 cm accuracy. Similarly, we achieve accurate human activity recognition and occupancy counting results.

But the severe errors of inertial sensors restrain their function, especially the trajectory recovery and semantic recognition. As a mainstream signal processing method, wavelet is hailed as the mathematical microscope of signal due to the plentiful and diverse wavelet basis functions. However, complicated noise types and application scenarios of inertial sensors make selecting wavelet basis perplexing. To this end, we propose a wavelet dynamic selection network (WDSNet), which intelligently selects the appropriate wavelet basis for variable inertial signals. In addition, existing deep learning architectures excel at extracting features from input data but neglect to learn the characteristics of target categories, which is essential to enhance the category awareness capability, thereby improving the selection of wavelet basis. Therefore, we propose a category representation mechanism (CRM), which enables the network to extract and represent category features without increasing trainable parameters. Furthermore, CRM transforms the common fully connected network into category representations, which provide closer supervision to the feature extractor than the far and trivial one-hot classification labels. We call this process of imposing interpretability on a network and using it to supervise the feature extractor the feature supervision mechanism, and its effectiveness is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically in this paper. The enhanced inertial signal can perform impracticable tasks with regard to the original signal, such as trajectory reconstruction.

Fortunately, up to 70 percent of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free if properly diagnosed and treated, and a reliable technique to monitor the onset of seizures could improve the quality of life of patients who are constantly facing the fear of random seizure attacks. The scalp-based EEG test, despite being the gold standard for diagnosing epilepsy, is costly, necessitates hospitalization, demands skilled professionals for operation, and is discomforting for users. In this paper, we propose EarSD, a novel lightweight, unobtrusive, and socially acceptable ear-worn system to detect epileptic seizure onsets by measuring the physiological signals from behind the user's ears. EarSD includes an integrated custom-built sensing, computing, and communication PCB to collect and amplify the signals of interest, remove the noises caused by motion artifacts and environmental impacts, and stream the data wirelessly to the computer or mobile phone nearby, where data are uploaded to the host computer for further processing. We conducted both in-lab and in-hospital experiments with epileptic seizure patients who were hospitalized for seizure studies. The preliminary results confirm that EarSD can detect seizures with up to 95.3 percent accuracy by just using classical machine learning algorithms.", "authors": "Abdul Aziz, Nhat Pham, Neel Vora, Cody Reynolds, Jaime Lehnen, Pooja Venkatesh, Zhuoran Yao, Jay Harvey, Tam Vu, Kan Ding, Phuc Nguyen", "date": "1 Jan 2024"},

While employing numerous sensors with high-frequency sampling rates usually improves the results, it often leads to data inefficiency and unnecessary expansion of the ANN, posing a challenge for their practical deployment on edge devices. Addressing these issues, our work introduces a pragmatic framework for data-efficient utilization in HAR tasks, considering the optimization of both sensor modalities and sampling rate simultaneously. Central to our approach are the designed trainable parameters, termed 'Weight Scores,' which assess the significance of each sensor modality and sampling rate during the training phase. These scores guide the sensor modalities and sampling rate selection. The pruning method allows users to make a trade-off between computational budgets and performance by selecting the sensor modalities and sampling rates according to the weight score ranking. We tested our framework's effectiveness in optimizing sensor modality and sampling rate selection using three public HAR benchmark datasets. The results show that the sensor and sampling rate combination selected via CoSS achieves similar classification performance to configurations using the highest sampling rate with all sensors but at a reduced hardware cost.", "authors": "Mengxi Liu, Zimin Zhao, Daniel Geißler, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

Given the powerful capabilities of deep neural networks in learning quantization codebooks, utilizing these networks in compressing the channels and reducing the massive MIMO CSI feedback overhead has recently gained increased interest. Learning one model, however, for the full cell or sector may not be optimal as the channel distribution could change significantly from one \\textit{zone} (an area or region) to another. In this letter, we introduce the concept of \\textit{zone-specific} CSI feedback. By partitioning the site space into multiple channel zones, the underlying channel distribution can be efficiently leveraged to reduce the CSI feedback. This concept leverages the implicit or explicit user position information to select the right zone-specific model and its parameters. To facilitate the evaluation of associated overhead, we introduce two novel metrics named \\textit{model parameters transmission rate} (MPTR) and \\textit{model parameters update rate} (MPUR). They jointly provide important insights and guidance for the system design and deployment. Simulation results show that significant gains could be achieved by the proposed framework.

Prior work has primarily focused on the codebook learning problem within a single cell/network and under stationary interference. In this work, we generalize the interference-aware codebook learning problem to networks with multiple cells/basestations. One of the key differences compared to the single-cell codebook learning problem is that the underlying environment becomes non-stationary, as the behavior of one base station will influence the learning of the others. Moreover, to encompass some of the challenging scenarios, information exchange between the different learning nodes is not allowed, which leads to a fully decentralized system with significantly increased learning difficulties. To tackle the non-stationarity, the averaging of the measurements is used to estimate the interference nulling performance of a particular beam, based on which a decision rule is provided. Furthermore, we theoretically justify the adoption of such estimator and prove that it is a sufficient statistic for the underlying quantity of interest in an asymptotic sense.

{"title": "Multivariate Extreme Value Theory Based Channel Modeling for Ultra-Reliable Communications", "abstract": "Attaining ultra-reliable communication (URC) in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks requires deriving statistics of channel in ultra-reliable region by modeling the extreme events. Extreme value theory (EVT) has been previously adopted in channel modeling to characterize the lower tail of received powers in URC systems. In this paper, we propose a multivariate EVT (MEVT)-based channel modeling methodology for tail of the joint distribution of multi-channel by characterizing the multivariate extremes of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The proposed approach derives lower tail statistics of received power of each channel by using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Then, tail of the joint distribution is modeled as a function of estimated GPD parameters based on two approaches: logistic distribution, which utilizes logistic distribution to determine dependency factors among the Frechet transformed tail sequence and obtain a bi-variate extreme value model, and Poisson point process, which estimates probability measure function of the Pickands angular component to model bi-variate extreme values. Finally, validity of the proposed models is assessed by incorporating the mean constraint on probability measure function of Pichanks coordinates. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the superiority of proposed methodology compared to the conventional extrapolation-based methods in providing the best fit to the multivariate extremes.", "authors": "Niloofar Mehrnia, Sinem Coleri", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Matrix Completion with Hypergraphs:Sharp Thresholds and Efficient Algorithms", "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of completing a rating matrix based on sub-sampled matrix entries as well as observed social graphs and hypergraphs. We show that there exists a \\emph{sharp threshold} on the sample probability for the task of exactly completing the rating matrix -- the task is achievable when the sample probability is above the threshold, and is impossible otherwise -- demonstrating a phase transition phenomenon. The threshold can be expressed as a function of the ``quality'' of hypergraphs, enabling us to \\emph{quantify} the amount of reduction in sample probability due to the exploitation of hypergraphs. This also highlights the usefulness of hypergraphs in the matrix completion problem. En route to discovering the sharp threshold, we develop a computationally efficient matrix completion algorithm that effectively exploits the observed graphs and hypergraphs. Theoretical analyses show that our algorithm succeeds with high probability as long as the sample probability exceeds the aforementioned threshold, and this theoretical result is further validated by synthetic experiments. Moreover, our experiments on a real social network dataset (with both graphs and hypergraphs) show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms.", "authors": "Zhongtian Ma, Qiaosheng Zhang, Zhen Wang", "date": "16 Jan 2024 ("},

To improve neural wearable usability, scalability, and enable discreet use in daily and itinerant environments, this work showcases the end-to-end design of the first wireless, in-ear, dry-electrode drowsiness monitoring platform. The proposed platform integrates additive manufacturing processes for gold-plated dry electrodes, user-generic earpiece designs, wireless electronics, and low-complexity machine learning algorithms. To evaluate the platform, thirty-five hours of ExG data were recorded across nine subjects performing repetitive drowsiness-inducing tasks. The data was used to train three, offline classifier models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) and evaluated with three training regimes (user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out). The support vector machine classifier achieved an average accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate for the first time that dry, 3D printed, user-generic electrodes can be used with wireless electronics to rapidly prototype wearable systems and achieve comparable average accuracy (>90%) to existing state-of-the-art in-ear and scalp ExG systems that utilize wet electrodes and wired, benchtop electronics.

The parameter $k$ represents the number of neighbors that are connected to the target node; however, its appropriate selection is still a challenging problem. Therefore, most $k$NNGs use ad hoc selection methods for $k$. In the proposed method, we assume that a different $k$ can be chosen for each node. We formulate a discrete optimization problem to seek the best $k$ with a constraint on the sum of distances of the connected nodes. The optimal $k$ values are efficiently obtained without solving a complex optimization. Furthermore, we reveal that the proposed method is closely related to existing graph learning methods. In experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that the $k$NNGs obtained with our method are sparse and can determine an appropriate variable number of edges per node. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for point cloud denoising, comparing our denoising performance with achievable graph construction methods that can be scaled to typical point cloud sizes (e.g., thousands of nodes).", "authors": "Asuka Tamaru, Junya Hara, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka, Antonio Ortega", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Eating Speed Measurement Using Wrist-Worn IMU Sensors in Free-Living Environments", "abstract": "Eating speed is an important indicator that has been widely scrutinized in nutritional studies. The relationship between eating speed and several intake-related problems such as obesity, diabetes, and oral health has received increased attention from researchers. However, existing studies mainly use self-reported questionnaires to obtain participants' eating speed, where they choose options from slow, medium, and fast. Such a non-quantitative method is highly subjective and coarse in individual level. In this study, we propose a novel approach to measure eating speed in free-living environments automatically and objectively using wrist-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. Specifically, a temporal convolutional network combined with a multi-head attention module (TCN-MHA) is developed to detect bites (including eating and drinking gestures) from free-living IMU data. The predicted bite sequences are then clustered to eating episodes. Eating speed is calculated by using the time taken to finish the eating episode to divide the number of bites. To validate the proposed approach on eating speed measurement, a 7-fold cross validation is applied to the self-collected fine-annotated full-day-I (FD-I) dataset, and a hold-out experiment is conducted on the full-day-II (FD-II) dataset. The two datasets are collected from 61 participants in free-living environments with a total duration of 513 h, which are publicly available. Experimental results shows that the proposed approach achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.110 and 0.146 in the FD-I and FD-II datasets, respectively, showcasing the feasibility of automated eating speed measurement.

Due to the NP-hard nature of sparse recovery, existing methods are known to suffer either from restrictive (or even unknown) applicability conditions, or high computational cost. Recently, iterative regularization methods have emerged as a promising fast approach because they can achieve sparse recovery in one pass through early stopping, rather than the tedious grid-search used in the traditional methods. However, most of those iterative methods are based on the $\\ell_1$ norm which requires restrictive applicability conditions and could fail in many cases. Therefore, achieving sparse recovery with iterative regularization methods under a wider range of conditions has yet to be further explored. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative regularization algorithm, IRKSN, based on the $k$-support norm regularizer rather than the $\\ell_1$ norm. We provide conditions for sparse recovery with IRKSN, and compare them with traditional conditions for recovery with $\\ell_1$ norm regularizers.

By leveraging such results we show that graphon representations of graphs and graph signals can be used as a common framework to compare sampling sets between graphs with different numbers of nodes and edges, and different node labelings. Additionally, given a sequence of graphs that converges to a graphon, we show that the sequences of sampling sets whose graphon representation is identical in $[0,1]$ are convergent as well. We exploit the convergence results to provide an algorithm that obtains approximately close to optimal sampling sets. Performing a set of numerical experiments, we evaluate the quality of these sampling sets.

In this paper, a unified NF and FF localization method is proposed for the RIS-enabled localization system to overcome the above issue. Specifically, the NF and FF regions are both divided into grids. The RIS reflects the signals from the user to the base station~(BS), and then the BS uses the received signals to determine the grid where the user is located. Compared with existing NF- or FF-only schemes, the design of the location estimation method and the RIS phase shift optimization algorithm is more challenging because they are based on a hybrid NF and FF model. To tackle these challenges, we formulate the optimization problems for location estimation and RIS phase shifts, and design two algorithms to effectively solve the formulated problems, respectively.

This paper proposes novel variational regularization methods to address this problem since they allow combining different mathematical concepts into a joint energy minimization framework. In this work, we incorporate concepts from signal sparsity into variational regularization for motion estimation. The proposed regularization uses a robust l1 norm, which promotes sparsity and handles motion discontinuities. By using this regularization, we promote the sparsity of the optical flow gradient. This sparsity helps recover a signal even with just a few measurements. We explore recovering optical flow from a limited set of linear measurements using this regularizer.

We demonstrate that both reduced SI and high angular resolution can be obtained by employing suitable sparse array configurations that fully leverage the available joint transmit-receive array aperture without suffering from angular ambiguities.

The presence of these holes requires re-thinking DOA estimation, as conventional algorithms may no longer be easily applicable and alternative techniques, such as array interpolation, may be computationally expensive. Consequently, we study sparse array geometries that permit the direct application of spatial smoothing. We show that a sparse array geometry is amenable to spatial smoothing if it can be decomposed into the sum set of two subsets of suitable cardinality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many such decompositions may exist - not all of them yielding equal identifiability or aperture. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee identifiability of a given number of targets, which gives insight into choosing desirable decompositions for spatial smoothing.

{"title": "Estimating the time-evolving refractivity of a turbulent medium using optical beam measurements: a data assimilation approach", "abstract": "In applications such as free-space optical communication, a signal is often recovered after propagation through a turbulent medium. In this setting, it is common to assume that limited information is known about the turbulent medium, such as a space- and time-averaged statistic (e.g., root-mean-square), but without information about the state of the spatial variations. It could be helpful to gain more information if the state of the turbulent medium can be characterized with the spatial variations and evolution in time described. Here, we propose to investigate the use of data assimilation techniques for this purpose. A computational setting is used with the paraxial wave equation, and the extended Kalman filter is used to conduct data assimilation using intensity measurements. To reduce computational cost, the evolution of the turbulent medium is modeled as a stochastic process. Following some past studies, the process has only a small number of Fourier wavelengths for spatial variations. The results show that the spatial and temporal variations of the medium are recovered accurately in many cases. In some time windows in some cases, the error is larger for the recovery.

However, this also inevitably incurs higher hardware and energy cost, which may not be affordable in future wireless systems. To address this issue, we propose in this paper to exploit two types of sparse arrays (SAs) for enabling near-field communications. Specifically, we first consider the linear sparse array (LSA) and characterize its near-field beam pattern. It is shown that despite the achieved beam-focusing gain, the LSA introduces several undesired grating-lobes, which have comparable beam power with the main-lobe and are focused on specific regions. An efficient hybrid beamforming design is then proposed for the LSA to deal with the potential strong inter-user interference (IUI). Next, we consider another form of SA, called extended coprime array (ECA), which is composed of two LSA subarrays with different (coprime) inter-antenna spacing. By characterizing the ECA near-field beam pattern, we show that compared with the LSA with the same array sparsity, the ECA can greatly suppress the beam power of near-field grating-lobes thanks to the offset effect of the two subarrays, albeit with a larger number of grating-lobes. This thus motivates us to propose a customized two-phase hybrid beamforming design for the ECA.

As the existing studies on MA-aided wireless communications have mainly considered narrow-band transmission in flat fading channels, we investigate in this paper the MA-aided wideband communications employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in frequency-selective fading channels. Under the general multi-tap field-response channel model, the wireless channel variations in both space and frequency are characterized with different positions of the MAs. Unlike the narrow-band transmission where the optimal MA position at the Tx/Rx simply maximizes the single-tap channel amplitude, the MA position in the wideband case needs to balance the amplitudes and phases over multiple channel taps in order to maximize the OFDM transmission rate over multiple frequency subcarriers. First, we derive an upper bound on the OFDM achievable rate in closed form when the size of the Tx/Rx region for antenna movement is arbitrarily large. Next, we develop a parallel greedy ascent (PGA) algorithm to obtain locally optimal solutions to the MAs' positions for OFDM rate maximization subject to finite-size Tx/Rx regions. To reduce computational complexity, a simplified PGA algorithm is also provided to optimize the MAs' positions more efficiently.

{"title": "The Stationary Wavelet Transform as an Efficient Reductor of Powerline Interference for Atrial Bipolar Electrograms in Cardiac Electrophysiology", "abstract": "Objective: The most relevant source of signal contamination in the cardiac electrophysiology (EP) laboratory is the ubiquitous powerline interference (PLI). To reduce this perturbation, algorithms including common fixed bandwidth and adaptive notch filters have been proposed. Although such methods have proven to add artificial fractionation to intra atrial electrograms (EGMs), they are still frequently used. However, such morphological alteration can conceal the accurate interpretation of EGMs, specially to evaluate the mechanisms supporting atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Given the clinical relevance of AF, a novel algorithm aimed at reducing PLI on highly contaminated bipolar EGMs and, simultaneously, preserving their morphology is proposed. Approach: The method is based on the wavelet shrinkage and has been validated through customized indices on a set of synthesized EGMs to accurately quantify the achieved level of PLI reduction and signal morphology alteration. Visual validation of the algorithms performance has also been included for some real EGM excerpts. Main results: The method has outperformed common filtering-based and wavelet based strategies in the analyzed scenario. Moreover, it possesses advantages such as insensitivity to amplitude and frequency variations in the PLI, and the capability of joint removal of several interferences. Significance: The use of this algorithm in routine cardiac EP studies may enable improved and truthful evaluation of AF mechanisms.", "authors": "Miguel Martinez-Iniesta, Juan Rodenas, Jose J.

Recently, there has been active research in Foley sound synthesis, leveraging the advancements in deep generative models. However, such works mainly focus on replicating a single sound class or a textual sound description, neglecting temporal information, which is crucial in the practical applications of Foley sound. We present T-Foley, a Temporal-event-guided waveform generation model for Foley sound synthesis. T-Foley generates high-quality audio using two conditions: the sound class and temporal event feature. For temporal conditioning, we devise a temporal event feature and a novel conditioning technique named Block-FiLM. T-Foley achieves superior performance in both objective and subjective evaluation metrics and generates Foley sound well-synchronized with the temporal events. Additionally, we showcase T-Foley's practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving vocal mimicry for temporal event control.

{"title": "Anchor-points Assisted Uplink Sensing in Perceptive Mobile Networks", "abstract": "Uplink sensing in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, such as Perceptive Mobile Networks, is challenging due to the clock asynchronism between transmitter and receiver. Existing solutions typically require the presence of a dominating line-of-sight path and the knowledge of transmitter location at the receiver. In this paper, relaxing these requirements, we propose a novel and effective uplink sensing scheme with the assistance of static anchor points. Two major algorithms are proposed in the scheme. The first algorithm estimates the relative timing and carrier frequency offsets due to clock asynchronism, with respect to those at a randomly selected reference snapshot. Theoretical performance analysis is provided for the algorithm. The estimates from the first algorithm are then used to compensate for the offsets and generate the angle-Doppler maps. Using the maps, the second algorithm identifies the anchor points, and then locates the UE and dynamic targets. Feasibility of UE localization is also analyzed.

In scenarios where traditional positioning equations cannot be adequately solved due to limited measurements obtained by the receiver, the utilization of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) based on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can prove pivotal for precise positioning. The decision to employ NTN in lieu of conventional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is rooted in two key factors. Firstly, GNSS systems are susceptible to jamming and spoofing attacks, thereby compromising their reliability, where LEO satellites link budgets can benefit from a closer distances and the new mega constellations could offer more satellites in view than GNSS. Secondly, 5G service providers seek to reduce dependence on third-party services. Presently, the NTN operation necessitates a GNSS receiver within the User Equipment (UE), placing the service provider at the mercy of GNSS reliability. Consequently, when GNSS signals are unavailable in certain regions, NTN services are also rendered inaccessible.", "authors": "Alejandro Gonzalez-Garrido, Jorge Querol, Henk Wymeersch, Symeon Chatzinotas", "date": "17 Jan 2024 ("},

This highly invasive intervention is still linked to a long-term recurrence rate of approximately 35% in permanent AF patients. The aim of this study is to preoperatively predict long-term AF recurrence post-surgery through the analysis of atrial activity (AA) organization from non-invasive electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings. A dataset comprising ECGs from 53 patients with permanent AF who had undergone Cox Maze concomitant surgery was analyzed. The AA was extracted from the lead V1 of these recordings and then characterized using novel predictors, such as the mean and standard deviation of the relative wavelet energy (RWEm and RWEs) across different scales, and an entropy-based metric that computes the stationary wavelet entropy variability (SWEnV). The individual predictors exhibited limited predictive capabilities to anticipate the outcome of the procedure, with the SWEnV yielding a classification accuracy (Acc) of 68.07%. However, the assessment of the RWEs for the seventh scale (RWEs7), which encompassed frequencies associated with the AA, stood out as the most promising individual predictor, with sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) values of 80.83% and 67.09%, respectively, and an Acc of almost 75%. Diverse multivariate decision tree-based models were constructed for prediction, giving priority to simplicity in the interpretation of the forecasting methodology. In fact, the combination of the SWEnV and RWEs7 consistently outperformed the individual predictors and excelled in predicting post-surgery outcomes one year after the Cox Maze procedure, with Se, Sp, and Acc values of approximately 80%, thus surpassing the results of previous studies based on anatomical predictors associated with atrial function or clinical data.", "authors": "P.

In particular, fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and its variants are deemed to play a fundamental role in the next generation of cellular deployments (B4G/5G systems). This paper presents an analytical framework allowing the downlink performance evaluation of FFR-aided OFDMA networks when using channel-aware scheduling policies. Remarkably, the framework contemplates the use of different rate allocation strategies, thus allowing to assess the network behaviour under ideal (capacity-based) or realistic (throughput-based) conditions. Analytical performance results are used to optimise the FFR parameters as a function of, for instance, the resource block scheduling policy or the density of UEs per cell. Furthermore, different optimisation designs of the FFR component are proposed that allow a tradeoff between throughput performance and fairness by suitably dimensioning the FFR-defined cell-centre and cell-edge areas and the corresponding frequency allocation to each region. Numerical results serve to confirm the accuracy of the proposed analytical model while providing insight on how the different parameters and designs affect network performance.", "authors": "Jan García Morales, Guillem Femenias, Felip Riera Palou", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Super-Directive Antenna Arrays: How Many Elements Do We Need?", "abstract": "Super-directive antenna arrays have faced challenges in achieving high realized gains ever since their introduction in the academic literature. The primary challenges are high impedance mismatches and resistive losses, which become increasingly more dominant as the number of elements increases. Consequently, a critical limitation arises in determining the maximum number of elements that should be utilized to achieve super-directivity, particularly within dense array configurations. This paper addresses precisely this issue through an optimization study to design a super-directive antenna array with a maximum number of elements. An iterative approach is employed to increase the array of elements while sustaining a satisfactory realized gain using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Thus, it is observed that super-directivity can be obtained in an array with a maximum of five elements. Our results indicate that the obtained unit array has a $67.20\\%$ higher realized gain than a uniform linear array with conventional excitation. For these reasons, these results make the proposed architecture a strong candidate for applications that require densely packed arrays, particularly in the context of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).", "authors": "Ihsan Kanbaz, Okan Yurduseven, Michail Matthaiou", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

However, the mid-term recurrence rate of this procedure in persistent AF patients is still limited and the preoperative prediction of its outcome is clinically interesting to select candidates who could benefit the most from the intervention. This context encouraged the study of C0 complexity as a novel predictor, because it estimates organization of the power spectral distribution (PSD) of the fibrillatory waves (f-waves). For that purpose, the PSD was divided into two divergent components using a threshold, theta, which was considered by multiplying the mean value of the PSD by a factor, alpha, ranging between 1.5 and 2.5. On a database of 74 patients, the values of C0 complexity computed for all alpha factors reported statistically significant differences between the patients who maintained sinus rhythm and those who relapsed to AF after a follow-up of 9 months. They also showed higher values of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and accuracy (Acc) than the well known predictors of the dominant frequency (DF) and f-wave amplitude. Moreover, the combination of the DF and the C0 complexity computed with alpha = 2, via a decision tree, improved classification until values of Se, Sp and Acc of 75.33, 77.33 and 76.58%, respectively.

Although the expected number of events is small (compared to, for example, inelastic neutrino-nucleus charged current interaction with xenon nuclei, that also gives rise to final state electrons), the distinct spectral shape of the scattered electrons may allow identification of the elastic scattering events. Further, while the process is dominated by neutrinos and antineutrinos of electron flavor, it receives contributions from all the six neutrino species. Identification of the electron scattering events may, therefore, allow an estimation of the relative fractions of the total supernova explosion energy going into electron flavored and non-electron flavored neutrinos.", "authors": "Pijushpani Bhattacharjee, Kamales Kar", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

To investigate the various factors that may affect the prevalence of AGNs in cluster galaxies, we selected a sample of 19 thoroughly studied X-ray-selected galaxy clusters from the LoCuSS survey. All these clusters are considered massive, with $M_{500}\\gtrsim 2\\times10^{14} M_{solar}$, and span a narrow redshift range between $z\\sim$0.16 and 0.28. We divided the cluster surroundings into two concentric annuli with a width of $R_{500}$ radius. We further divided the cluster sample based on the presence of infalling X-ray-detected groups, cluster mass, or dynamical state. We found that the X-ray AGN fraction in the outskirts is consistent with the field, but it is significantly lower in cluster centres, in agreement with previous results for massive clusters. We show that these results do not depend on cluster mass. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence of a spatial correlation between infalling groups and AGNs. Nevertheless, a significant excess of X-ray AGNs is found in the outskirts of relaxed clusters at the 2$\\sigma$ confidence level, compared both to non-relaxed clusters and to the field. Our results suggest that the mechanisms that trigger AGN activity may vary between cluster centres and the outskirts. Ram pressure can efficiently remove the gas from infalling galaxies, thereby triggering AGN activity in some cases. However, the reduced availability of gas globally diminishes the fraction of AGNs in cluster centers. The surplus of X-ray AGNs identified in the outskirts of relaxed clusters may be attributed to an increased frequency of galaxy mergers, a notion that is further supported by the disturbed morphology observed in several galaxies.", "authors": "E.

Previous studies on high-energy events of IceCube suggested that some of these events might be gamma-ray burst neutrinos, with their speeds varying linearly with their energy, implying also the coexistence of subluminal and superluminal propagation. However, a recent reanalysis of the data, incorporating revised directional information, reveals stronger signals that neutrinos are actually being slowed down compared to previous suggestion of neutrino speed variation. Thus, it is worth discussing its implications for the brane/string inspired framework of space-time foam, which has been used to explain previous observations. We revisit effects on neutrino propagation from specific foam models within the framework, indicating that the implied violation of Lorentz invariance could necessarily cause the neutrino to decelerate. We therefore argue that this sort of model is in agreement with the updated phenomenological indication just mentioned.

Evaporation of a cold disc by conduction from the hot corona has been proposed as a means of mediating the soft-to-hard state transitions observed in X-ray binary systems. We model the coronal plasma in our local disc patch as an MHD fluid subject to both free-streaming ion conduction and a parameterized cooling function that captures the collisional transfer of energy from hot ions to colder, rapidly cooling leptons. In all of our models, independent of the initial net vertical magnetic flux (NF) threading the disc, we find no evidence of disc evaporation. The ion heat flux into the disc is radiated away before conduction can heat the disc's surface layers. When an initial NF is present, steady-state temperature, density, and outflow velocities in our model coronae are unaffected by conduction. Instead of facilitating disc evaporation, thermal conduction is more likely to feed the disc with plasma condensing out of the corona, particularly in flows without NF. Our work indicates that uncertainties in the amount of NF threading the disc hold far greater influence over whether or not the disc will evaporate into a radiatively inefficient accretion flow compared to thermal conduction.

Although in the case of X-ray spectral fitting, the likelihood is known, we aim to investigate the neural networks ability to recover the model parameters but also their associated uncertainties, and compare its performance with standard X-ray spectral fitting, whether following a frequentist or Bayesian approach. We apply Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation (SBI-NPE) to X-ray spectra. We train a network with simulated spectra, and then it learns the mapping between the simulated spectra and their parameters and returns the posterior distribution. The model parameters are sampled from a predefined prior distribution. To maximize the efficiency of the training of the neural network, yet limiting the size of the training sample to speed up the inference, we introduce a way to reduce the range of the priors, either through a classifier or a coarse and quick inference of one or multiple observations. SBI-NPE is demonstrated to work equally well as standard X-ray spectral fitting, both in the Gaussian and Poisson regimes, both on simulated and real data, yielding fully consistent results in terms of best fit parameters and posterior distributions. The inference time is comparable to or smaller than the one needed for Bayesian inference. On the other hand, once properly trained, an amortized SBI-NPE network generates the posterior distributions in no time. We show that SBI-NPE is less sensitive to local minima trapping than standard fit statistic minimization techniques. We find that the neural network can be trained equally well on dimension-reduced spectra, via a Principal Component Decomposition, leading to a shorter inference time. Neural posterior estimation thus adds up as a complementary tool for X-ray spectral fitting. (abridged).", "authors": "Didier Barret, Simon Dupourqué", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

The Bethe-Heitler process offers a way of channeling energy stored in a population of relativistic protons (or nuclei) to relativistic pairs with extended distributions. Contrary to accelerated leptons, whose maximum energy is limited by radiative losses, the maximal energy of pairs is determined by the kinematics of the process and can be as high as the parent proton energy. We take a closer look at the features of the injected pair distribution, and provide a novel empirical function that describes the spectrum of pairs produced by interactions of single-energy protons with single-energy photons. The function is the kernel of the Bethe-Heitler pair production spectrum that replaces a double numerical integration involving the complex differential cross section of the process, and can be easily implemented in numerical codes. We further examine under which conditions Bethe-Heitler pairs produced in blazar jets can emit $\\gamma$-ray photons via synchrotron radiation, thus providing an alternative to the inverse Compton scattering process for high-energy emission in jetted active galactic nuclei. After taking into consideration the broadband spectral characteristics of the source, the jet energetics, and the properties of radiation fields present in the blazar environment, we conclude that $\\gamma$-rays in low- and intermediate-peaked blazars may arise from Bethe-Heitler pairs in regions of the jet with typical transverse size $\\sim 10^{15}$ cm and co-moving magnetic field $5-500$ G.", "authors": "Despina Karavola, Maria Petropoulou", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

We found 27 near-infrared AGN candidates possibly associated with 14 Fermi-LAT sources using the VVV survey. We also found 2 blazar candidates in the regions of 2 Fermi-LAT sources using WISE data. There is no match between VVV and WISE candidates. We have also examined the K$_\\mathrm{s}$ light curves of the VVV candidates and applied the fractional variability amplitude ($\\mathrm{\\sigma_{rms}}$) and the slope of variation in the K$_\\mathrm{s}$ passband to characterise the near-infrared variability. This analysis shows that more than 85% of the candidates have slopes in the K$_\\mathrm{s}$ passband $ > 10^{-4}$ mag/day and present $\\mathrm{\\sigma_{rms}}$ values consistent with a moderate variability. This is in good agreement with typical results seen from type-1 AGN. The combination of YJHK$_\\mathrm{s}$ colours and K$_\\mathrm{s}$ variability criteria was useful for AGN selection, including its use in identifying counterparts to Fermi $\\gamma$-ray sources.", "authors": "Laura G.

{"title": "Towards more accurate synthetic reflection spectra: improving the calculations of returning radiation", "abstract": "We present a new model to calculate reflection spectra of thin accretion disks in Kerr spacetimes. Our model includes the effect of returning radiation, which is the radiation that is emitted by the disk and returns to the disk because of the strong light bending near a black hole. The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of RELXILL (modified to read the table of REFLIONX, which is the non-relativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that RELXILL with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk's ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated. We can find better fits and recover the correct input parameters as the value of the black hole spin parameter decreases and the values of the coronal height and of the disk's ionization parameter increase.", "authors": "Temurbek Mirzaev, Shafqat Riaz, Askar B.

The metastable configurations are approximately but not exactly axisymmetric, causing the emission of persistent, quasimonochromatic, current quadrupole gravitational radiation. The characteristic gravitational wave strain $h_0$ as a function of the spin frequency $f$ and distance $D$ from the Earth is bounded above by $h_0 = 1.2\\substack{+1.3 \\\\ -0.9} \\times 10^{-32} (f/30\\;{\\rm Hz})^{2.5} (D/1\\;{\\rm kpc})^{-1}$, corresponding to a Poissonian spatial configuration (equal probability per unit area, i.e. zero inter-vortex repulsion), and bounded below by $h_0 = 1.8\\substack{+2.0 \\\\ -1.5} \\times 10^{-50} (f/30\\;{\\rm Hz})^{1.5} (D/1\\;{\\rm kpc})^{-1}$, corresponding to a regular array (periodic separation, i.e.\\ maximum inter-vortex repulsion).

The peak absolute V-band magnitude of SN 2021gmj is -15.5 mag, which is fainter than that of normal Type IIP SNe. The spectral evolution of SN 2021gmj resembles that of other sub-luminous supernovae: the optical spectra show narrow P-Cygni profiles, indicating a low expansion velocity. We estimate the progenitor mass to be about 12 Msun from the nebular spectrum and the 56Ni mass to be about 0.02 Msun from the bolometric light curve. We also derive the explosion energy to be about 3 x 10^{50} erg by comparing numerical light curve models with the observed light curves. Polarization in the plateau phase is not very large, suggesting nearly spherical outer envelope. The early photometric observations capture the rapid rise of the light curve, which is likely due to the interaction with a circumstellar material (CSM). The broad emission feature formed by highly-ionized lines on top of a blue continuum in the earliest spectrum gives further indication of the CSM at the vicinity of the progenitor.

The spectral type of the massive companion star has been difficult to retrieve as there is no optical counterpart, but the system is coincident with a near-infrared source. Previous results have shown that the infrared counterpart is consistent with an O or B type star, but a clear classification is still lacking. We observed the counterpart twice, in 2019 and 2021, with the X-Shooter spectrograph operating on the VLT. The obtained spectra classify the counterpart as an O6 V type star. We estimate a distance to the source of $6.7 \\pm 0.5$ kpc, although this estimate can be severely affected by the high extinction towards the source. This new O6 V classification for the companion star in HESS J1832-093 provides further support to an apparent grouping around a given spectral type for all discovered gamma-ray binaries that contain an O-type star.

This flux can be produced either by a population of Galactic point sources or by diffused emission from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium or by a mixture of both. In this work, we compute diffused gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes produced by a population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our Galaxy, assuming different parametrizations of the Galactic diffused cosmic ray distribution. In particular, we take into account two main cases: (I) constant cosmic ray luminosity in our Galaxy, and (II) space-dependent cosmic ray luminosity based on the supernovae distribution in our Galaxy. For Case-I, we found that the neutrino flux from GMCs is a factor of $\\sim 10$ below compared to $\\pi^0$ and KRA$_\\gamma$ best-fitted models of IceCube observations at $10^5$ GeV.

{"title": "Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Automated Fluid Administration in Critical Care", "abstract": "Fluid administration, also called fluid resuscitation, is a medical treatment to restore the lost blood volume and optimize cardiac functions in critical care scenarios such as burn, hemorrhage, and septic shock. Automated fluid administration systems (AFAS), a potential means to improve the treatment, employ computational control algorithms to automatically adjust optimal fluid infusion dosages by targeting physiological variables (e.g., blood volume or blood pressure). Most of the existing AFAS control algorithms are model-based approaches, and their performance is highly dependent on the model accuracy, making them less desirable in real-world care of critically ill patients due to complexity and variability of modeling patients physiological states. This work presents a novel model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach for the control of fluid infusion dosages in AFAS systems. The proposed RL agent learns to adjust the blood volume to a desired value by choosing the optimal infusion dosages using a Q-learning algorithm. The RL agent learns the optimal actions by interacting with the environment (without having the knowledge of system dynamics). The proposed methodology (i) overcomes the need for a precise mathematical model in AFAS systems and (ii) provides a robust performance in rejecting clinical noises and reaching desired hemodynamic states, as will be shown by simulation results.", "authors": "Elham Estiri, Hossein Mirinejad", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than $1$ year for vector interactions and $10^4$ years for scalar interactions.", "authors": "Nicole F.

Specifically, we consider policy iteration applied to the linear quadratic regulator problem. Two iterative procedures, where data collected from the system are repeatedly used to compute new estimates of the desired optimal controller, are considered. In indirect policy iteration, data are used to obtain an updated model estimate through a recursive identification scheme, which is used in a certainty-equivalent fashion to perform the classic policy iteration update. By casting the concurrent model identification and control design as a feedback interconnection between two algorithmic systems, we provide a closed-loop analysis that shows convergence and robustness properties for arbitrary levels of excitation in the data. In direct policy iteration, data are used to approximate the value function and design the associated controller without requiring the intermediate identification step. After proposing an extension to a recently proposed scheme that overcomes potential identifiability issues, we establish under which conditions this procedure is guaranteed to deliver the optimal controller. Based on these analyses we are able to compare the strengths and limitations of the two approaches, highlighting aspects such as the required samples, convergence properties, and excitation requirement.

{"title": "Testing Cosmic-Ray Propagation Scenarios with AMS-02 and Voyager Data", "abstract": "AMS-02 on board the ISS provides precise measurements of Cosmic Rays (CR) near Earth, while Voyager measures CR in the local interstellar medium, beyond the effects of solar modulation. Based on these data, we test and revise various CR propagation scenarios under standard assumptions: pure diffusion, diffusion with convection, diffusion with reacceleration, and diffusion with reacceleration and convection. We report on the scenarios' performance against CR measurements, aiming to limit the number of model parameters as much as possible. For each scenario we find parameters that are able to reproduce Voyager and AMS-02 data for the entire energy band for all the CR species tested. Above several GV we observe a similar injection spectral index for He and C, with He harder than H. Some scenarios previously disfavored are now reconsidered. For example, contrary to usual assumptions, we find that the pure diffusion scenario does not need an upturn in the diffusion coefficient at low energy, while it needs the same number of low-energy breaks in the injection spectrum as diffusive-reacceleration scenarios. We show that scenarios differ in modeled spectra of one order of magnitude for positrons at around 1 GeV and of a factor of 2 for antiprotons at several GV. The force-field approximation describes well the AMS-02 and Voyager spectra analyzed, except antiprotons. We confirm the excess around 10 GeV in the antiproton spectrum for all scenarios.

{"title": "Gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity via geodesic deviation", "abstract": "We investigate gravitational waves in the $f(Q)$ gravity, i.e., a geometric theory of gravity described by a non-metric compatible connection, free from torsion and curvature, known as symmetric-teleparallel gravity. We show that $f(Q)$ gravity exhibits only two massless and tensor modes. Their polarizations are transverse with helicity equal to two, exactly reproducing the plus and cross tensor modes typical of General Relativity. In order to analyze these gravitational waves, we first obtain the deviation equation of two trajectories followed by nearby freely falling point-like particles and we find it to coincide with the geodesic deviation of General Relativity. This is because the energy-momentum tensor of matter and field equations are Levi-Civita covariantly conserved and, therefore, free structure-less particles follow, also in $f(Q)$ gravity, the General Relativity geodesics. Equivalently, it is possible to show that the curves are solutions of a force equation, where an extra force term of geometric origin, due to non-metricity, modifies the autoparallel curves with respect to the non-metric connection. In summary, gravitational waves produced in non-metricity-based $f(Q)$ gravity behave as those in torsion-based $f(T)$ gravity and it is not possible to distinguish them from those of General Relativity only by wave polarization measurements. This shows that the situation is different with respect to the curvature-based $f(R)$ gravity where an additional scalar mode is always present for $f(R)\\neq R$.", "authors": "Salvatore Capozziello, Maurizio Capriolo, Shin'ichi Nojiri", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Instability windows of relativistic r-modes", "abstract": "The detectability of the gravitational-wave signal from $r$-modes depends on the interplay between the amplification of the mode by the CFS instability and its damping due to dissipative mechanisms present in the stellar matter. The instability window of $r$-modes describes the region of stellar parameters (angular velocity, $\\Omega$, and redshifted stellar temperature, $T^\\infty$), for which the mode is unstable. In this study, we reexamine this problem in nonbarotropic neutron stars, taking into account the previously overlooked nonanalytic behavior (in $\\Omega$) of relativistic $r$-modes and enhanced energy dissipation resulting from diffusion in superconducting stellar matter. We demonstrate that at slow rotation rates, relativistic $r$-modes exhibit weaker amplification by the CFS instability compared to Newtonian ones. However, their dissipation through viscosity and diffusion is significantly more efficient. In rapidly rotating neutron stars within the framework of general relativity, the amplification of $r$-modes by the CFS mechanism and their damping due to shear viscosity become comparable to those predicted by Newtonian theory. In contrast, the relativistic damping of the mode by diffusion and bulk viscosity remains significantly stronger than in the nonrelativistic case. Consequently, account for diffusion and general relativity leads to a substantial modification of the $r$-mode instability window compared to the Newtonian prediction. This finding is important for the interpretation of observations of rotating neutron stars, as well as for overall understanding of $r$-mode physics.", "authors": "Kirill Y. Kraav, Mikhail E.

In order to close the gap between the nonlinear multi-body SAVGS model and its linear equivalent, a new uncertain system characterization is proposed that captures unmodeled dynamics, parameter variation, and external disturbances. Based on the newly proposed linear uncertain model for the quarter car SAVGS system, a constrained optimal control problem (OCP) is presented in the form of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization. More specifically, utilizing semidefinite relaxation techniques a state-feedback robust model predictive control (RMPC) scheme is presented and integrated with the nonlinear multi-body SAVGS model, where state-feedback gain and control perturbation are computed online to optimise performance, while physical and design constraints are preserved. Numerical simulation results with different ISO-defined road events demonstrate the robustness and significant performance improvement in terms of ride comfort and road holding of the proposed approach, as compared to the conventional passive suspension, as well as, to actively controlled SAVGS by a previously developed conventional H-infinity control scheme.", "authors": "Zilin Feng, Anastasis Georgiou, Min Yu, Simos A.

After 12~days and 4~hours aloft, the flight was terminated prematurely in the Pacific Ocean. Before the flight, the instrument was tested extensively in the West Desert of Utah, USA, with UV point sources and lasers. The test results indicated that the instrument had sensitivity to EASs of approximately 3 EeV.

Supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, young stellar clusters and superbubbles are considered as possible sites of PeV-regime particles producing the radiation. Another possible source of PeV particles could be gamma-ray binary systems. In these systems, a strong relativistic outflow from a compact object (neutron star or black hole) collides with the dense wind from a massive companion early-type star. Gamma-ray binaries are observed from radio to high energy gamma-rays as luminous non-thermal sources. Apart from acceleration of very high energy leptons producing most of the non-thermal radiation, these systems may also efficiently accelerate protons. We present here the results of numerical simulation of the PeV-regime proton acceleration in gamma-ray binaries. The simulation is based on relativistic MHD modeling of local flows of magnetized plasma in the region of interaction of two colliding winds. We then inject 0.1 PeV protons into the system and directly follow their trajectories to demonstrate that they are accelerated to energies above PeV. High magnetization of the wind of the young massive star providing a Gauss range field in the winds interaction region is of paramount importance for the acceleration of protons above PeV. The maximum energies of protons accelerated by colliding winds in gamma ray binaries can significantly exceed the energy of the pulsar potential's drop, which limits from above the energy of particles accelerated by an isolated pulsar.", "authors": "A.

This paper focused on solving this issue by proposing decentralized processing cores that could improve the landing failure rate by depending on a Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) and additional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) elements.

A stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based latent factor analysis (LFA) model is remarkably effective in extracting valuable information from an HDI matrix.

To address this critical issue, this paper innovatively proposes an ADRC-incorporated SGD (ADS) algorithm by refining the instance learning error by considering the historical and future state by following the principle of an ADRC controller. With it, an ADS-based LFA model is further achieved for fast and accurate latent factor analysis on an HDI matrix.

We present a novel method for including host-mass correlations in the SALT3 light curve model used for standardising SN Ia distances. We split the SALT3 training sample according to host-mass, training independent models for the low- and high-host-mass samples. Our models indicate that there are different average Si II spectral feature strengths between the two populations, and that the average SED of SNe from low-mass galaxies is bluer than the high-mass counterpart. We then use our trained models to perform a SN cosmology analysis on the 3-year spectroscopically confirmed Dark Energy Survey SN sample, treating SNe from low- and high-mass host galaxies as separate populations throughout. We find that our mass-split models reduce the Hubble residual scatter in the sample, albeit at a low statistical significance. We do find a reduction in the mass-correlated luminosity step but conclude that this arises from the model-dependent re-definition of the fiducial SN absolute magnitude rather than the models themselves.

The current number of $O(100)$ detections is expected to grow by several orders of magnitude over the next two decades. As a result, current computationally expensive detection algorithms will become impractical. A solution to this problem, which has been explored in the last years, is the application of machine-learning techniques to accelerate the detection and parameter estimation of gravitational wave sources. In this chapter, several different applications are summarized, including the application of artificial neural networks and autoenconders in accelerating the computation of surrogate models, deep residual networks in achieving rapid detections with high sensitivity, as well as artificial neural networks for accelerating the construction of neutron star models in an alternative theory of gravity.", "authors": "Nikolaos Stergioulas", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Observational imprints of gravastars from accretion disks and hot-spots", "abstract": "In this work, we analyze the observational properties of thin-shell gravastars under two astrophysical frameworks, namely surrounded by optically-thin accretion disks and orbited by hot-spots. We consider the thin-shell gravastar model with two free parameters, the gravastar radius and ratio of mass allocated at the thin-shell, and produce the corresponding observables via the use of numerical backwards ray-tracing codes. Regarding the observations of accretion disks, our results indicate that, due to the absence of a strong gravitational redshift effect, smooth gravastar configurations cannot reproduce shadow observations when internal emission is assumed. We thus expect such models to be excluded as candidates for supermassive objects in galactic cores. Nevertheless, thin-shell gravastars with a large portion of their total mass allocated at the surface can produce such an effect and are thus adequate candidates for black-hole mimickers. In the context of hot-spot orbits, the astrometrical observational properties of ultra-compact gravastars resemble closely those of other ultra-compact objects e.g. fluid stars and bosonic stars. However, for low-compacticity configurations, the time-integrated fluxes feature additional contributions in the form of a high-intensity plunge through image. These qualitative differences in the observational properties of gravastars in comparison with black-hole spacetimes could potentially be discriminated by the next generation of interferometric experiments in gravitational physics.", "authors": "João Luís Rosa, Daniela S.

Our extensive in-field evaluations reveal that while Cartographer excels under nominal conditions, it struggles when subjected to wheel-slip, a common phenomenon in a racing scenario due to varying grip levels and aggressive driving behaviour.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the influence of delays in different target signals on the ANC performance and provide an intuitive explanation for how the system obtains the desired signal. Simulations were conducted on a pair of open-fitting hearables for localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment. The performance was assessed in terms of noise reduction, signal quality and control effort. Results indicate that optimal performance is achieved without delays when the target signal is defined at the error microphone, whereas causality necessitates delays when the target signal is defined at the reference microphone.

{"title": "Towards Uncovering Dark Matter Effects on Neutron Star Properties: A Machine Learning Approach", "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in understanding how dark matter affects neutron stars, helping them to better understand complex astrophysical phenomena. In this paper, we delve deeper into this problem by using advanced machine learning techniques to find potential connections between dark matter and various neutron star characteristics. We employ Random Forest classifiers to analyze neutron star (NS) properties and investigate whether these stars exhibit characteristics indicative of dark matter admixture. Our dataset includes 32,000 sequences of simulated NS properties, each described by mass, radius, and tidal deformability, inferred using recent observations and theoretical models. We explore a two-fluid model for the NS, incorporating separate equations of state for nucleonic and dark matter, with the latter considering a fermionic dark matter scenario. Our classifiers are trained and validated in a variety of feature sets, including the tidal deformability for various masses. Based on confusion matrices, these classifiers can identify NS with admixed dark matter with approximately 17% probability of misclassification. In particular, we find that additional tidal deformability data do not significantly improve the precision of our predictions. This article also delves into the potential of specific NS properties as indicators of the presence of dark matter. Radius measurements, especially at extreme mass values, emerge as particularly promising features. The insights gained from our study will guide future observational strategies and enhance dark matter detection capabilities. According to this study, neutron stars at 1.4 and 2.07 solar masses have radii that strongly suggest dark matter in neutron stars more likely than just hadronic composition, based on NICER data from pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620.", "authors": "Prashant Thakur, Tuhin Malik, T.

{"title": "Solution of the Probabilistic Lambert Problem: Connections with Optimal Mass Transport, Schrödinger Bridge and Reaction-Diffusion PDEs", "abstract": "Lambert's problem concerns with transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within prescribed flight time via velocity control subject to a gravitational force field. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors are replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is in fact a generalized SBP, and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schrödinger factors, as we do in this work. We explain how the resulting analysis leads to solving a boundary-coupled system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the nonlinear gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate. We propose novel algorithms for the same, and present illustrative numerical results. Our analysis and the algorithmic framework are nonparametric, i.e., we make neither statistical (e.g., Gaussian, first few moments, mixture or exponential family, finite dimensionality of the sufficient statistic) nor dynamical (e.g., Taylor series) approximations.", "authors": "Alexis M.H.

The original layout of the 4-DoF manipulator presents Type-II singular configurations within its workspace. Thus, we proposed to reconfigure the manipulator to avoid such singularities (owing to the Forward Jacobian of the PKM) during typical rehabilitation trajectories. We achieve the reconfiguration of the PKM through a minimization problem where the design variables correspond to the anchoring points of the robot limbs on fixed and mobile platforms. The objective function relies on the minimization of the forces exerted by the actuators for a specific trajectory. The minimization problem considers constraint equations to avoid Type-II singularities, which guarantee the feasibility of the active generalized coordinates for a particular path. To evaluate the proposed conceptual strategy, we build a prototype where reconfiguration occurs by moving the position of the anchoring points to holes bored in the fixed and mobile platforms. Simulations and experiments of several study cases enable testing the strategy performance. The results show that the reconfiguration strategy allows obtaining trajectories having minimum actuation forces without Type-II singularities.", "authors": "Francisco Valero, Miguel Diaz-Rodriguez, Marina Valles, Antonio Besa, Enrique Bernabeu, Angel Valera", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

Passive limit cycles can emerge for such systems and be exploited for energy-efficient control. A grand challenge in locomotion is trunk stabilization when the hip is offset from the center of mass (CoM).

In this work, the authors consider a robot hopper model (RHM) with a rigid trunk and leg plus a hip that is displaced from the CoM. It has been previously shown that no passive limit cycle exists for such a model given a linear hip spring. In this work, we show that passive limit cycles can be found when a nonlinear hip spring is used instead.

{"title": "Constraints on the isovector properties of finite nuclei from neutron stars observations", "abstract": "The nuclear symmetry energy plays important role on the structure of finite nuclei as well as on the bulk properties of neutron stars. However, its values at high densities are completely uncertain and the corresponding experimental data have a large error. One possibility to determine or at least estimate the values at high densities is with the help of neutron star observations. Recently, observations of gravitational waves from merging processes of binary neutron star systems provide useful information on both their radius and tidal deformability, quantities directly related to the symmetry energy. In this work, an attempt is made in this direction, namely to see how recent observations can help to constrain the structure of finite nuclei. In particular, in the present study we parameterize the equation of state which describes the asymmetric and symmetric nuclear mater with the help of the parameter $\\eta=(K_0 L^2)^{1/3}$, where $K_0$ is the incompressibility and $L$ the slope parameter. The parameter $\\eta$ is a regulator of the stiffness of the equation of state. We expect that the values of $\\eta$ affect both the properties of finite nuclei as well as of the neutron star properties (where the role of the isovector interaction plays important role). It is natural to expect that constraints, via the parameter $\\eta$ on finite nuclei will imply constraints on the neutron star properties and vice versa. In view of the above statements we propose a simple but self-consistent method to examine simultaneously the effects of the parameter $\\eta$ on the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars.

From this panoramic perspective, we have discovered correlations between explosion energy, neutron star gravitational birth masses, $^{56}$Ni and $\\alpha$-rich freeze-out yields, and pulsar kicks and theoretically important correlations with the compactness parameter of progenitor structure. We find a correlation between explosion energy and progenitor mantle binding energy, suggesting that such explosions are self-regulating.

While the correlations between two observables are roughly independent of the progenitor ZAMS mass, the many correlations we derive with compactness can not unambiguously be tied to a particular progenitor ZAMS mass. This relationship depends upon the compactness/ZAMS mass mapping associated with the massive star progenitor models employed. Therefore, our derived correlations between compactness and observables may be more robust than with ZAMS mass, but can nevertheless be used in the future once massive star modeling has converged.", "authors": "Adam Burrows, Tianshu Wang, David Vartanyan", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},

Analytical modeling of the quasi bolometric light curves of SN 2020udy suggests that 0.08$\\pm$0.01 M$_{\\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni would have been synthesized during the explosion. Spectral features of SN 2020udy are similar to the bright members of type Iax class showing weak Si {\\sc II} line. The late-time spectral sequence is mostly dominated by Iron Group Elements (IGEs) with broad emission lines. Abundance tomography modeling of the spectral time series of SN~2020udy using TARDIS indicates stratification in the outer ejecta, however, to confirm this, spectral modeling at a very early phase is required. After maximum light, uniform mixing of chemical elements is sufficient to explain the spectral evolution. Unlike the case of normal type Ia SNe, the photospheric approximation remains robust until +100 days, requiring an additional continuum source.

{"title": "An Analytical Framework for Modeling and Synthesizing Malicious Attacks on ACC Vehicles", "abstract": "While emerging adaptive cruise control (ACC) technologies are making their way into more vehicles, they also expose a vulnerability to potential malicious cyberattacks. Previous research has typically focused on constant or stochastic attacks without explicitly addressing their malicious and covert characteristics. As a result, these attacks may inadvertently benefit the compromised vehicles, inconsistent with real-world scenarios. In contrast, we establish an analytical framework to model and synthesize a range of candidate attacks, offering a physical interpretation from the attacker's standpoint. Specifically, we introduce a mathematical framework that describes mixed traffic scenarios, comprising ACC vehicles and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), grounded in car-following dynamics. Within this framework, we synthesize and integrate a class of false data injection attacks into ACC sensor measurements, influencing traffic flow dynamics. As a first-of-its-kind study, this work provides an analytical characterization of attacks, emphasizing their malicious and stealthy attributes while explicitly accounting for vehicle driving behavior, thereby yielding a set of candidate attacks with physical interpretability. To demonstrate the modeling process, we perform a series of numerical simulations to holistically assess the effects of attacks on car-following dynamics, traffic efficiency, and vehicular fuel consumption. The primary findings indicate that strategically synthesized candidate attacks can cause significant disruptions to the traffic flow while altering the driving behavior of ACC vehicles in a subtle fashion to remain stealthy, which is supported by a series of analytical results.", "authors": "Shian Wang", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A hierarchical control framework for autonomous decision-making systems: Integrating HMDP and MPC", "abstract": "This paper proposes a comprehensive hierarchical control framework for autonomous decision-making arising in robotics and autonomous systems. In a typical hierarchical control architecture, high-level decision making is often characterised by discrete state and decision/control sets. However, a rational decision is usually affected by not only the discrete states of the autonomous system, but also the underlying continuous dynamics even the evolution of its operational environment. This paper proposes a holistic and comprehensive design process and framework for this type of challenging problems, from new modelling and design problem formulation to control design and stability analysis. It addresses the intricate interplay between traditional continuous systems dynamics utilized at the low levels for control design and discrete Markov decision processes (MDP) for facilitating high-level decision making. We model the decision making system in complex environments as a hybrid system consisting of a controlled MDP and autonomous (i.e. uncontrolled) continuous dynamics. Consequently, the new formulation is called as hybrid Markov decision process (HMDP). The design problem is formulated with a focus on ensuring both safety and optimality while taking into account the influence of both the discrete and continuous state variables of different levels. With the help of the model predictive control (MPC) concept, a decision maker design scheme is proposed for the proposed hybrid decision making model. By carefully designing key ingredients involved in this scheme, it is shown that the recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed autonomous decision making scheme are guaranteed. The proposed framework is applied to develop an autonomous lane changing system for intelligent vehicles.", "authors": "Xue-Fang Wang, Jingjing Jiang, Wen-Hua Chen", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Advanced safety filter based on SOS Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel safety filter framework based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov-like Functions (CLFs). The CBF guarantees forward invariance of the safe set, constraining system trajectories within state constraints, while the CLF guides the system away from unsafe states towards a nominal region, preserving the performance of a nominal controller. The first part of this work focuses on determining compatible CBF and CLF in the presence of linear or quadratic input constraints. This is achieved by formulating the CBF and CLF conditions, along with the input constraints, as Sum of Squares (SOS) constraints using Putinar's Positivstellensatz. For solving the resulting SOS optimization problem, we employ an alternating algorithm that simultaneously searches for a feasible controller in the class of rational functions of the state. The second part of this work details the implementation of the safety filter as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP), whose constraints encode the CBF and CLF conditions as well as the input constraints. To avoid the chattering effect and guarantee the uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of solutions, the state-dependent inequality constraints of the QCQP are selected to be sufficiently regular.

{"title": "Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control for Unknown Linear Time-Invariant Systems", "abstract": "This paper presents a new robust data-driven predictive control scheme for unknown linear time-invariant systems by using input-state-output or input-output data based on whether the state is measurable. To remove the need for the persistently exciting (PE) condition of a sufficiently high order on pre-collected data, a set containing all systems capable of generating such data is constructed. Then, at each time step, an upper bound of a given objective function is derived for all systems in the set, and a feedback controller is designed to minimize this bound. The optimal control gain at each time step is determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. We prove that if the synthesis problem is feasible at the initial time step, it remains feasible for all future time steps. Unlike current data-driven predictive control schemes based on behavioral system theory, our approach requires less stringent conditions for the pre-collected data, facilitating easier implementation. Further, the proposed predictive control scheme features an infinite prediction horizon, potentially resulting in superior overall control performance compared to existing methods with finite prediction horizons.

We use the modal decomposition approach and consider boundary or non-local sensing together with non-local actuation, or Neumann actuation with non-local sensing. To compensate the output delay that appears in the infinite-dimensional part of the closed-loop system, for the first time for delayed PDEs we suggest a vector Lyapunov functional combined with the recently introduced vector Halanay inequality. We provide linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for finding the observer dimension and upper bounds on delays that preserve the exponential stability. We prove that the LMIs are always feasible for large enough observer dimension and small enough upper bounds on delays. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of our method and shows that the employment of vector Halanay's inequality allows for larger delays than the classical scalar Halanay inequality for comparatively large observer dimension.", "authors": "Pengfei Wang, Emilia Fridman", "date": "14 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Flat Spectra of Energetic Particles in Interplanetary Shock Precursors", "abstract": "The observed energy spectra of accelerated particles at interplanetary shocks often do not match the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) theory predictions. In some cases, the particle flux forms a plateau over a wide range of energies, extending upstream of the shock for up to seven flux's e-folds before submerging into the background spectrum. Remarkably, at and behind the shock that we have studied in detail, the flux falls off in energy as $\\epsilon^{-1}$, consistent with the DSA prediction for a strong shock. The upstream plateau suggests a different particle transport mechanism than those traditionally employed in DSA models. We show that a standard (linear) DSA solution based on a widely accepted diffusive particle transport with an underlying resonant wave-particle interaction is inconsistent with the plateau in the particle flux. To resolve this contradiction, we modify the DSA theory in two ways. First, we include a dependence of the particle diffusivity $\\kappa$ on the particle flux $F$ (nonlinear particle transport). Second, we invoke short-scale magnetic perturbations that are self-consistently generated by, but not resonant with, accelerated particles. They lead to the particle diffusivity increasing with the particle energy as $\\propto\\epsilon^{3/2}$ that simultaneously decreases with the particle flux as $1/F$.

{"title": "Low-cost, Lightweight Electronic Flow Regulators for Throttling Liquid Rocket Engines", "abstract": "For small-scale liquid rockets, pressure-fed systems are commonly favoured due to their simplicity and low weight. In such systems, accurate regulation of both tank and injector pressures over a wide range of upstream pressures is critical $-$ more accurate regulation allows for higher engine efficiency and minimal tank mass, thus improving flight performance. However, existing methods such as dome-loaded pressure regulators are inflexible, or require extensive characterization to function accurately. These methods also suffer from limited orifice size, droop, and slow reaction times, making them unsuitable for throttling by adjusting pressures in flight, which are increasingly important as propulsively landing rockets become more common. To overcome these challenges, we designed an electronic pressure regulator (eReg), a multi-input multi-output system utilising closed loop feedback to accurately control downstream pressures. Our design is simple, low-cost and robust: with a single ball valve actuated by a motor, we regulate both gaseous pressurant and cryogenic liquid propellant at high flow rates (1.14 kg/s of liquid; 0.39 kg/s of gas) and upstream pressures (310 bar). Using 2 eRegs to regulate propellant tank pressures, and 2 eRegs for regulating propellant flow to the engine, we demonstrated our system's ability, in a static fire test, to regulate pressures accurately (within 0.2 bar) while simultaneously throttling our engine.

The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the first satellite devoted to exploring the sky in polarised X-rays, has observed four magnetars to date. A proper interpretation of IXPE results requires the development of new atmospheric models that can take into proper account the effects of the magnetised vacuum on par with those of the plasma. Here we investigate the effects of mode conversion at the vacuum resonance on the polarisation properties of magnetar emission by computing plane-parallel atmospheric models under varying conditions of magnetic field strength/orientation, effective temperature and allowing for either complete or partial adiabatic mode conversion. Complete mode conversion results in a switch of the dominant polarisation mode, from the extraordinary (X) to the ordinary (O) one, below an energy that decreases with increasing magnetic field strength, occurring at $\\approx 0.5\\, \\mathrm{keV}$ for a magnetic field strength of $B=10^{14}\\, \\mathrm{G}$.

{"title": "Power Flow Analysis Using Deep Neural Networks in Three-Phase Unbalanced Smart Distribution Grids", "abstract": "Most power systems' approaches are currently tending towards stochastic and probabilistic methods due to the high variability of renewable sources and the stochastic nature of loads. Conventional power flow (PF) approaches such as forward-backward sweep (FBS) and Newton-Raphson require a high number of iterations to solve non-linear PF equations making them computationally very intensive. PF is the most important study performed by utility, required in all stages of the power system, especially in operations and planning. This paper discusses the applications of deep learning (DL) to predict PF solutions for three-phase unbalanced power distribution grids. Three deep neural networks (DNNs); Radial Basis Function Network (RBFnet), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are proposed in this paper to predict PF solutions. The PF problem is formulated as a multi-output regression model where two or more output values are predicted based on the inputs. The training and testing data are generated through the OpenDSS-MATLAB COM interface. These methods are completely data-driven where the training relies on reducing the mismatch at each node without the need for the knowledge of the system. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that the models can accurately predict the PF solutions for the unbalanced distribution grids with mutual coupling and are robust to different R/X ratios, topology changes as well as generation and load variability introduced by the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs). To test the efficacy of the DNN models, they are applied to IEEE 4-node and 123-node test cases, and the American Electric Power (AEP) feeder model. The PF results for RBFnet, MLP, and CNN models are discussed in this paper demonstrating that all three DNN models provide highly accurate results in predicting PF solutions.", "authors": "Deepak Tiwari, Mehdi Jabbari Zideh, Veeru Talreja, Vishal Verma, Sarika K.

The input parameters used for the simulation are obtained from semi-analytical solutions. This code is based on the TVD routine and correctly handles the angular momentum transport due to viscosity. The thermodynamic properties of the flow are described by a variable adiabatic index equation of state. We regenerate the inviscid and viscous steady-state solutions, including shocks, using the simulation code and compare them with the semi-analytical solutions. The angular momentum piles up across a shock due to shock-jump conditions and viscous transport of angular momentum. This will push the shock-front outward and can result in shock oscillation or a complete destabilization of shock. We study how shocks behave in the presence of viscosity. As the viscosity parameter ($\\alpha$) crosses a critical value, the previously steady shock becomes time-dependent, eventually leading to oscillations. The value of this critical viscosity depends on the injection angular momentum ($\\\\lambda_{ou}$) and the specific energy ($\\epsilon$). We estimated the posteriori bremsstrahlung and synchrotron cooling, and the net radiative output also oscillates with the frequency of the shock. We also study the variation of frequency, amplitude, and mean position of oscillation with $\\alpha$.

For pulsars below an ecliptic latitude of $5^\\circ$, the ionised plasma in the solar wind can introduce dispersive delays of order 100 microseconds around solar conjunction at an observing frequency of 300 MHz. A common approach to mitigate this assumes a spherical solar wind with a time-constant amplitude. However, this has been shown to be insufficient to describe the solar wind. We present a linear, Gaussian-process piecewise Bayesian approach to fit a spherical solar wind of time-variable amplitude, which has been implemented in the pulsar software run_enterprise. Through simulations, we find that the current EPTA+InPTA data combination is not sensitive to such variations; however, solar wind variations will become important in the near future with the addition of new InPTA data and data collected with the low-frequency LOFAR telescope. We also compare our results for different high-precision timing datasets (EPTA+InPTA, PPTA, and LOFAR) of three millisecond pulsars (J0030$+$0451, J1022$+$1001, J2145$-$0450), and find that the solar-wind amplitudes are generally consistent for any individual pulsar, but they can vary from pulsar to pulsar.

We identified eight reverberation-mapped AGNs with some of the largest known accretion rates without high-quality X-ray data. We obtained new Chandra ACIS-S X-ray observations and nearly simultaneous optical spectrophotometry to investigate the properties of these AGNs with extreme super-Eddington accreting black holes (SEAMBHs). We combined our new X-ray measurements with those of other reverberation-mapped AGNs, which have the best-determined masses and accretion rates. The trend of the steepening of the spectral slope between X-ray and optical-UV, $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$, with increasing optical-UV luminosity, $L_{2500Å}$, holds true for even the most extreme SEAMBHs. One of our new SEAMBHs appears X-ray weak for its luminosity, perhaps due to absorption associated with orientation effects involving a slim disk thought to be present in highly accreting systems. The correlation of the $\\rm 2-8~ keV$ X-ray photon index with the accretion rate also holds for the extreme SEAMBHs, which show some of the largest photon indices reported for AGNs.", "authors": "Jaya Maithil, Michael S.

{"title": "Learning Soft Constrained MPC Value Functions: Efficient MPC Design and Implementation providing Stability and Safety Guarantees", "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be applied to safety-critical control problems, providing closed-loop safety and performance guarantees. Implementation of MPC controllers requires solving an optimization problem at every sampling instant, which is challenging to execute on embedded hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that combines a tightened soft constrained MPC formulation with supervised learning to approximate the MPC value function. This combination enables us to obtain a corresponding optimal control law, which can be implemented efficiently on embedded platforms. The framework ensures stability and constraint satisfaction for various nonlinear systems. While the design effort is similar to that of nominal MPC, the proposed formulation provides input-to-state stability (ISS) with respect to the approximation error of the value function. Furthermore, we prove that the value function corresponding to the soft constrained MPC problem is Lipschitz continuous for Lipschitz continuous systems, even if the optimal control law may be discontinuous. This serves two purposes: First, it allows to relate approximation errors to a sufficiently large constraint tightening to obtain constraint satisfaction guarantees. Second, it paves the way for an efficient supervised learning procedure to obtain a continuous value function approximation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a nonlinear numerical example.", "authors": "Nicolas Chatzikiriakos, Kim P.

{"title": "Optical spectroscopy of blazars for the Cherenkov Telescope Array -- III", "abstract": "Due to their almost featureless optical/UV spectra, it is challenging to measure the redshifts of BL Lacs. As a result, about 50% of gamma-ray BL Lacs lack a firm measurement of this property, which is fundamental for population studies, indirect estimates of the EBL, and fundamental physics probes. This paper is the third in a series of papers aimed at determining the redshift of a sample of blazars selected as prime targets for future observations with the next generation, ground-based VHE gamma-ray astronomy observatory, Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The accurate determination of the redshift of these objects is an important aid in source selection and planning of future CTAO observations. The selected targets were expected to be detectable with CTAO in observations of 30 hours or less. We performed deep spectroscopic observations of 41 of these blazars using the Keck II, Lick, SALT, GTC, and ESO/VLT telescopes. We carefully searched for spectral lines in the spectra and whenever features of the host galaxy were detected, we attempted to model the properties of the host galaxy. The magnitudes of the targets at the time of the observations were also compared to their long-term light curves. Spectra from 24 objects display spectral features or a high S/N. From these, 12 spectroscopic redshifts were determined, ranging from 0.2223 to 0.7018. Furthermore, 1 tentative redshift (0.6622) and 2 redshift lower limits at z > 0.6185 and z > 0.6347 were obtained. The other 9 BL Lacs showed featureless spectra, despite the high S/N (> 100) observations. Our comparisons with long-term optical light curves tentatively suggest that redshift measurements are more straightforward during an optical low state of the AGN. Overall, we have determined 37 redshifts and 6 spectroscopic lower limits as part of our programme thus far.", "authors": "F. D'Ammando, P. Goldoni, W. Max-Moerbeck, J. Becerra Gonzalez, E. Kasai, D.

It is one of the rare examples of a high magnetic field pulsar showing characteristics both of magnetars and radio pulsars, and can thus provide important clues on the differences in the emission mechanisms between these two classes. In 2006, PSR J1846-0258 was detected to undergo an outburst for the first time, accompanied by a large flux increase, millisecond X-ray bursts, significant spectral changes and a large timing glitch. On August 1st 2020, after nineteen years of quiescent stable emission, the source underwent a second magnetar-like outburst, which was followed up with several observations by NICER, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Swift. In this work, we report on the long-term timing and X-ray spectral properties of the source following the 2020 outburst, and place upper limits on any radio activity. We demonstrate that the pulsed flux increased by a factor $> 6$ during the outburst, followed by non-trivial variability in the spin-down rate. Our timing analysis shows that the spin frequency and its derivative are clearly affected by magnetospheric activity due to the outburst.

{"title": "Type Ia Supernovae Can Arise from the Detonations of Both Stars in a Double Degenerate Binary", "abstract": "The precise origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is unknown despite their value to numerous areas in astronomy. While it is a long-standing consensus that they arise from an explosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the exact progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms that lead to SNe Ia are still debated. One popular theory is the double detonation in which a helium layer, accreted from a binary companion, detonates on the surface of the primary star, leading to a converging shock-induced detonation of the underlying core. It has recently been seen in simulations that a helium-rich degenerate companion may undergo its own explosion triggered by the impact from the ejecta of the primary star. We show 2D simulations that model a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation which triggers the explosion of the degenerate companion, leading to either a triple or quadruple detonation. We also present the first multi-dimensional radiative transfer results from the triple and quadruple detonation scenario. We find that within a range of mass configurations of the degenerate binary, the synthetic light curves and spectra of these events match observations as well as theoretical models of isolated double detonations do. Notably, double and quadruple detonations that are spectrally similar and reach the same peak brightnesses have drastically different ejection masses and produce different amounts of Si- and Fe-group elements. Further understanding of this scenario is needed in order to determine if at least some observed SNe Ia actually originate from two stars exploding.", "authors": "Samuel J. Boos, Dean M.

The results are interpreted and limitations, knowledge gaps and future prospects are discussed.

{"title": "Adaptive Neural-Operator Backstepping Control of a Benchmark Hyperbolic PDE", "abstract": "To stabilize PDEs, feedback controllers require gain kernel functions, which are themselves governed by PDEs. Furthermore, these gain-kernel PDEs depend on the PDE plants' functional coefficients. The functional coefficients in PDE plants are often unknown. This requires an adaptive approach to PDE control, i.e., an estimation of the plant coefficients conducted concurrently with control, where a separate PDE for the gain kernel must be solved at each timestep upon the update in the plant coefficient function estimate. Solving a PDE at each timestep is computationally expensive and a barrier to the implementation of real-time adaptive control of PDEs. Recently, results in neural operator (NO) approximations of functional mappings have been introduced into PDE control, for replacing the computation of the gain kernel with a neural network that is trained, once offline, and reused in real-time for rapid solution of the PDEs. In this paper, we present the first result on applying NOs in adaptive PDE control, presented for a benchmark 1-D hyperbolic PDE with recirculation. We establish global stabilization via Lyapunov analysis, in the plant and parameter error states, and also present an alternative approach, via passive identifiers, which avoids the strong assumptions on kernel differentiability. We then present numerical simulations demonstrating stability and observe speedups up to three orders of magnitude, highlighting the real-time efficacy of neural operators in adaptive control.

The source was found in the soft-intermediate state during these observations. We further studied the energy dependence of the QPO. We found that QPO was observed only for a higher energy range implying that the origin of QPO is possibly due to the corona emitting higher energy photons by the inverse Compton process. The variation of spectral parameters can be explained with the disk truncation model. The fractional rms found to be monotonically increased with energy.

In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We find that powerful and long-duration CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes ($\\sim 300-600$ kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass ($M_{\\rm vir}\\sim 8\\times 10^{12} - 8\\times 10^{13}~M_\\odot$) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.", "authors": "Yen-Hsing Lin, H.-Y. Karen Yang", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

Also, we searched for possible variations of the gamma-ray emission as a function of orbital phase for all the six MSPs in binary systems, but did not detect any significant modulations. The gamma-ray emission from the direction of M5 is well described by an exponentially cutoff power-law spectral model, although other models cannot be excluded. The phase-averaged emission is consistent with being steady on a time scale of a few months.

However, the measurement bias of voltage can highly deteriorate the estimation accuracy. One such example is the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery, which is highly prone to suffer from this issue owing to its flat open-circuit voltage curve. This work proposes a bias-compensated framework that reliably estimates the SOC and SOH of LFP batteries under the influence of voltage measurement bias. To validate the proposed approach, four LFP batteries are tested at various ambient temperatures and SOH conditions, with two different values of voltage measurement bias added. The results show that the bias-compensated algorithm achieves test errors that are less than 1.5% and 2% for SOC and SOH estimation, respectively.

Motivated by control of network systems with two levels of decision-making hierarchy, such as the management of energy networks and power coordination at cellular networks, a networked multi-leaders and multi-followers Stackelberg game is proposed. Due to the constraint of limited information interaction among players, a clustered information structure is assumed that each leader can only communicate with a portion of overall followers, namely its subordinated followers, and also only with its local neighboring leaders. In this case, the leaders cannot fully anticipate the collective rational response of all followers with its local information. To address Stackelberg equilibrium seeking under this partial information structure, we propose a distributed seeking algorithm based on implicit gradient estimation and network consensus mechanisms. We rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm for both diminishing and constant step sizes under strict and strong monotonicity conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the model and the algorithm can also incorporate linear equality and inequality constraints into the followers' optimization problems, with the approach of the interior point barrier function.

Due to ever rising spectrum demand, using dedicated frequency bands for terrestrial network (TN) and NTN may not be feasible. As a result, certain S-band frequency bands allocated by radio regulations to NTN networks are overlapping with those already utilized by cellular TN, leading to significant performance degradation due to the potential co-channel interference. Early simulation-based studies on different co-existence scenarios failed to offer a comprehensive and insightful understanding of these networks' overall performance. Besides, the complexity of a brute force performance evaluation increases exponentially with the number of nodes and their possible combinations in the network. In this paper, we utilize stochastic geometry to analytically derive the performance of TN-NTN integrated networks in terms of the probability of coverage and average achievable data rate for two co-existence scenarios. From the numerical results, it can be observed that, depending on the network parameters, TN and NTN users' distributions, and traffic load, one co-existence case may outperform the other, resulting in optimal performance of the integrated network.

{"title": "Dual-Loop Robust Control of Biased Koopman Operator Model by Noisy Data of Nonlinear Systems", "abstract": "The Koopman operator approach for data-driven control design of a nonlinear system is on the rise because of its capability to capture the behaviours of global dynamics. However, the measurement noises of inputs and outputs will bias the Koopman model identification and cause model mismatch from the actual nonlinear dynamics. The current work evaluates the bounds of the noise-induced model bias of the Koopman operator model and proposes a data-driven robust dual-loop control framework (Koopman based robust control-KROC) for the biased model. First, the model mismatch is found bounded under radial basis functions (RBF) and the bounded noises, and the bound of model mismatch is assessed. Second, the pitfalls of linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control based on the biased Koopman model of Van Der Pol oscillator are shown. Motivated from the pitfalls, the dual-loop control is proposed, which consist of an observer-based state-feedback control based on the nominal Koopman model and an additional robust loop to compensate model mismatch. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) is derived, which can guarantee robust stability and performance under bounded noises for the finite-dimensional Koopman operator model. Finally, the proposed framework is implemented to a nonlinear Van Der Pol oscillator to demonstrate enhanced control performance by the dual-loop robust control.", "authors": "Anuj Pal, Tianyi He, Xiang Chen", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Near- and sub-solar-mass naked singularities and black holes from transmutation of white dwarfs", "abstract": "Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.", "authors": "Chandrachur Chakraborty, Sudip Bhattacharyya", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Learning Stable Koopman Embeddings for Identification and Control", "abstract": "This paper introduces new model parameterizations for learning dynamical systems from data via the Koopman operator, and studies their properties. Whereas most existing works on Koopman learning do not take into account the stability or stabilizability of the model -- two fundamental pieces of prior knowledge about a given system to be identified -- in this paper, we propose new classes of Koopman models that have built-in guarantees of these properties. These models are guaranteed to be stable or stabilizable via a novel {\\em direct parameterization approach} that leads to {\\em unconstrained} optimization problems with respect to their parameter sets. To explore the representational flexibility of these model sets, we establish novel theoretical connections between the stability of discrete-time Koopman embedding and contraction-based forms of nonlinear stability and stabilizability. The proposed approach is illustrated in applications to stable nonlinear system identification and imitation learning via stabilizable models. Simulation results empirically show that the learning approaches based on the proposed models outperform prior methods lacking stability guarantees.", "authors": "Fletcher Fan, Bowen Yi, David Rye, Guodong Shi, Ian R.

{"title": "Shear oscillations in neutron stars and the nuclear symmetry energy", "abstract": "The shear and interface modes excited inside the neutron star due to the presence of elasticity depend on the properties of both the crust and core region. To examine how such eigenfrequencies depend on the neutron star properties, we solve the eigenvalue problem by adopting the relativistic Cowling approximation. Then, we confirm that the number of the interface modes excited in the star is generally equivalent to the number of the interface where the shear modulus discontinuously becomes zero, but we also find that the number of interface modes becomes smaller than that of the interface for the stellar model with lower or higher value of the slope parameter $L$. Furthermore, we derive the empirical relations for expressing the shear modes and one of the interface modes ($i_1$-mode in the text), which is the mode whose amplitude becomes dominant at the interface between the crust and envelopes and at the interface between the phases of slablike and cylindrical nuclei. At the end, we also show the possibility of identifying the higher QPO frequencies observed in GRB 200415A with the shear oscillations, as an alternative possibility instead of the torsional oscillations.", "authors": "Hajime Sotani", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Real-Time Dynamic Layout Optimization for Floating Offshore Wind Farm Control", "abstract": "Downstream wind turbines operating behind upstream turbines face significant performance challenges due to reduced wind speeds and increased turbulence. This leads to decreased wind energy production and higher dynamic loads on downwind turbines. Consequently, real-time monitoring and control have become crucial for improving wind farm performance. One promising solution involves optimizing wind farm layouts in real-time, taking advantage of the added flexibility offered by floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs). This study explores a dynamic layout optimization strategy to minimize wake effects in wind farms while meeting power requirements. Two scenarios are considered: power maximization and power set-point tracking. The methodology involves a centralized wind farm controller optimizing the layout, followed by wind turbine controllers to meet the prescribed targets. Each FOWT employs model predictive control to adjust aerodynamic thrust force. The control strategy integrates a dynamic wind farm model that considers floating platform motion and wake transport in changing wind conditions. In a case study with a 1x3 wind farm layout of 5 MW FOWTs, the results show a 25% increase in stable energy production compared to a static layout in one hour for the first scenario. In the second scenario, desired power production was swiftly and consistently achieved.", "authors": "Timothé Jard, Reda Snaiki", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

We use radio-to-VHE data from a multi-wavelength campaign organized between 2022-03-01 and 2022-07-19. The observations were performed by MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift (XRT and UVOT), and several instruments covering the optical and radio bands. During the IXPE pointings, the VHE state is close to the average behavior with a 0.2-1 TeV flux of 20%-50% the emission of the Crab Nebula. Despite the average VHE activity, an extreme X-ray behavior is measured for the first two IXPE pointings in March 2022 with a synchrotron peak frequency >1 keV. For the third IXPE pointing in July 2022, the synchrotron peak shifts towards lower energies and the optical/X-ray polarization degrees drop. The X-ray polarization is systematically higher than at lower energies, suggesting an energy-stratification of the jet. While during the IXPE epochs the polarization angle in the X-ray, optical and radio bands align well, we find a clear discrepancy in the optical and radio polarization angles in the middle of the campaign. We model the broad-band spectra simultaneous to the IXPE pointings assuming a compact zone dominating in the X-rays and VHE, and an extended zone stretching further downstream the jet dominating the emission at lower energies. NuSTAR data allow us to precisely constrain the synchrotron peak and therefore the underlying electron distribution. The change between the different states observed in the three IXPE pointings can be explained by a change of magnetization and/or emission region size, which directly connects the shift of the synchrotron peak to lower energies with the drop in polarization degree.", "authors": "S.

As an example, we calculate third post-Minkowskian (PM) order ($\\mathcal{O}(G^3)$), or two-loop, phase shifts for the scattering of a massless scalar field including all tidal effects and dissipation. Our calculation unveils two sources of the classical renormalization-group flow of dynamical Love numbers: a universal running independent of the nature of the compact object, and a running self-induced by tides. Restricting to the black hole case, we find that our EFT phase shifts agree exactly with those from general relativity, provided that the relevant static Love numbers are set to zero. In addition, we carry out a complete matching of the leading scalar dynamical Love number required to renormalize a universal short scale divergence in the S-wave.

In this study, we experimentally implement a model-based open-loop optimization scheme for optogenetic modulation of the expression of ATPase. Increasing the intracellular concentration of ATPase, and thus the level of ATP turnover, in bioprocesses with product synthesis coupled with ATP generation, can lead to increased product formation and substrate uptake. Previous simulation studies formulated optimal control problems using dynamic constraint-based models to find optimal light inputs in fermentations with optogenetically mediated ATPase expression. However, using these models poses challenges due to resulting bilevel optimizations and complex parameterization. Here, we outline a simplified unsegregated and quasi-unstructured kinetic modeling approach that reduces the number of dynamic states and leads to single-level optimizations. The models can be augmented with Gaussian processes to compensate for model uncertainties. We implement optimal control constrained by knowledge-based and hybrid models for optogenetic ATPase expression in $\\textit{Escherichia coli}$ with lactate as the main product. To do so, we genetically engineer $\\textit{E. coli}$ to obtain optogenetic expression of ATPase using the CcaS/CcaR system.

{"title": "An Integrated Imitation and Reinforcement Learning Methodology for Robust Agile Aircraft Control with Limited Pilot Demonstration Data", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a methodology for constructing data-driven maneuver generation models for agile aircraft that can generalize across a wide range of trim conditions and aircraft model parameters. Maneuver generation models play a crucial role in the testing and evaluation of aircraft prototypes, providing insights into the maneuverability and agility of the aircraft. However, constructing the models typically requires extensive amounts of real pilot data, which can be time-consuming and costly to obtain. Moreover, models built with limited data often struggle to generalize beyond the specific flight conditions covered in the original dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages a simulation model, referred to as the source model. This open-source agile aircraft simulator shares similar dynamics with the target aircraft and allows us to generate unlimited data for building a proxy maneuver generation model. We then fine-tune this model to the target aircraft using a limited amount of real pilot data. Our approach combines techniques from imitation learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning to achieve this objective. To validate our methodology, we utilize real agile pilot data provided by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). By employing the F-16 as the source model, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct a maneuver generation model that generalizes across various trim conditions and aircraft parameters without requiring any additional real pilot data.

We propose a poroelastic model for elastic deformation and liquid transport in three dimensional biofilms spreading on agar surfaces. The motion of the boundaries can be described by the combined use of Von Karman type approximations for the agar/biofilm interface and thin film approximations for the biofilm/air interface. Bacterial activity informs the macroscopic continuous model through source terms and residual stresses, either phenomenological or derived from microscopic models. We present a procedure to estimate the structure of such residual stresses, based on a simple cellular automata description of bacterial activity.

The aim of this study is to utilise ForbMod to develop a best-fit procedure to be applied on FR-related FDs as a convenient measurement tool. We develop a best-fit procedure that can be applied to a data series from an arbitrary detector. Thus, the basic procedure facilitates measurement estimation of the magnitude of the FR-related FD, with the possibility of being adapted for the energy response of a specific detector for a more advanced analysis. The non-linear fitting was performed by calculating all possible ForbMod curves constrained within the FR borders to the designated dataset and minimising the mean square error (MSE). In order to evaluate the performance of the ForbMod best-fit procedure, we used synthetic measurements produced by calculating the theoretical ForbMod curve for a specific example CME and then applying various effects to the data to mimic the imperfection of the real measurements. We also tested the ForbMod best-fit function on the real data, measured by detector F of the SOHO-EPHIN instrument on a sample containing 30 events, all of which have a distinct FD corresponding to the CMEs magnetic structure. Overall, we find that the ForbMod best-fit procedure performs similar to the traditional algorithm-based observational method, but with slightly smaller values for the FD amplitude, as it is taking into account the noise in the data. Furthermore, we find that the best-fit procedure has an advantage compared to the traditional method as it can estimate the FD amplitude even when there is a data gap at the onset of the FD.", "authors": "M.

{"title": "Uniform Recovery Guarantees for Quantized Corrupted Sensing Using Structured or Generative Priors", "abstract": "This paper studies quantized corrupted sensing where the measurements are contaminated by unknown corruption and then quantized by a dithered uniform quantizer. We establish uniform guarantees for Lasso that ensure the accurate recovery of all signals and corruptions using a single draw of the sub-Gaussian sensing matrix and uniform dither. For signal and corruption with structured priors (e.g., sparsity, low-rankness), our uniform error rate for constrained Lasso typically coincides with the non-uniform one [Sun, Cui and Liu, 2022] up to logarithmic factors. By contrast, our uniform error rate for unconstrained Lasso exhibits worse dependence on the structured parameters due to regularization parameters larger than the ones for non-uniform recovery. For signal and corruption living in the ranges of some Lipschitz continuous generative models (referred to as generative priors), we achieve uniform recovery via constrained Lasso with a measurement number proportional to the latent dimensions of the generative models. Our treatments to the two kinds of priors are (nearly) unified and share the common key ingredients of (global) quantized product embedding (QPE) property, which states that the dithered uniform quantization (universally) preserves inner product. As a by-product, our QPE result refines the one in [Xu and Jacques, 2020] under sub-Gaussian random matrix, and in this specific instance we are able to sharpen the uniform error decaying rate (for the projected-back projection estimator with signals in some convex symmetric set) presented therein from $O(m^{-1/16})$ to $O(m^{-1/8})$.", "authors": "Junren Chen, Zhaoqiang Liu, Meng Ding, Michael K.

{"title": "Type Ia supernovae from chemically segregated white dwarfs", "abstract": "Type Ia supernovae are the outcome of the explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. They are thought to be the main contributors to the galactic nucleosynthesis of iron-peak elements, with important contributions to the yields of intermediate mass elements. Recent analyses of the phase diagram of carbon and oxygen containing impurities such as $^{22}$Ne and $^{56}$Fe in conditions relevant to white dwarf interiors suggest that both isotopes can partially separate when the temperature of the star is low enough to start solidifying. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of such a segregation on the yields of the different chemical species synthesized during explosions. A one-dimensional supernova code has been used to evaluate the impact of the sedimentation assuming different degrees of chemical separation. It is found that the main properties of the ejecta, kinetic energy and ejected mass of $^{56}$Ni do only vary slightly when the separation is taken into account. However, the yields of important isotopes that are used as diagnostic tools such as manganese can be strongly modified. Furthermore, the chemical segregation studied here is able to change several indicators related to progenitor metallicity (such as the mass ratio of calcium to sulphur in the ejecta or the UV flux of the supernova) and to its mass, whether it is a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf or a substantially lighter one (such as the imprint of stable nickel on late-time infrared spectra or those related to the presence of radioactive nickel at the centre of the ejecta).", "authors": "E.

Most of these lack exact analytical solutions and are thus best tackled numerically.

It is shown by solving the distributionally sourced wave equation, which has analytical solutions, that numerical weak-form solutions can be recovered to high order accuracy by solving a first-order reduced system of ordinary differential equations. The method-of-lines framework is applied to the DiscoTEX algorithm i.e through discontinuous collocation with implicit-turned-explicit (IMTEX) integration methods which are symmetric and conserve symplectic structure. Furthermore, the main application of the algorithm is proved, for the first-time, by calculating the amplitude at any desired location within the numerical grid, including at the position (and at its right and left limit) where the wave- (or wave-like) equation is discontinuous via interpolation using DiscoTEX. This is shown, firstly by solving the wave- (or wave-like) equation and comparing the numerical weak-form solution to the exact solution. Finally, one shows how to reconstruct the scalar and gravitational metric perturbations from weak-form numerical solutions of a non-rotating black hole, which do not have known exact analytical solutions, and compare against state-of-the-art frequency domain results.

{"title": "Gravitational waves from axion domain walls in double level crossings", "abstract": "We investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves emitted by axion domain walls annihilation from the double level crossings. The double level crossings exists in the mass mixing between two axion fields, one of which is the $Z_{\\mathcal N}$ QCD axion. Here we consider a general mixing case that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the first level crossing, and the initial oscillation energy density should be large to climb over the barrier of potential. In this case, the axion dynamics has a chaotic run-away behavior, which is considered to be accompanied by domain walls formation. Then we investigate the gravitational waves emitted by axion domain walls annihilation, which is determined by their peak frequency and peak amplitude. Finally, we show the predicted nano-Hertz gravitational waves spectra from the double level crossings, which can be tested by the current and future pulsar timing array projects.", "authors": "Hai-Jun Li, Yu-Feng Zhou", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Specifically, unlike previous method such as CCS model, driver linear representation, waveform functional fitting or equivalent load capacitance, our algorithm does not rely on fixed reduced model of both standard cell driver and RC load. Instead, our algorithm approaches the current waveform dynamically by computing current responses of the target driver for various load scenarios. Besides, we creatively use symbolic expression to combine the y-parameter of RC network with the pre-characterized driver library in order to perform capacitance matching by considering over/under-shoot effect. Our algorithm is experimentally verified on 40nm CMOS technology and has been partially adopted by latest commercial tool for other nodes. Experimental results show that our algorithm has excellent resolution and promising efficiency compared with traditional methods and SPICE golden result, especially for application in computing delay, power and signal line electromigration.", "authors": "Zhoujie Wu, Cai Luo, Zhong Guan", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A Type II Singularity Avoidance Algorithm for Parallel Manipulators using Output Twist Screws", "abstract": "Parallel robots (PRs) are closed-chain manipulators with diverse applications due to their accuracy and high payload. However, there are configurations within the workspace named Type II singularities where the PRs lose control of the end-effector movements. Type II singularities are a problem for applications where complete control of the end-effector is essential. Trajectory planning produces accurate movements of a PR by avoiding Type II singularities. Generally, singularity avoidance is achieved by optimising a geometrical path with a velocity profile considering singular configurations as obstacles. This research presents an algorithm that avoids Type II singularities by modifying the trajectory of a subset of the actuators. The subset of actuators represents the limbs responsible for a Type II singularity, and they are identified by the angle between two Output Twist Screws. The proposed avoidance algorithm does not require optimisation procedures, which reduces the computational cost for offline trajectory planning and makes it suitable for online trajectory planning. The avoidance algorithm is implemented in offline trajectory planning for a pick and place planar PR and a spatial knee rehabilitation PR", "authors": "Jose L. Pulloquinga, Rafael J.

In this field, limiting the value of the force exerted on the patient is crucial, especially when an injured limb is involved. In human-robot interaction studies, the admittance controller modifies the location of the robot according to the user efforts driving the end-effector to an arbitrary location within the workspace. However, a parallel robot has singularities within the workspace, making implementing a conventional admittance controller unsafe. Thus, this study proposes an admittance controller that overcomes the limitations of singular configurations by using a real-time singularity avoidance algorithm. The singularity avoidance algorithm modifies the original trajectory based on the actual location of the parallel robot. The complemented admittance controller is applied to a 4 degrees of freedom parallel robot for knee rehabilitation. In this case, the actual location is measured by a 3D tracking system because the location calculated by the forward kinematics is inaccurate in the vicinity of a singularity. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed admittance controller for safe knee rehabilitation exercises", "authors": "Jose L. Pulloquinga, Rafael J.

We also provide a new characteristic function-based contrast function for ICA and propose a fixed point iteration to optimize the corresponding objective function. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to obtain sufficient conditions for the local and global optima of a family of contrast functions for ICA.

Here we present observations that include one of the earliest high-quality spectra and some of the earliest multi-colour photometry of a SN Ia to date. We calculated that SN 2020nlb faded 1.28+/-0.02 mag in the B band in the first 15d after maximum brightness. We independently fitted a power-law rise to the early flux in each filter, and found that the optical filters all give a consistent first light date estimate. In contrast to the earliest spectra of SN 2011fe, those of SN 2020nlb show strong absorption features from singly ionised metals, including Fe II and Ti II, indicating lower-excitation ejecta at the earliest times. The spectra of SN 2020nlb then evolve to become hotter and more similar to SN 2011fe as it brightens towards peak. We also obtained a sequence of nebular spectra that extend up to 594 days after maximum light, a phase out to which SNe Ia are rarely followed. The [Fe III]/[Fe II] flux ratio (as measured from emission lines in the optical spectra) begins to fall around 300 days after peak; by the +594d spectrum, the ionisation balance of the emitting region of the ejecta has shifted dramatically, with [Fe III] by then being completely absent. The final spectrum is almost identical to SN 2011fe at a similar epoch, and in sharp contrast to a late nebular spectrum of SN 1994D, which still displayed strong [Fe III] emission at these late times. Comparing our data to other SN Ia nebular spectra, there is a possible trend where SNe that were more luminous at peak tend to have a higher [Fe III]/[Fe II] flux ratio in the nebular phase, but there are also notable outliers.

We show that, under round-robin scheduling, in mmWave frequencies, the ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) of an OOB MO is monotonic in the total number of IRS elements with a pre-log factor that depends on the channel properties of the OOB UE. We further show that the maximum achievable SE of OOB MO scales log-linearly in IRS elements. Then, by specifying the minimum number of IRSs as a function of the channel parameters, we design a distributed IRS system in which an OOB MO almost surely obtains the maximum SE. Finally, we prove that the outage probability at an OOB UE decreases exponentially in the number of IRSs, even though they are randomly configured from the UE's viewpoint. We numerically verify our theory and conclude that distributed IRSs always help every MO, but the MO controlling the IRSs benefits the most.", "authors": "L. Yashvanth, Chandra R.

Due to their versatile and unique properties, smart lyogels exhibit great potential in various applications such as drug delivery or actuation processes. While Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM) is widely known as a thermo-responsive material, it also shows significant solvent-responsive swelling behavior. As polar solvents induce strong swelling due to hydrogen bonding with the amide group, nonpolar solvents lead to significant shrinkage of the lyogels. The aim of this study is to investigate and to model this behavior for future application in chemical or biochemical reactors. As a current area of research, incorporating smart hydrogel technology into (bio-)chemical reactors facilitates the development of smart reactor systems. Applying thermodynamic modelling with the gE model COSMO-RS on the monomer or oligomers of pNIPAM, the correlation between solvent-polymer interactions and the degree of swelling can be observed. pNIPAM derivatives exhibit low infinitive dilution activity coefficients (IDACs) in polar solvents with large degrees of swelling, while displaying an increase of IDACs in nonpolar solvents. Hydrogen bonds dominate the swelling behavior of lyogels not only in pure solvents but also in mixtures of solvents with varying polarity. Even in mixtures containing high amounts of nonpolar solvents, large degrees of swelling were observed due to the uptake of the polar solvent in the lyogel matrix. This effect can be observed in binary solvent mixtures but also in representative mixtures along an esterification reaction with varying carboxylic chain length of alcohol and carboxylic acids.", "authors": "Kathrin Marina Eckert, Simon Müller, Gerrit A.

Assuming a relativistic EoS, we calculate the power-law spectral index for different diffusion coefficients. With constant diffusion co-efficient and stiffer EoS, the observed range of the spectral index is very narrow; however, as the EoS becomes softer, the range increases. With varying diffusion co-efficient stiffer EoS fails to give a well-defined spectral index (no linear spectrum); however, as the EoS becomes softer, the spectral index lies between $2-4$.

{"title": "Predicting heteropolymer interactions: demixing and hypermixing of disordered protein sequences", "abstract": "Cells contain multiple condensates which spontaneously form due to the heterotypic interactions between their components. Although the proteins and disordered region sequences that are responsible for condensate formation have been extensively studied, the rule of interactions between the components that allow demixing, i.e., the coexistence of multiple condensates, is yet to be elucidated. Here we construct an effective theory of the interaction between heteropolymers by fitting it to the molecular dynamics simulation results obtained for more than 200 sequences sampled from the disordered regions of human proteins. We find that the sum of amino acid pair interactions across two heteropolymers predicts the Boyle temperature qualitatively well, which can be quantitatively improved by the dimer pair approximation, where we incorporate the effect of neighboring amino acids in the sequences. The improved theory, combined with the finding of a metric that captures the effective interaction strength between distinct sequences, allowed the selection of up to three disordered region sequences that demix with each other in multicomponent simulations, as well as the generation of artificial sequences that demix with a given sequence. The theory points to a generic sequence design strategy to demix or hypermix thanks to the low dimensional nature of the space of the interactions that we identify. As a consequence of the geometric arguments in the space of interactions, we find that the number of distinct sequences that can demix with each other is strongly constrained, irrespective of the choice of the coarse-grained model. Altogether, we construct a theoretical basis for methods to estimate the effective interaction between heteropolymers, which can be utilized in predicting phase separation properties as well as rules of assignment in the localization and functions of disordered proteins.", "authors": "Kyosuke Adachi, Kyogo Kawaguchi", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},

We propose a strategy that takes a common (non-bistable) metamaterial design and transforms it into a bistable one, specifically, by allowing for irregular patterns through geometric perturbations of the unit cell and by leveraging the intercell constraints inherent to the large deformation response of metamaterials. We exemplify this strategy by producing a design framework for bistable planar kirigami metamaterials starting from the canonical rotating-squares pattern. The framework comprises explicit design formulas for cell-based kirigami with unprecedented control over the shape of the two stable states, and an optimization methodology that allows for efficient tailoring of the geometric features of the designs to achieve target elastic properties as well as shape change. The versatility of this framework is illustrated through a wide variety of examples, including non-periodic designs that achieve two arbitrarily-shaped stable states. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, featuring prototypes with distinct engineering design details, complement the theory and shine light on the strengths and limitations of our design approach. These results show how to design bistable metamaterials from non-bistable templates, paving the way for further discovery of bistable systems and structures that are not simply arrangements of known bistable units.", "authors": "Yingchao Peng, Imtiar Niloy, Megan Kam, Paolo Celli, Paul Plucinsky", "date": "15 Jan 2024 ("},
{"title": "Combined magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores and crusts: Ambipolar diffusion, Hall effect and Ohmic dissipation", "abstract": "Neutron star magnetic field evolution is mediated through the Hall effect and Ohmic dissipation in the crust while ambipolar diffusion is taking place in the core. These effects have been studied in detail in either part of the star, however, their combined, simultaneous evolution and interplay has not been explored in detail yet. Here, we present simulation results of the simultaneous evolution of the magnetic field in the core due to ambipolar diffusion and the crust due to Hall effect and Ohmic decay, under the assumption of axial symmetry. We find that a purely poloidal field generates a toroidal field in the crust, due to the Hall effect, that sinks into the core. A purely toroidal field remains toroidal and spreads into the core and the crust. Finally, for a mixed poloidal-toroidal field, the north-south symmetry is broken due to the Hall effect in the crust, however, ambipolar diffusion, tends to restore it. We examine the role of ambipolar diffusion to the magnetic field decay and we compare the rate of the conversion of magnetic field energy into heat, finding that it enhances the magnetic field decay in neutron stars.", "authors": "Dimitrios Skiathas, Konstantinos N.

In this paper, we investigate the influence of stellar rotation on binary systems consisting of a 30 solar mass donor star and a 20 solar mass accretor using the MESA stellar evolution code. We find that through mass transfer in binary systems, fast-rotating red- and blue-supergiant progenitors can be formed within a certain range of initial orbital periods, albeit the correlation is not linear. We also find that even with the same initial mass ratio of the binary system, the resulting final masses of the collapsars, the iron core masses, the compactness parameters, and the final rotational rates can vary widely and are sensitive to the initial orbital periods. For instance, the progenitors with strong convection form a thinner Si-shell and a wider O-shell compared to those in single-star systems. In addition, we conduct two-dimensional self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations with neutrino transport for these rotating progenitors derived from binary stellar evolution. We find that the neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures of these binary progenitors could exhibit significant variations. Progenitors with larger compactness parameters produce more massive proto-neutron stars, have higher mass-accretion rates, and emit brighter neutrino luminosity and louder gravitational emissions.

Then, entropy measures and embedding parameters have been extracted. These features have been investigated individually to find the most discriminating ones. The significance level of each feature was evaluated by statistical analysis. Consequently, LDA and SVM algorithms have been employed to categorize the EEG signals.

In this work, we consider the collective excitations of active systems at high density, focusing on a one-dimensional chain of elastically coupled inertial particles, whose activity is modeled with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Their excitation spectrum shows the presence of two kinds of fluctuations: the first ones are thermally excited phonons analogous to those of a passive crystal while the second ones have been termed entropons because associated with the entropy production due to the active forces. These two types of fluctuations show different properties: in fact, only entropons generate spatial velocity correlations and fail to satisfy a standard fluctuation-response relation. We derive the exact expression for the equal-time velocity and displacement correlations as well as for the structure factor and in each case identify the phonon and entropon contributions. Finally, we investigate the dynamical properties of the excitations in terms of steady-state two-time correlations, such as the intermediate scattering function and the mean-square displacement, and show that both phonon and entropon fluctuations are characterized by a long wavelength overdamped regime and a short wavelength underdamped regime. In the large persistence case, entropons decay slower than phonons, and in general, activity tends to suppress the oscillations typical of the underdamped regime.", "authors": "Umberto Marini Bettolo Marconi, Hartmut Löwen, Lorenzo Caprini", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},

We consider redundant array configurations (with repeated virtual transmit-receive sensors), which we have recently shown to be able to achieve their maximal identifiability while transmitting fewer independent waveforms than transmitters. Reducing waveform rank in this manner can be beneficial in various ways. For example, it may free up spatial resources for transmit beamforming. In this paper, we show that two array geometries with identical sum co-arrays, and the same number of physical and virtual sensors, need not achieve equal identifiability, regardless of the choice of waveform of a fixed reduced rank. This surprising result establishes the important role the pattern (not just the number) of repeated virtual sensors has in governing identifiability, and reveals the limits of compensating for unfavorable array geometries via waveform design.", "authors": "Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal", "date": "13 Jan 2024"},

However, none of the studies have considered liquid-liquid moving contact lines and the present study fills this vital gap. Using particle image velocimetry, we simultaneously measure the velocity field in both the liquid phases using refractive index matching techniques. The flow field obtained from experiments in both phases is directly compared against theoretical models. Measurement of interface speed reveals that material points rapidly slow down as the contact line is approached. Further, the experiments also reveal the presence of slip along the moving wall in the vicinity of the contact line suggesting a clear mechanism for how the singularity is arrested at the contact line.", "authors": "Charul Gupta, Lakshmana D Chandrala, Harish N Dixit", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

We recently discovered that a suspension of photophobic algae can be unstable, occasioning a complete phase separation of the system with the emergence of an active liquid phase. Indeed here small spatial fluctuations in cell density influence the phototactic behavior of surrounding cells which tend to join and therefore amplify the fluctuations. In a cylindrical geometry, this strong coupling between cell density and light fields through both negative phototaxis and light absorption by the individual cells led to the emergence of dynamic branching patterns whose features depend on the global cell density, light intensity and medium viscosity. We developed a simple model based on a drift-diffusion framework that finely reproduces the experimental data on the destabilization. We finally showed that this active phase separation efficiently protects the individual cells against the negative effects of light on the integrity of the photosynthetic machinery (photoinhibition of Photosystem II), demonstrating that on short timescales phototaxis efficiently contributes to photoprotection through collective behaviors at the population level.", "authors": "Eisenmann Isabelle, L'Homme Alfredo, Lahlou Aliénor, Bujaldon Sandrine, Le Saux Thomas, Bailleul Benjamin, Desprat Nicolas, Jeanneret Raphaël", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

However, when multiple human individuals are present, their reflected signals could be intertwined in the time, frequency and spatial domains, making it challenging to separate them. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel system for multiperson detection and monitoring of vital signs (i.e., respiration and heartbeat) with the assistance of space-time-coding (STC) reconfigurable intelligent metasurfaces (RISs). Specifically, the proposed system scans the area of interest (AoI) for human detection by using the harmonic beams generated by the STC RIS. Simultaneously, frequencyorthogonal beams are assigned to each detected person for accurate estimation of their respiration rate (RR) and heartbeat rate (HR). Furthermore, to efficiently extract the respiration signal and the much weaker heartbeat signal, we propose an improved variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm to accurately decompose the complex reflected signals into a smaller number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We build a prototype to validate the proposed multiperson detection and vital-sign monitoring system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can simultaneously monitor the vital signs of up to four persons. The errors of RR and HR estimation using the improved VMD algorithm are below 1 RPM (respiration per minute) and 5 BPM (beats per minute), respectively. Further analysis reveals that the flexible beam controlling mechanism empowered by the STC RIS can reduce the noise reflected from other irrelative objects on the physical layer, and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of echoes from the human chest.", "authors": "Xinyu Li, Jian Wei You, Ze Gu, Qian Ma, Jingyuan Zhang, Long Chen, Tie Jun Cui", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},

An emerging approach to accomplish these goals is the design of new waveforms, which draw from the inherent relationship between the doubly-dispersive nature of time-variant (TV) channels and the environmental features of scatterers manifested in the form of multi-path delays and Doppler shifts. Examples of such waveforms are the delay-Doppler domain orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and the recently proposed chirp domain affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), both of which seek to simultaneously combat the detrimental effects of double selectivity and exploit them for the estimation (or sensing) of environmental information. This article aims to provide a consolidated and comprehensive overview of the signal processing techniques required to support reliable ISAC over doubly-dispersive channels in beyond fifth generation (B5G)/sixth generation (6G) systems, with an emphasis on OTFS and AFDM waveforms, as those, together with the traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, suffice to elaborate on the most relevant properties of the trend. The analysis shows that OTFS and AFDM indeed enable significantly improved robustness against inter-carrier interference (ICI) arising from Doppler shifts compared to OFDM.

To address this limitation, this work builds upon the intuition that the temporal pattern of changes in RSS features can be used to detect the presence of concurrent transmissions from multiple (possibly changing) locations, which in turn indicates the existence of an attack. Since a localization-based approach would require costly data collection and would suffer from low spatial resolution due to multipath, the proposed algorithm employs a deep neural network to construct a graph embedding of a sequence of RSS features that reflects changes in the propagation conditions. A graph neural network then classifies these embeddings to detect spoofing attacks. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme are corroborated by experiments with real-data.", "authors": "Tien Ngoc Ha, Daniel Romero", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Privacy Analysis of Affine Transformations in Cloud-based MPC: Vulnerability to Side-knowledge", "abstract": "Search for the optimizer in computationally demanding model predictive control (MPC) setups can be facilitated by Cloud as a service provider in cyber-physical systems. This advantage introduces the risk that Cloud can obtain unauthorized access to the privacy-sensitive parameters of the system and cost function. To solve this issue, i.e., preventing Cloud from accessing the parameters while benefiting from Cloud computation, random affine transformations provide an exact yet light weight in computation solution. This research deals with analyzing privacy preserving properties of these transformations when they are adopted for MPC problems. We consider two common strategies for outsourcing the optimization required in MPC problems, namely separate and dense forms, and establish that random affine transformations utilized in these forms are vulnerable to side-knowledge from Cloud. Specifically, we prove that the privacy guarantees of these methods and their extensions for separate form are undermined when a mild side-knowledge about the problem in terms of structure of MPC cost function is available. In addition, while we prove that outsourcing the MPC problem in the dense form inherently leads to some degree of privacy for the system and cost function parameters, we also establish that affine transformations applied to this form are nevertheless prone to be undermined by a Cloud with mild side-knowledge.

{"title": "Secure Dynamic Event-triggered Consensus Under Asynchronous Denial of Service", "abstract": "This article proposes a secure implementation for consensus using a dynamic event-triggered (DET) communication scheme in high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) under asynchronous (distributed) denial of service (DoS) attacks. By introducing a linear auxiliary trajectory of the system, the DET data transmission scheme among the neighboring agents is employed to reduce the communication for each agent. The asynchronous DoS attacks can block each communication channel among the cooperative agents independently in an unknown pattern. To guarantee state consensus of auxiliary MAS under DoS, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based optimization approach is proposed which simultaneously designs all the unknown DET communication parameters as well as the state feedback control gain. In addition to asynchronous DoS attacks over the graph topology, the destructive effects of independent DoS attacks over the communication links between actual and auxiliary states are compensated as an additional layer of resiliency for the system. The output of each agent ultimately tracks the auxiliary state of the system and this results in the output consensus.", "authors": "Ali Azarbahram, Amir Amini", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

Wind power is converted into electricity with a feedback controlled periodic trajectory of the kite and corresponding reeling motion of the tether. An analysis of the mutual influence between the platform and the kite dynamics, with different wave regimes, reveals a rather small sensitivity of the flight pattern to the platform oscillations; on the other hand, the frequency of tether force oscillations can be close to the platform resonance peaks, resulting in possible increased fatigue loads and damage of the floating and submerged components.

Recent advances have led to the use of critical Casimir forces as a powerful tool, which can be finely tuned through the temperature of the environment and the chemical properties of the involved objects. For example, these forces have been used to self-organize ensembles of particles and to counteract stiction caused by Casimir-Liftshitz forces. However, until now, the potential of critical Casimir torques has been largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that critical Casimir torques can efficiently control the alignment of microscopic objects on nanopatterned substrates. We show experimentally and corroborate with theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations that circular patterns on a substrate can stabilize the position and orientation of microscopic disks. By making the patterns elliptical, such microdisks can be subject to a torque which flips them upright while simultaneously allowing for more accurate control of the microdisk position. More complex patterns can selectively trap 2D-chiral particles and generate particle motion similar to non-equilibrium Brownian ratchets.

As the first generation of AVs, adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are vulnerable to cyberattacks. While recent effort has been made to understanding the impact of attacks on transportation systems, little work has been done to systematically model and characterize the malicious nature of candidate attacks. In this study, we develop a general framework for modeling and synthesizing two types of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles, namely direct attacks on vehicle control commands and false data injection attacks on sensor measurement, with explicit characterization of their adverse effects. Based on linear stability analysis of car-following dynamics, we derive a series of analytical conditions characterizing the malicious nature of potential attacks. This ensures a higher degree of realism in modeling attacks with adverse effects, as opposed to simply considering attacks as constants or random variables. Notably, the conditions derived provide an effective method for strategically synthesizing an array of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles. We conduct extensive simulation to examine the impacts of intelligently designed attacks on microscopic car-following dynamics and macroscopic traffic flow. Numerical results illustrate the mechanism of candidate attacks, offering useful insights into understanding the vulnerability of future transportation systems.

Yet, there is no comprehensive understanding of how crowding affects reactions, particularly multivalent binding. Herein, we use scaled particle theory and develop a molecular simulation method to investigate the binding of monovalent to divalent biomolecules. We find that crowding can increase or reduce cooperativity--the extent to which the binding of a second molecule is enhanced after binding a first molecule--by orders of magnitude, depending on the sizes of the involved molecular complexes. Cooperativity generally increases when a divalent molecule swells and then shrinks upon binding two ligands. Our calculations also reveal that, in some cases, crowding enables binding that does not occur otherwise. As an immunological example, we consider Immunoglobulin G-antigen binding and show that crowding enhances its cooperativity in bulk but reduces it when an Immunoglobulin G binds antigens on a surface.", "authors": "Tomasz Skóra, Mathijs Janssen, Andreas Carlson, Svyatoslav Kondrat", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

The latter typically nonuniversally slows down motion near the solid-liquid interface as modeled via modification of the surface dynamic free energy caging constraints which are spatially transferred into the film, and which compete with the accelerated relaxation gradient induced by the vapor interface. Quantitative applications to the foundational hard sphere fluid and a polymer melt are presented. The strength of the effective fluid-substrate coupling has very large consequences on the dynamical gradients and film-averaged quantities in a film thickness and thermodynamic state dependent manner. The interference of the dynamical gradients of opposite nature emanating from the vapor and solid interfaces is determined, including the conditions for the disappearance of a bulk-like region in the film center. The relative importance of surface-induced modification of local caging versus the generic truncation of the long range collective elastic component of the activation barrier is studied. The conditions for the accuracy and failure of a simple superposition approximation for dynamical gradients in thin films is also determined. The emergence of near substrate dead layers, large gradient effects on film-averaged response functions, and a weak non-monotonic evolution of dynamic gradients in thick and cold films, are briefly discussed.

As a non-contact alignment strategy with a controllability of orientation, magnetic-field alignment has been rarely adapted in 4D printing of LCE because of its poor printing efficiency and demand on large field strength. Here, we report a digital light projection (DLP) system integrated with reorientable magnetic field to facilely print smart LCE structures. We propose a new LCE precursor solution that maintains a liquid crystalline nematic phase and an adequate flowability at room temperature.

Consequential printed structures are capable of presenting an impressive reversible thermal actuation of more than 30 %.

As a test case, Langmuir-Blodgett $Mn_{12}$-ac SMM films have been grown on 2 $\\mu$m wide Nb tracks and Nb nano-SQUIDs to observe the proximity effect of magnetic moment and magnetization tunneling, respectively. The superconducting critical temperature of thin Nb tracks (thinner than the coherence length of Nb) were found to decrease by the magnetic moment of $Mn_{12}$-ac SMM. Following the thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) model, we found an increase in the vortex unbinding energy of the SMM coated Nb tracks, near critical temperature. More importantly, the random alignment of moments of the $Mn_{12}$-ac molecules at low fields seemed to have the enhancing effect on vortex unbinding energy rather than the saturated state of $Mn_{12}$-ac molecules at high fields. In the fully superconducting state, on the other hand, the vortex pinning effects were found to be more effective in the saturated state of the $Mn_{12}$-ac molecules, as seen from magnetoresistance and field dependent critical current measurements. In a separate experiment, a Langmuir-Blodgett film of SMM was grown on a nano-SQUID to look for local changes in magnetization arising from magnetizatin tunnelling phenomenon in SMMs. Upon magnetizing the SMM (deposited on SQUIDs) at 2 K along the plane of the film and allowing it to relax, we found occasional jumps in the underlying SQUID voltage, unlike bare nano-SQUIDs, which did not show any such jumps over several hours. Therefore, we believe that the jumps in the SQUID voltage are the signatures of random tunneling of magnetization in the SMM layer.", "authors": "Bibekananda Das, Tapas Senapati, Malaya K.

If the wrong angles are enforced, the branches coalesce to a linear structure, a pure tube. After releasing the mechanical force, Y-branched structures remain metastable if one constrains the enclosed volume and the average curvature (the area difference) to a fixed value; tetrahedral junctions however split up into two Y-junctions. Somewhat counterintuitively, the energy cost of adding a Y-branch is negative in structures with fixed surface area and tube diameter, even if one accounts for the positive contribution of the additional branch end. For fixed average curvature, however, adding a branch also enforces a thinning of tubes, therefore the overall curvature energy cost is positive.

In this work, we provide the first example of a circuit which is composed of a simulable gate set, yet has a Wigner-Dyson distributed entanglement level spectrum without any perturbing universal element.

We then examine the entanglement spectrum of matchgate circuits with varied input states, and find a sharp jump in the complexity of entanglement as we go from two- to three-qubit entangled inputs. Studying Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits, we find examples of classically simulable circuits whose output states exhibit Wigner-Dyson entanglement level statistics in the absence of universal quantum gate elements.

The 2020-2021 event was caused by a cloud with column density near 1e22 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.6. The cloud in the 2022 event had a column density near 3e23 /cm2 and a covering fraction near 0.8. The optical/UV continuum flux varied minimally and the optical emission line spectra showed no variability in Balmer profiles or intensity. The transiting gas clouds are neutral or lowly-ionized, while the lower limits on their radial distances are commensurate with the dust sublimation zone (cloud 1) or the optical broad line region (cloud 2). One possible explanation is a dust-free, outflowing wind with embedded X-ray clumps. These events are the first cloud obscuration events detected in a Seyfert galaxy using eROSITA's X-ray monitoring capabilities.", "authors": "Alex Markowitz, Mirko Krumpe, David Homan, Mariusz Gromadzki, Malte Schramm, Thomas Boller, Saikruba Krishnan, Tathagata Saha, Joern Wilms, Andrea Gokus, Steven Haemmerich, Hartmut Winkler, Johannes Buchner, David A.

{"title": "Constraints on the densities and temperature of Seyfert 2 NLR", "abstract": "Different studies have reported the so-called temperature problem of the narrow line region (NLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Its origin is still an open issue. To properly address its cause, a trustworthy temperature indicator is required. We propose that the weak [ArIV] 4711,40A doublet is the appropriate tool for evaluating the density of the high excitation plasma. We subsequently made use of the recent S7 survey sample to extract reliable measurements of the weak [ArIV] doublet in 16 high excitation Seyfert 2s. As a result we could derive the plasma density of the NLR of our Seyfert 2 sample and compare the temperature inferred from the observed [OIII] (4363A/5007A) ratios. It was found that 13 Seyfert 2s cluster near similar values as the [OIII] (4363A/5007A) ratio, at a mean value of 0.0146+-0.0020. Three objects labeled outliers stand out at markedly higher [OIII] values (> 0.03). If for each object one assumes a single density, the values inferred from the [ArIV] doublet for the 13 clustering objects all lie below 60,000 cm-3, indicating that the [OIII] (4363A/5007A) ratios in these objects is a valid tracer of plasma temperature. Even when assuming a continuous power-law distribution of the density, the inferred cut-off density required to reproduce the observed [ArIV] doublet is in all cases < 1E5.1 cm-3. The average NLR temperature inferred for the 13 Seyfert 2s is 13,000+-703 K, which photoionization models have difficulty reproducing. Subsequently we considered different mechanisms to account for the observed [OIII] ratios. For the three outliers, a double-bump density distribution is likely required, with the densest component having a density > 1E6 cm-3.", "authors": "Luc Binette, Henry R. M.

In contrast with the case of a permanent target, the capture probability and the conditional mean first passage time can be optimized. The optimal Lévy index takes a non-trivial value, even in the long lifetime limit, and exhibits an abrupt transition as the initial distance to the target is varied. Depending on the target lifetime, this transition is discontinuous or continuous, separated by a non-conventional tricritical point.

However, it has been shown that the standard one-zone model cannot produce sufficiently high neutrino flux due to constraints from the X-ray data, implying more complex properties of the radiation zones in the blazar than that described by the standard one-zone model. In this work we investigate multi-epoch high-energy muon neutrino events associated with the blazar $TXS~0506+056$ occured in 2014-2015, 2017-2018, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, respectively. We applied the so-called ``stochastic dissipation model'' to account for the neutrino-blazar associations detected in the four epochs simultaenously. This model describes a scenario in which the emission of the blazar arise from the superimposition of two components: a persistent component related to the quasi-stable state of the blazar and a transient component responsible for the sudden enhancement of the blazar's flux, either in electromagnetic radiation or in neutrino emission. The latter component could form at a random distance along the jet by a strong energy dissipation event. Under such assumption, the multi-epoch broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) can be well explained and the expected number of high-energy neutrino events is statistically realistic. The expected number of neutrino events in half-year is around 8.2, 0.07, 0.73 and 0.41, corresponding to the epoch in 2014-2015, 2017-2018, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, respectively.

{"title": "Optimal encoding of two dissipative interacting qubits", "abstract": "We investigate a system of two coupled qubits interacting with an Ohmic bath as a physical model for the implementation of one logical qubit. In this model, the interaction with the other qubit represents unitary noise while the Ohmic bath is responsible for finite temperature. In the presence of a one-dimensional decoherence-free subspace (DFS), we show that, while this is not sufficient to protect a qubit from decoherence, it can be exploited to encode one logical qubit with greater performance than the physical one. We show different possible strategies for the optimal encoding of a logical qubit through a numerical analysis based on matrix product states. This method reproduces faithfully the results of perturbative calculations, but it can be extended to cases of crucial interest for physical implementations, e.g., in the case of strong coupling with the bath. As a result, a logical qubit encoded in the subspace which is the direct sum of the antiferromagnetic states in Bell basis, the DFS and the one in the triplet, is the optimally robust one, as it takes advantage of both the anchoring to the DFS and the protection from the antiferromagnetic interaction.

We examine the central clumps within a sample of seven infrared-dark clouds (IRDCs) with a range of masses and morphologies. We use 1 pc-scale observations from NOEMA and the IRAM 30-m telescope to trace dense cores with 2.8 mm continuum, and gas kinematics in C$^{18}$O, HCO$^+$, HNC, and N$_2$H$^+$ ($J$=1$-$0). We supplement our continuum sample with six IRDCs observed at 2.9 mm with ALMA, and examine the relationships between core- and clump-scale properties. We have developed a fully-automated multiple-velocity component hyperfine line-fitting code called mwydyn which we employ to trace the dense gas kinematics in N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0), revealing highly complex and dynamic clump interiors. We find that parsec-scale clump mass is the most important factor driving the evolution; more massive clumps are able to concentrate more mass into their most massive cores - with a log-normally distributed efficiency of around 9% - in addition to containing the most dynamic gas. Distributions of linewidths within the most massive cores are similar to the ambient gas, suggesting that they are not dynamically decoupled, but are similarly chaotic. A number of studies have previously suggested that clumps are globally collapsing; in such a scenario, the observed kinematics of clump centres would be the direct result of gravity-driven mass inflows that become ever more complex as the clumps evolve, which in turn leads to the chaotic mass growth of their core populations.", "authors": "Andrew J.

Those are injected into Gaussian noise given by the sensitivity of the third-generation detector Einstein Telescope and reconstructed using BayesWave, a Bayesian data-analysis algorithm that recovers the signals through a model-agnostic approach. The two representations of thermal effects result in frequency shifts of the dominant peaks in the spectra of the post-merger signals, for both the quadrupole fundamental mode and the late-time inertial modes.

To bridge this capability gap, we propose a novel approach exploiting the rich mathematical theory of simplicial complexes (SCs) - a robust tool for modeling higher-order interactions. Current SC-based GNNs are burdened by high complexity and rigidity, and quantifying higher-order interaction strengths remains challenging. Innovatively, we present a higher-order Flower-Petals (FP) model, incorporating FP Laplacians into SCs. Further, we introduce a Higher-order Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) grounded in FP Laplacians, capable of discerning intrinsic features across varying topological scales. By employing learnable graph filters, a parameter group within each FP Laplacian domain, we can identify diverse patterns where the filters' weights serve as a quantifiable measure of higher-order interaction strengths. The theoretical underpinnings of HiGCN's advanced expressiveness are rigorously demonstrated. Additionally, our empirical investigations reveal that the proposed model accomplishes state-of-the-art performance on a range of graph tasks and provides a scalable and flexible solution to explore higher-order interactions in graphs.

{"title": "Three-body encounters in black hole discs around a supermassive black hole: The disc velocity dispersion and the Keplerian tidal field determine the eccentricity and spin-orbit alignment of gravitational wave mergers", "abstract": "Dynamical encounters of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in a disc of compact objects around a supermassive BH (SMBH) can accelerate the formation and coalescence of BH binaries. It has been proposed that binary-single encounters among BHs in such discs can lead to an excess of highly-eccentric BH mergers. However, previous studies have neglected how the disc velocity dispersion and the SMBH's tidal field affect the 3-body dynamics. We investigate the outcomes of binary-single encounters considering different values of the disc velocity dispersion, and examine the role of the SMBH's tidal field. We then demonstrate how their inclusion affects the properties of merging BH binaries. We perform simulations of 4-body encounters (i.e. with the SMBH as fourth particle) using the highly-accurate, regularized code TSUNAMI, which includes post-Newtonian corrections up to order 3.5PN. The disc velocity dispersion controls how orbits in the disc are aligned and circular, and determines the relative velocity of the binary-single pair before the encounter. As the velocity dispersion decreases, the eccentricity of post-encounter binaries transitions from thermal to superthermal, and binaries experience enhanced hardening. The transition between these two regimes happens at disc eccentricities and inclinations of order e ~ i ~ 10^-4. These distinct regimes correspond to a disc dominated by random motions, and one dominated by the Keplerian shear. The inclusion of the SMBH's tidal field and the disc velocity dispersion can significantly affect the number of GW mergers, and especially the number of highly-eccentric inspirals. These can be up to ~2 times higher at low velocity dispersion, and ~12 times lower at high velocity dispersions. The spin-orbit alignment is influenced by the tidal field exclusively at high velocity dispersions, effectively inhibiting the formation of anti-aligned binary BHs.", "authors": "Alessandro Alberto Trani, Stefano Quaini, Monica Colpi", "date": "20 Dec 2023 ("},

On the critical line of confinement versus noise, swarms are in a state of scale-free chaos characterized by minimal correlation time, correlation length proportional to swarm size and topological data analysis. The critical line separates dispersed single clusters from confined multicluster swarms. Scale-free chaotic swarms occupy a compact region of space and comprise a recognizable `condensed' nucleus and particles leaving and entering it. Susceptibility, correlation length, dynamic correlation function and largest Lyapunov exponent obey power laws.

Measured static and dynamic critical exponents differ from those of equilibrium and many nonequilibrium phase transitions.

(ii) As alignment noise vanishes, there are power laws connecting critical confinement and noise that allow calculating static critical exponents for fixed $N$. These power laws imply that the unmeasurable confinement strength is proportional to the perception range measured in natural swarms. (iii) Observations of natural swarms occur at different times and under different atmospheric conditions, which we mimic by considering mixtures of data on different critical lines and $N$.

Chiral $p_x+ip_y$ and $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ states respond to such perturbations in ways that may help to distinguish them from other superconducting pairings. However, past experimental efforts along this line, using uniaxial strains and magnetic fields parallel to the RuO$_2$ plane, have not been able to reach an unambiguous conclusion. In this study, we propose to further examine the possibility of chiral superconducting order in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using an alternative tetragonal-symmetry-breaking perturbation -- in-plane supercurrent. We study the superconducting phase diagram as a function of both temperature and the applied supercurrent. Supercurrent generically splits the transition of the two chiral order parameter components, and we show that the splitting can give rise to visible specific heat anomalies. Furthermore, supercurrent parallel and anti-parallel to the unidirectional propagation of the chiral edge modes impact the edge states in different manner. This difference manifests in the tunneling spectrum, thereby providing an additional means to probe the chirality even when the related spontaneous edge current is vanishingly small. Finally, we discuss the distinction of supercurrent responses in non-chiral time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting states.

Our findings unveil an interplay between precession and eccentricity: the spins of eccentric binaries precess on shorter timescales and their nutation amplitude is altered compared to black holes on quasi-circular orbits, consequently affecting the so-called spin morphology. Even if binaries circularize by the time they enter the sensitivity window of our detectors, their spin orientations retain some memory of the past evolution on eccentric orbits, thus providing a new link between gravitational-wave detection and astrophysical formation. At the same time, we point out that residual eccentricity should be considered a source of systematics when reconstructing the past history of black-hole binaries using the spin orientations.", "authors": "Giulia Fumagalli, Davide Gerosa", "date": "25 Oct 2023 ("},
{"title": "Critical phase induced by Berry phase and dissipation in a spin chain", "abstract": "Motivated by experiments on spin chains embedded in a metallic bath, as well as closed quantum systems described by long-range interacting Hamiltonians, we study a critical SU(N) spin chain perturbed by dissipation, or equivalently, after space-time rotation, long-range spatial interactions. The interplay of dissipation and the Wess-Zumino (Berry phase) term results in a rich phase diagram with multiple renormalization-group fixed points. For a range of the exponent that characterizes the dissipative bath, we find a second-order phase transition between the fixed point that describes an isolated critical spin chain and a dissipation-induced-ordered phase. More interestingly, for a different range of the exponent, we find a stable, gapless, nonrelativistic phase of matter whose existence necessarily requires coupling to the dissipative bath. Upon tuning the exponent, we find that the fixed point corresponding to this gapless, stable phase \"annihilates\" the fixed point that describes the transition out of this phase to the ordered phase. We also study a relativistic version of our model, and we identify a new critical point. We discuss the implications of our work for Kondo lattice systems and engineered long-range interacting quantum systems.", "authors": "Simon Martin, Tarun Grover", "date": "26 Jul 2023 ("},
{"title": "Population III star formation: multiple gas phases prevent the use of an equation of state at high densities", "abstract": "Advanced primordial chemistry networks have been developed to model the collapse of metal-free baryonic gas within the gravitational well of dark matter (DM) halos and its subsequent collapse into Population III stars. At the low densities of 10^-26-10^-21 g cm-3 (10-3-10^2 cm-3) the collapse is dependent on H2 production, which is a function of the compressional heating provided by the DM potential. Once the gas decouples from the DM, the temperature-density relationship follows a well established path dictated by various chemical reactions until the formation of the protostar at 10^-4 g cm-3 (10^19 cm-3). Here we explore the feasibility of replacing the chemical network (CN) with a barotropic equation of state (EoS) just before the formation of the first protostar, to reduce the computational load of simulating the further fragmentation, evolution and characteristics of the very high density gas. We find a significant reduction in fragmentation when using the EoS. The EoS method produces a protostellar mass distribution that peaks at higher masses when compared to CN runs. The change in fragmentation behaviour is due to a lack of cold gas falling in through the disc around the first protostar when using an EoS. Despite this, the total mass accreted across all sinks was invariant to the switch to an EoS, hence the star formation rate (Msun yr^-1) is accurately predicted using an EoS. The EoS routine is approximately 4000 times faster than the CN, however this numerical gain is offset by the lack of accuracy in modelling secondary protostar formation and hence its use must be considered carefully.", "authors": "Lewis R.

We see the formation of a well-defined, steady-state accretion disk which is stable against star formation at sub-pc scales. The disks are optically thick, with radiative cooling balancing accretion, but with properties that are distinct from those assumed in most previous accretion disk models. The pressure is strongly dominated by (primarily toroidal) magnetic fields, with a plasma $\\beta \\sim 10^{-4}$ even in the disk midplane. They are qualitatively distinct from magnetically elevated or arrested disks. The disks are strongly turbulent, with trans-Alfvenic and highly super-sonic turbulence, and balance this via a cooling time that is short compared to the disk dynamical time, and can sustain highly super-Eddington accretion rates. Their surface and 3D densities at $\\sim 10^{3}-10^{5}$ gravitational radii are much lower than in a Shakura-Sunyaev disk, with important implications for their thermo-chemistry and stability. We show how the magnetic field strengths and geometries arise from rapid advection of flux with the inflow from much weaker galaxy-scale fields in these 'flux-frozen' disks, and how this stabilizes the disk and gives rise to efficient torques.

We study the donor-bound exciton optical linewidth properties of Al, Ga, and In donors in single-crystal ZnO. The ensemble photoluminescence linewidth ranges from 4-11 GHz, less than two orders of magnitude larger than the expected lifetime-limited linewidth. The ensemble linewidth remains narrow in absorption through samples with an estimated optical depth up to several hundred. The primary thermal relaxation mechanism is identified and found to have a negligible contribution to the total linewidth at 2 K. We find that inhomogeneous broadening due to the disordered isotopic environment in natural ZnO is significant, contributing 2 GHz. Two-laser spectral hole burning measurements, indicate the dominant mechanism, however, is homogeneous.

However, at some point the approximations used on ISM scales (e.g. optically-thin cooling and stellar-population-integrated star formation [SF] and feedback [FB]) break down. We therefore present the first cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation which self-consistently combines the FIRE physics (relevant on galactic/ISM scales where SF/FB are ensemble-averaged) and STARFORGE physics (relevant on small scales where we track individual (proto)stellar formation and evolution), together with explicit RMHD (including non-ideal MHD and multi-band M1-RHD) which self-consistently treats both optically-thick and thin regimes.

A chemical/mechanical change introduced at a moiety of biomolecules, such as an amino acid substitution or a structural change of a chromophore by the photo-excitation, is considered as a perturbation, and the rest of the protein as the reference system. The linear-response equation consists of two parts: a mechanical/chemical perturbation introduced at the moiety, and the variance-covariance matrix of the reference system that works as a response function. The physical meaning of the equation is transparent: the force exerted by atoms in the moiety induces the displacement in an atom of protein, which propagates through the variance-covariance matrix to cause a global conformational change in the molecule.

{"title": "Chemical evolution of local post-starburst galaxies: Implications for the mass-metallicity relation", "abstract": "We use the stellar fossil record to constrain the stellar metallicity evolution and star-formation histories of the post-starburst regions within 45 local post-starburst galaxies from the MaNGA survey. The direct measurement of the regions' stellar metallicity evolution is achieved by a new two-step metallicity model that allows for stellar metallicity to change at the peak of the starburst. We also employ a Gaussian process noise model that accounts for correlated errors introduced by the observational data reduction or inaccuracies in the models. We find that a majority of post-starburst regions (69% at $>1\\sigma$ significance) increased in stellar metallicity during the recent starburst, with an average increase of 0.8 dex and a standard deviation of 0.4 dex. A much smaller fraction of PSBs are found to have remained constant (22%) or declined in metallicity (9%, average decrease 0.4 dex, standard deviation 0.3 dex). The pre-burst metallicities of the post-starburst galaxies are in good agreement with the mass-metallicity relation of local star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with hydrodynamic simulations, which suggest that mergers between gas-rich galaxies are the primary formation mechanism of local PSBs, and rapid metal recycling during the starburst outweighs the impact of dilution by any gas inflows. The final mass-weighted metallicities of the post-starburst galaxies are consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of local passive galaxies. Our results suggest that rapid quenching following a merger-driven starburst is entirely consistent with the observed gap between the stellar mass-metallicity relations of local star-forming and passive galaxies.", "authors": "Ho-Hin Leung, Vivienne Wild, Michail Papathomas, Adam Carnall, Yirui Zheng, Nicholas Boardman, Cara Wang, Peter H.

Traditional asteroseismic techniques, primarily focused on power spectral analysis, often overlook the crucial phase information in these light curves. Addressing this gap, recent machine learning applications, particularly those using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have made strides in inferring stellar properties from light curves. However, CNNs are limited by their localized feature extraction capabilities. In response, we introduce $\\textit{Astroconformer}$, a Transformer-based deep learning framework, specifically designed to capture long-range dependencies in stellar light curves. Our empirical analysis centers on estimating surface gravity ($\\log g$), using a dataset derived from single-quarter Kepler light curves with $\\log g$ values ranging from 0.2 to 4.4. $\\textit{Astroconformer}$ demonstrates superior performance, achieving a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.017 dex at $\\log g\\approx3$ in data-rich regimes and up to 0.1 dex in sparser areas.

We propose two possible implementations of our gate-controlled mechanism: (i) a topological field-effect Josephson diode in time-reversal-broken quantum spin Hall insulators; and (ii) semiconductor-based field-effect Josephson diodes attainable in current experimental setups involving a Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling. Notably, the diode efficiency is highly enhanced in the topological field-effect Josephson diode because the current carried by the asymmetric helical edge states is topologically protected and can be tuned by local gates. In the proposed Josephson diode, the combination of gates and asymmetric spin-momentum-locking nature is equivalent to that of a magnetic field, thus providing an alternative electrical operation in designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices.", "authors": "Pei-Hao Fu, Yong Xu, Shengyuan A.

We perform two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations using the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code JET with its radiation treatment module. We study the impact of black hole mass, accretion efficiency, and inclination between the orbital and spin planes.

{"title": "Discontinuous shear thickening in biological tissue rheology", "abstract": "During embryonic morphogenesis, tissues undergo dramatic deformations in order to form functional organs. Similarly, in adult animals, living cells and tissues are continually subjected to forces and deformations. Therefore, the success of embryonic development and the proper maintenance of physiological functions rely on the ability of cells to withstand mechanical stresses as well as their ability to flow in a collective manner. During these events, mechanical perturbations can originate from active processes at the single cell level, competing with external stresses exerted by surrounding tissues and organs. However, the study of tissue mechanics has been somewhat limited to either the response to external forces or to intrinsic ones. In this work, we use an active vertex model of a 2D confluent tissue to study the interplay of external deformations that are applied globally to a tissue with internal active stresses that arise locally at the cellular level due to cell motility. We elucidate in particular the way in which this interplay between globally external and locally internal active driving determines the emergent mechanical properties of the tissue as a whole. For a tissue in the vicinity of a solid-fluid jamming/unjamming transition, we uncover a host of fascinating rheological phenomena, including yielding, shear thinning, continuous shear thickening (CST) and discontinuous shear thickening (DST).

While these studies shown that the correlation between vector field and local contribution to the divergence can be well characterized by coordination number for a set of selected structural degree of freedoms (SDFs), it is unclear whether the correlations between different set of SDFs purely comes from the difference in covariance matrix of CDOS (determined by coordination number) or additional information such as the shape of CP should be further required. To clarify the problem, we here propose simplified model of the so-called Coupled Linear System (CLS), which consists of the m-mixture of the configurational density of states for linear systems. We demonstrate that the CLS can reasonablly capture the changes in the local nonlinearity w.r.t. the changes in coordination number.

{"title": "Study of Nonlinear Evolution of Spacetime Fluctuations in Quantum Gravity Inflation for Deriving Primordial Spectrum", "abstract": "We study the evolution of quantum fluctuations of gravity around an inflationary solution in renormalizable quantum gravity, in which the initial scalar-fluctuation dominance is shown by the background-free nature expressed by a special conformal invariance. Inflation ignites at the Planck scale and continues until spacetime phase transition occurs at a dynamical scale about $10^{17}$GeV. We can show that during inflation, the initially large scale-invariant fluctuations reduce in amplitude to the appropriate magnitude suggested by tiny CMB anisotropies. The goal of this research is to derive the spectra of scalar fluctuations at the phase transition point, that is, the primordial spectra. A system of nonlinear evolution equations for the fluctuations is derived from the quantum gravity effective action. The running coupling constant is then expressed by a time-dependent average following the spirit of the mean field approximation. In this paper, we determine and examine various nonlinear terms, not treated in previous studies such as the exponential factor of the conformal mode. These contributions occur during the early stage of inflation when the amplitude is still large.

The result indicates that they serve to maintain the initial scale invariance over a wide range beyond the comoving Planck scale.

{"title": "An optimization-based equilibrium measure describes non-equilibrium steady state dynamics: application to edge of chaos", "abstract": "Understanding neural dynamics is a central topic in machine learning, non-linear physics and neuroscience. However, the dynamics is non-linear, stochastic and particularly non-gradient, i.e., the driving force can not be written as gradient of a potential. These features make analytic studies very challenging. The common tool is to use path integral approach or dynamical mean-field theory, but the drawback is one has to solve the integro-differential or dynamical mean-field equations, which is computationally expensive and has no closed form solutions in general. From the aspect of associated Fokker-Planck equation, the steady state solution is generally unknown. Here, we treat searching for the steady state as an optimization problem, and construct an approximate potential closely related to the speed of the dynamics, and find that searching for the ground state of this potential is equivalent to running a stochastic gradient dynamics. The resultant stationary state follows exactly the canonical Boltzmann measure. Within this framework, the quenched disorder intrinsic in the neural networks can be averaged out by applying the replica method. Our theory reproduces the well-known result of edge-of-chaos, and further the order parameters characterizing the continuous transition are derived, and different scaling behavior with respect to inverse temperature in both sides of the transition is also revealed. Our method opens the door to analytically study the steady state landscape of the deterministic or stochastic high dimensional dynamics.", "authors": "Junbin Qiu, Haiping Huang", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A qubit regularization of asymptotic freedom without fine-tuning", "abstract": "Other than the commonly used Wilson's regularization of quantum field theories (QFTs), there is a growing interest in regularizations that explore lattice models with a strictly finite local Hilbert space, in anticipation of the upcoming era of quantum simulations of QFTs. A notable example is Euclidean qubit regularization, which provides a natural way to recover continuum QFTs that emerge via infrared fixed points of lattice theories. Can such regularizations also capture the physics of ultraviolet fixed points? We present a novel regularization of the asymptotically free massive continuum QFT that emerges at the Berezenski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition through a hard core loop-gas model, discussing the advantages this model provides compared to traditional regularizations. In particular, we demonstrate that without the need for fine-tuning, it can reproduce the universal step-scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition.", "authors": "Sandip Maiti, Debasish Banerjee, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Marina Krstic Marinkovic", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals", "abstract": "In future gravitational-wave (GW) detections, a large number of overlapping GW signals will appear in the data stream of detectors. When extracting information from one signal, the presence of other signals can cause large parameter estimation biases. Using the Fisher matrix (FM), we develop a bias analysis procedure to investigate how each parameter of other signals affects the inference biases. Taking two-signal overlapping as an example, we show detailedly and quantitatively that the biases essentially originate from the overlapping of the frequency evolution. Furthermore, we find that the behaviors of the correlation coefficients between the parameters of the two signals are similar to the biases. Both of them can be used as characterization of the influence between signals. We also corroborate the bias results of the FM method with full Bayesian analysis. Our results can provide guidance for the development of new PE algorithms on overlapping signals, and the analysis methodology has the potential to generalize.", "authors": "Ziming Wang, Dicong Liang, Junjie Zhao, Chang Liu, Lijing Shao", "date": "13 Apr 2023 ("},

{"title": "Searches for Connections between Dark Matter and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube", "abstract": "In this work, we present the results of searches for signatures of dark matter decay or annihilation into Standard Model particles, and secret neutrino interactions with dark matter. Neutrinos could be produced in the decay or annihilation of galactic or extragalactic dark matter. Additionally, if an interaction between dark matter and neutrinos exists then dark matter will interact with extragalactic neutrinos. In particular galactic dark matter will induce an anisotropy in the neutrino sky if this interaction is present. We use seven and a half years of the High-Energy Starting Event (HESE) sample data, which measures neutrinos in the energy range of approximately 60 TeV to 10 PeV, to study these phenomena. This all-sky event selection is dominated by extragalactic neutrinos. For dark matter of $\\sim$ 1 PeV in mass, we constrain the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section to be smaller than $10^{-23}$cm$^3$/s for the exclusive $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ channel and $10^{-22}$ cm$^3$/s for the $b\\bar b$ channel. For the same mass, we constrain the lifetime of dark matter to be larger than $10^{28}$ s for all channels studied, except for decaying exclusively to $b\\bar b$ where it is bounded to be larger than $10^{27}$ s. Finally, we also search for evidence of astrophysical neutrinos scattering on galactic dark matter in two scenarios. For fermionic dark matter with a vector mediator, we constrain the dimensionless coupling associated with this interaction to be less than 0.1 for dark matter mass of 0.1 GeV and a mediator mass of $10^{-4}~$ GeV.

{"title": "Neutrino forces in neutrino backgrounds", "abstract": "The Standard Model predicts a long-range force, proportional to $G_F^2/r^5$, between fermions due to the exchange of a pair of neutrinos. This quantum force is feeble and has not been observed yet. In this paper, we compute this force in the presence of neutrino backgrounds, both for isotropic and directional background neutrinos. We find that for the case of directional background the force can have a $1/r$ dependence and it can be significantly enhanced compared to the vacuum case. In particular, background effects caused by reactor, solar, and supernova neutrinos enhance the force by many orders of magnitude. The enhancement, however, occurs only in the direction parallel to the direction of the background neutrinos. We discuss the experimental prospects of detecting the neutrino force in neutrino backgrounds and find that the effect is close to the available sensitivity of the current fifth force experiments. Yet, the angular spread of the neutrino flux and that of the test masses reduce the strength of this force. The results are encouraging and a detailed experimental study is called for to check if the effect can be probed.", "authors": "Mitrajyoti Ghosh, Yuval Grossman, Walter Tangarife, Xun-Jie Xu, Bingrong Yu", "date": "15 Sep 2022 ("},

We employ a coherent-state path integral and renormalization group approach to calculate the first moment and two-point correlation function of the enzyme-binding profile. We show that starting from an empty substrate the average occupancy follows a power law with an exponent $1/(1-\\lambda)$ over time. The correlation function decays algebraically with two distinct spatial regimes characterized by exponents $-\\lambda$ on short distances and $-(2/3)(2-\\lambda)$ on long distances.

The construct defines quantum-entangled, two-photon states that form an angular-momentum-like basis, with symmetry corresponding to physical conservation of total photon number, with respect to the combined transmon and readout. This basis provides a convenient starting point from which to study error-inducing effects of transmon anharmonicity, surrounding-environment decoherence, and random stray fields on qubit state and gate operations. Employing a Lindblad master equation to model dissipation to the surrounding environment, and incorporating the effect of weak transmon anharmonicity, we present examples of the utility of the construct. First, we calculate the frequency response associated with exciting the ground state to a Rabi resonance with the lowest-lying spin-1/2 moment, via a driving external voltage. Second, we calculate the frequency response between the three lowest two-photon states, within a ladder-type excitation scheme.

Based on the Fourier amplitude spectra, we identify 848 delta Scuti stars, as well as 47 eclipsing or contact binaries. The strongest pulsation modes of some delta Scuti stars fall on the period-luminosity relation of the fundamental radial mode but many correspond to overtones that are approximately a factor of two higher in frequency. Many of the low-luminosity delta Scuti stars show a series of high-frequency modes with very regular spacings. The fraction of stars in our sample that show delta Scuti pulsations is about 70% for the brightest stars (G<8), consistent with results from Kepler. However, the fraction drops to about 45% for fainter stars and we find that a single sector of TESS data only detects the lowest-amplitude delta Scuti pulsations (around 50 ppm) in stars down to about G=9. Finally, we have found four new high-frequency delta Scuti stars with very regular mode patterns, and have detected pulsations in lambda Mus that make it the fourth-brightest delta Scuti in the sky (G=3.63).

Additionally, the shock layers are often penetrated by the flows of interstellar atoms, as, for instance, in the astrospheres of the stars embedded by the partially ionized interstellar clouds. This paper presents a simple toy model of a shock layer that aims to qualitatively describe the influence of charge exchange with interstellar hydrogen atoms on the plasma flow in astrospheric shock layers. To clearly explore this effect, magnetic fields are neglected, and the geometry is kept as simple as possible. The model explains why the cooling of plasma due to charge exchange in the inner heliosheath leads to an increase in plasma density in front of the heliopause. It also demonstrates that the source of momentum causes changes in the pressure profile within the shock layer. The paper also discusses the decrease in plasma density near the astropause in the outer shock layer in the case of layer heating, which is particularly relevant in light of the Voyager measurements in the heliospheric shock layer.", "authors": "S.D.

{"title": "Transverse MHD waves as signatures of braiding-induced magnetic reconnection in coronal loops", "abstract": "A major coronal heating theory based on magnetic reconnection relies on the existence of braided magnetic field structures in the corona. In this small-angle reconnection scenario, numerical simulations indicate that the reconnected magnetic field lines are driven sideways by magnetic tension and can overshoot from their new rest position, thereby leading to low-amplitude transverse MHD waves. This provides an efficient mechanism for transverse MHD wave generation, and the direct causality also constitutes substantial evidence of reconnection from braiding. However, this wave-generation mechanism has never been directly observed. Recently, the telltale signature of small-angle reconnection in a sheared coronal structure has been identified through nanojets, which are small, short-lived, and fast jet-like bursts in the nanoflare range transverse to the guide-field. We present for the first time IRIS and SDO observations of transverse MHD waves in a coronal loop that directly result from braiding-induced reconnection. The reconnection is identified by the presence of nanojets at the loop apex which release nanoflare-range energy. We find that the oscillations have an energy flux on the order of $10^6 - 10^8$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, which is within the budget to power active region loops. The estimated kinetic and thermal energy from the nanojets is also sufficient to power the transverse waves and sustain the observed heating at the loop apex.

{"title": "Hydrogen recombination continuum as the radiative model for stellar optical flares", "abstract": "The study of stellar flares has increased with new observations from CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS satellites, revealing the broadband visible emission from these events. Typically, stellar flares have been modelled as $10^4$ K blackbody plasma to obtain estimates of their total energy. In the Sun, white light flares (WLFs) are much fainter than their stellar counterparts, and normally can only be detected via spatially resolved observations. Identifying the radiation mechanism for the formation of the visible spectrum from solar and stellar flares is crucial to understand the energy transfer processes during these events, but spectral data for WLFs are relatively rare, and insufficient to remove the ambiguity of their origin: photospheric blackbody radiation and/or Paschen continuum from hydrogen recombination in the chromosphere. We employed an analytical solution for the recombination continuum of hydrogen instead of the typically assumed $10^4$ K blackbody spectrum to study the energy of stellar flares and infer their fractional area coverage. We investigated 37 events from Kepler-411 and 5 events from Kepler-396, using both radiation mechanisms. We find that estimates for the total flare energy from the H recombination spectrum are about an order of magnitude lower than the values obtained from the blackbody radiation. Given the known energy transfer processes in flares, we argue that the former is a physically more plausible model than the latter to explain the origin of the broadband optical emission from flares.", "authors": "Paulo J.

No extra energy is needed to explain oxygen-neon white dwarfs paired with AFGK-type main-sequence stars", "abstract": "In this first of a series of papers related to long-period post-common-envelope (CE) binaries, we investigated whether extra energy is required or not to explain the currently known post-CE binaries with sufficiently long orbital periods consisting of oxygen-neon white dwarfs with AFGK-type main-sequence star companions. We carried out binary population simulations with the BSE code and searched for their formation pathways. Unlike what has been claimed for a long time, we show that all such post-CE binaries can be explained by assuming inefficient CE evolution, which is consistent with results achieved for the remaining post-CE binaries. There is therefore no need for an extra energy source. We also found that for CE efficiency close to 100%, post-CE binaries hosting oxygen-neon white dwarfs with orbital periods as long as a thousand days can be explained. For all known systems we found formation pathways consisting of CE evolution triggered when a highly evolved (i.e. the envelope mass being comparable to the core mass) thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch star fills its Roche lobe at an orbital period of several thousand days. Due to the sufficiently low envelope mass and sufficiently long orbital period, the resulting post-CE orbital period can easily be several tens of days. We conclude that the known post-CE binaries with oxygen-neon white dwarfs and AFGK-type main-sequence stars can be explained without invoking any energy source other than orbital and thermal energy. Our results strengthen the idea that the most common formation pathway of the overall population of post-CE binaries hosting white dwarfs is through inefficient CE evolution.", "authors": "Diogo Belloni, Monica Zorotovic, Matthias R.

EFOPA integrates NOMA with VLC, utilizing the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm for offline resource allocation planning. The approach then derives a simplified power allocation equation from ABC outcomes, ensuring fair resource distribution among users. EFOPA is compared against existing power allocation methods, demonstrating superior fairness and reduced computational complexity.

Optical and near-IR emission lines are potentially good tracers of inner disk processes if very high spatial and/or spectral resolution are achieved. In this paper, we exploit the capabilities of the VLTI-GRAVITY near-IR interferometer to determine the location and kinematics of the hydrogen emission line Bracket gamma. We present VLTI-GRAVITY observations of the Bracket gamma line for a sample of 26 stars of intermediate mass (HAEBE), the largest sample so far analysed with near-IR interferometry. The Bracket gamma line was detected in 17 objects. The emission is very compact (in most cases only marginally resolved), with a size of 10-30R* (1-5 mas). About half of the total flux comes from even smaller regions, which are unresolved in our data. For eight objects, it was possible to determine the position angle (PA) of the line-emitting region, which is generally in agreement with that of the inner-dusty disk emitting the K-band continuum. The position-velocity pattern of the Bracket gamma line-emitting region of the sampled objects is roughly consistent with Keplerian rotation. The exception is HD~45677, which shows more extended emission and more complex kinematics. The most likely scenario for the Bracket gamma origin is that the emission comes from an MHD wind launched very close to the central star, in a region well within the dust sublimation radius. An origin in the bound gas layer at the disk surface cannot be ruled out, while accreting matter provides only a minor fraction of the total flux.

We first put forth a random graph model, called the multi-view stochastic block model (MVSBM), designed to generate correlated graphs on the same set of nodes (with cardinality $n$). The $n$ nodes are partitioned into two disjoint communities of equal size. The presence or absence of edges in the graphs for each pair of nodes depends on whether the two nodes belong to the same community or not. The objective for the learner is to recover the hidden communities with observed graphs. Our technical contributions are two-fold: (i) We establish an information-theoretic upper bound (Theorem~1) showing that exact recovery of community is achievable when the model parameters of MVSBM exceed a certain threshold. (ii) Conversely, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound (Theorem~2) showing that when the model parameters of MVSBM fall below the aforementioned threshold, then for any estimator, the expected number of misclassified nodes will always be greater than one. Our results for the MVSBM recover several prior results for community detection in the standard SBM as well as in multiple independent SBMs as special cases.", "authors": "Yexin Zhang, Zhongtian Ma, Qiaosheng Zhang, Zhen Wang, Xuelong Li", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Second, we propose a fast noise level estimation method using eigenvalues of the covariance matrix on a graph.

{"title": "Extended Main Sequences in Star Clusters", "abstract": "Extended main sequences (eMSs) and extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) are fascinating phenomena that are routinely observed in star clusters. These phenomena strongly challenge the current canonical \"simple stellar population\" picture of star clusters, which postulates that star clusters are coeval and chemically homogeneous and can thus be described by a single, unique isochrone. Detections of eMSs and eMSTOs provide valuable insights into stellar physics and the evolution of star clusters. This comprehensive review delves into the observational characteristics, underlying mechanisms, and astrophysical implications of the eMSs and eMSTOs observed in young (less than 600 million years) and intermediate-age (600 to 2000 million years) star clusters. Several scenarios or hypotheses have been proposed to explain these phenomena, including the presence of an age spread, binary interactions, variable stars, and differences in stellar rotation rates. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of current models. Among contemporary models and hypotheses, stellar rotation has been demonstrated as the most plausible mechanism to explain the occurrence of eMSs and eMSTOs. Research on stellar rotation and its connection to eMSs has opened up a myriad of fascinating avenues, such as investigations of the magnetic braking mechanism in stars, searches for tidally locked binary systems in star clusters, and investigations as to whether binary mergers can give rise to massive magnetars.

Recently, active RIS has been proposed to compensate the multiplicative fading effect inherent in passive RISs. However, conventional distributed active RISs, with at least one amplifier per element, are costly, complex, and power-intensive. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel architecture of active RIS: the centralized active RIS (CA-RIS), which amplifies the energy using a centralized amplifying reflector to reduce the number of amplifiers. Under this architecture, only as low as one amplifier is needed for power amplification of the entire array. We evaluate the performance of CA-RIS, specifically its path loss, and compare it with conventional passive RISs, revealing a moderate amplification gain. Furthermore, the proposed CA-RIS and the path loss model are experimentally verified, achieving a 9.6 dB net gain over passive RIS at 4 GHz. The CA-RIS offers a substantial simplification of active RIS architecture while preserving performance, striking an optimal balance between system complexity and the performance, which is competitive in various scenarios.", "authors": "Changhao Liu, Fan Yang, Shenheng Xu, Yezhen Li, Maokun Li", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

The proposed power allocation algorithm is compared to a communication-centric approach where only the URLLC requirement is considered. It is shown that the URLLC-only approach is incapable of meeting sensing requirements, while the proposed ISAC algorithm fulfills both sensing and URLLC requirements, albeit with an associated increase in energy consumption.

The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this paper, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle errors and failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original system.

Based on the orbital parameters and TEO candidates from our previous works, we identify the pulsation phases and mode of TEOs in fourteen Kepler HBSs. The pulsation phases of most systems can be explained by the dominant modes spherical harmonic $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\\pm2$ modes, assuming the spin and orbital axes are aligned and the pulsations are adiabatic, except for five systems that show large median deviations ($>2\\sigma$). The largest deviation ($>6\\sigma$), in KIC 8459354, can be explained by the spin-orbit misalignment since the high eccentricity and the long orbital period. Besides the two existing reasons for the large deviations, we additionally suggest that the apsidal motion could be another reason. In addition, for KIC 11122789, almost half of the harmonics show large deviations, we suggest that these harmonics may not be considered as TEO candidates. This phases and mode identification approach can then be used inversely to verify the TEO candidates derived by the Fourier analysis.", "authors": "Min-Yu Li, Sheng-Bang Qian, Li-Ying Zhu, Zhao Guo, Wen-Ping Liao, Er-Gang Zhao, Xiang-Dong Shi, Fu-Xing Li, Qi-Bin Sun", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "ZZ Tau IRS: a low mass UX Ori type star with strong wind", "abstract": "The results of photometric, polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of the young star ZZ Tau IRS in the visible and near-infrared bands are presented. Against the continuum of an M spectral type star about 50 emission lines of allowed (HI, HeI, NaI, SII) and forbidden (OI, OII, OIII, NI, NII, SII, CaII, FeII, NiII) transitions were identified. It was found that from the autumn of 2020 to the beginning of 2023, the brightness of the star in the visible region decreased $(\\Delta I \\approx 1.5^m),$ and then began to return to initial level. As the visible brightness of the star declined, its colour indices decreased in the visible region, but increased in the near-IR bands. At light minimum, the degree of polarization in the $I$ band reached $\\approx$ 13%, and the equivalent widths of e.g. the H$\\alpha$ and [SII] 6731 A lines increased to 376 and 79 A, respectively. Arguments are given in favour of ZZ Tau IRS being a UX Ori type star, and its variability being due to eclipses by dust clouds, which are inhomogeneities in the dusty disc wind. Forbidden lines are formed both in the disc wind and in the jet, the axis of which is oriented along PA$=61\\pm 3$ degrees. The jet mass-loss rate is $>5 \\times 10^{-10}$ M$_\\odot$/yr, what is abnormally large for a star with a mass of $<0.3$ M$_\\odot.$ Apparently, the disc wind of ZZ Tau IRS is not axially symmetric, probably due to the azimuthal asymmetry of the protoplanetary disc found earlier from ALMA observations.", "authors": "M.A. Burlak, A.V.

{"title": "2D Unified Atmosphere and Wind Simulations of O-stars", "abstract": "Massive and luminous O-star atmospheres with winds have been studied primarily using one-dimensional (1D), spherically symmetric, and stationary models. However, observations and theory rather suggest that O-star atmospheres are highly structured, turbulent, and time-dependent. As such, when comparing to observations, present-day 1D modeling tools need to introduce ad-hoc quantities such as photospheric macro & microturbulence, wind clumping, etc. We present multi-dimensional, time-dependent, radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations for O-stars that encapsulate the deeper sub-surface envelope (down to T ~ 450 kK) as well as the supersonic line-driven wind outflow in one unified approach. Time-dependent, two-dimensional (2D) simulations of O-star atmospheres with winds are performed using a flux-limiting RHD finite volume modeling technique. Opacities are computed using a hybrid approach combining tabulated Rosseland means with calculations (based on the Sobolev approximation) of the enhanced line opacities expected for supersonic flows. When compared to 1D models, the average structures in the 2D simulations display less envelope expansion, no sharp density-inversions, density and temperature profiles that are significantly less steep around the photosphere, and a strong anti-correlation between velocity and density in the supersonic wind. To qualitatively match the different density and temperature profiles seen in our multi-D and 1D models, we need to add a modest amount of convective energy transport in the deep sub-surface layers and a large turbulent pressure around the photosphere to the 1D models.", "authors": "D.

However, designing a routing scheme for ISTN is exceedingly difficult, primarily due to the heightened complexity resulting from the inclusion of additional ground stations, along with the requirement to satisfy various constraints related to satellite service quality. To address these challenges, we study packet routing with ground stations and satellites working jointly to transmit packets, while prioritizing fast communication and meeting energy efficiency and packet loss requirements. Specifically, we formulate the problem of packet routing with constraints as a max-min problem using the Lagrange method. Then we propose a novel constrained Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (MARL) dynamic routing algorithm named CMADR, which efficiently balances objective improvement and constraint satisfaction during the updating of policy and Lagrange multipliers. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and an ablation study using the OneWeb and Telesat mega-constellations. Results demonstrate that CMADR reduces the packet delay by a minimum of 21% and 15%, while meeting stringent energy consumption and packet loss rate constraints, outperforming several baseline algorithms.", "authors": "Yifeng Lyu, Han Hu, Rongfei Fan, Zhi Liu, Jianping An, Shiwen Mao", "date": "23 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "LoS Coverage Analysis for UAV-based THz Communication Networks: Towards 3D Visualization of Wireless Networks", "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) links require a line-of-sight (LoS) connection, which is hard to be obtained in most scenarios. For THz communications, analyses based on LoS probability are not accurate, and a new real LoS model should be considered to determine the LoS status of the link in a real 3D environment. Considering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based THz networks, LoS coverage is analyzed in this work, where nodes are accurately determined to be in LoS or not. Specifically, by modeling an environment with 3D blocks, our target is to locate a set of UAVs equipped with directional THz links to provide LoS connectivity for the distributed users among the 3D obstacles. To this end, we first characterize and model the environment with 3D blocks. Then, we propose a user-friendly algorithm based on 3D spatial vectors, which determines the LoS status of nodes in the target area. In addition, using 3D modeling, several meta-heuristic algorithms are proposed for UAVs' positioning under 3D blocks in order to maximize the LoS coverage percentage. In the second part of the paper, for a UAV-based THz communication network, a geometrical analysis-based algorithm is proposed, which jointly clusters the distributed nodes and locates the set of UAVs to maximize average network capacity while ensuring the LoS state of distributed nodes among 3D obstacles. Moreover, we also propose a sub-optimal hybrid k-means-geometrical-based algorithm with a low computational complexity that can be used for networks where the topology continuously changes, and thus, users' clustering and UAVs' positioning need to be regularly updated. Finally, by providing various 3D simulations, we evaluate the effect of various system parameters such as the number and heights of UAVs, as well as the density and height of 3D obstacles on the LoS coverage.", "authors": "Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, MazenHasna, Saud Althunibat, Khalid Qaraqe", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

To this end, first, a comprehensive channel modeling is conducted considering key real channel parameters including mechanical gimbal error, fast steering mirror angle error, laser beamwidth, MRR area, atmospheric turbulence, and channel coherence time. Accordingly, a closed-form expression for the distribution of the received signal is derived and utilized to propose a maximum likelihood based method to sense and estimate the initial position of the satellite. Subsequently, the distribution of the distance estimation error during the sensing phase is formulated as a function of the laser beamwidth and the gimbal error, which enables us to fine-tune the optimal laser beamwidth to minimize sensing time. Moreover, using the sensing and initial satellite distance estimation, two positioning algorithms are proposed. To compare the performance of the proposed positioning method, we obtain the lower bound of the positioning error as a benchmark.

We use potential theory to formulate the non-linear hydrodynamical equations and test dilatations of the quasi-equilibrium initial conditions. We find that a wide range of flow patterns can basically be generated and the time scales can switch, based on initial conditions, and lead to eruptive processes, reinforcing that the non-linear fluid environment includes both quasi-stationary structures and fast processes like finite-time singularities.

Hand-designed models, however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning. This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of many robots are described in terms of their generalized coordinates on a matrix Lie group, e.g. on SE(3) for ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation of energy principles. This paper proposes a (port-)Hamiltonian formulation over a Lie group of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) network to approximate the robot dynamics. In contrast to a black-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees energy conservation principle and Lie group's constraints by construction and explicitly accounts for energy-dissipation effect such as friction and drag forces in the dynamics model.

We classified 12 moving knot groups among 17 total knot groups based on their constant proper motions and comparable radial velocities. A strong correlation emerges between deprojected flow velocities of the knots and the photometric magnitudes of DG Tau. From 1983 to 1995, as the deprojected ejection velocities surged from $\\sim$ 273 $\\pm$ 15 km s$^{-1}$ to $\\sim$ 427 $\\pm$ 16 km s$^{-1}$, the photometric magnitudes ($V$) concurrently brightened from 12.3 to 11.4. Notably, when DG Tau became brighter than 12.2 in the $V$ band, its ($B-V$) color shifted bluer than its intrinsic color range of K5 to M0. During this period, the launching point of the jet in the protoplanetary disk moved closer to 0.06 AU from the star in 1995. Following a $V$ magnitude drop from 11.7 to 13.4 in 1998, the star may have experienced significant extinction due to a dust wall created by the disk wind during the ejection of the high-velocity knot in 1999. Since then, the magnitude became fainter than 12.2, the ($B-V$) and ($V-R$) colors became redder, and the deprojected velocities consistently remained below 200 km s$^{-1}$. The launching point of the jet then moved away to $\\sim$ 0.45 AU by 2008.

Prior research often treats dynamic team composition as a consequence of suboptimal organizational design choices. The emergence of new organizational forms that consciously employ teams that change their composition periodically challenges this perspective. In this paper, we follow the contingency theory and characterize dynamic team composition as a design choice that interacts with other choices such as the coordination mode, and with additional contextual factors such as individual learning and task complexity. We employ an agent-based modeling approach based on the NK framework, which includes a reinforcement learning mechanism, a recurring team formation mechanism based on signaling, and three different coordination modes. Our results suggest that by implementing lateral communication or sequential decision-making, teams may exploit the benefits of dynamic composition more than if decision-making is fully autonomous. The choice of a proper coordination mode, however, is partly moderated by the task complexity and individual learning. Additionally, we show that only a coordination mode based on lateral communication may prevent the negative effects of individual learning.", "authors": "Darío Blanco-Fernández, Stephan Leitner, Alexandra Rausch", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

The transition from the spherically symmetric envelopes around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to the asymmetric morphologies observed in planetary nebulae is still not well understood, and the shaping mechanisms are a subject of debate. Even though binarity is widely accepted as a promising option. Recently, the presence of ultraviolet excesses in AGB stars has been suggested as a potential indicator of binarity. Aims. Our main goals are to characterise the properties of the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) around candidate AGB binary stars, specifically those selected based on their UV excess emission, and to compare these properties with those derived from previous CO-based studies of AGB stars. Methods. We observed the 12CO ($J$=1-0) and 12CO ($J$=2-1) millimetre-wavelength emission in a sample of 29 AGB binary candidates with the IRAM-30 m antenna. We explored different trends between the envelope parameters deduced and compared them with those previously derived from larger samples of AGB stars found in the literature. Results. We derived the average excitation temperature and column density of the CO-emitting layers, which we used to estimate self-consistently the average mass-loss rate and the CO photodissociation radius of our targets. We find a correlation between CO intensity and IRAS 60${\\mu}$m fluxes, revealing a CO-to-IRAS 60${\\mu}$m ratio lower than for AGB stars and closer to that found for pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe). Conclusions. For the first time we have studied the mass-loss properties of UV-excess AGB binary candidates and estimated their main CSE parameters.

In this paper, we study the joint optimization of beam direction and the allocation of spectrum, time, and power resource in a dynamic multi-beam LEO satellite network. The objective is to improve long-term user sum data rate while taking user fairness into account. Since the concerned resource management problem is mixed-integer non-convex programming, the problem is decomposed into three subproblems, namely beam direction control and time slot allocation, user subchannel assignment, and beam power allocation. Then, these subproblems are solved iteratively by leveraging matching with externalities and successive convex approximation, and the proposed algorithms are analyzed in terms of stability, convergence, and complexity.

{"title": "Optimizing Visible Light Communication Efficiency Through Reinforcement Learning-Based NOMA-CSK Integration", "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the use of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and Color Shift Keying (CSK) for Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. VLC is a wireless communication technology that uses visible light as the carrier signal to transmit information. It has several advantages over traditional radio frequency communication, including higher bandwidth, lower interference, and greater security. We first provide an introduction to NOMA and CSK and explain how they can be applied to VLC systems. NOMA is a technique that allows multiple users to share the same frequency channel by allocating different power levels to each user. This enables more users to connect to a single VLC transmitter simultaneously, thereby improving system capacity and spectral efficiency. CSK, on the other hand, is a modulation technique that uses different colors of light to represent digital information. By changing the color of the transmitted signal, information can be encoded and decoded at the receiver. Next, we discuss how NOMA and CSK can be combined in VLC systems by using different power levels to represent different users. This allows for more efficient use of the frequency spectrum, as multiple users can share the same channel at the same time.

{"title": "Integrating Graceful Degradation and Recovery through Requirement-driven Adaptation", "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation. These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, to ensure that the system maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery.The key idea behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening an original (i.e., ideal) system requirement to be achieved by the system, and recovery as strengthening the weakened requirement when the environment returns within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL), we propose a run-time adaptation framework that automatically performs degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs).", "authors": "Simon Chu, Justin Koe, David Garlan, Eunsuk Kang", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

Typical to such missions is the design of transfer trajectories between desired targets. This is a complex and computationally expensive process.

One way to overcome this challenge is to use a reasonably approximate trajectory as an initial guess on optimal solvers. This paper presents a flexible approach to generating very low thrust trajectories. The initial guess is obtained from a flexible semi-analytic approach that can provide both planar and three-dimensional initial guess trajectories for various design scenarios like orbit raising, orbit insertion, phasing, and rendezvous.

Then, we study a joint beamforming design problem with the goal of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying the tag detection and communication requirements. To resolve this, we re-formulate the non-convex constraints into convex second-order cone constraints.

{"title": "Learning Hybrid Policies for MPC with Application to Drone Flight in Unknown Dynamic Environments", "abstract": "In recent years, drones have found increased applications in a wide array of real-world tasks. Model predictive control (MPC) has emerged as a practical method for drone flight control, owing to its robustness against modeling errors/uncertainties and external disturbances. However, MPC's sensitivity to manually tuned parameters can lead to rapid performance degradation when faced with unknown environmental dynamics. This paper addresses the challenge of controlling a drone as it traverses a swinging gate characterized by unknown dynamics. This paper introduces a parameterized MPC approach named hyMPC that leverages high-level decision variables to adapt to uncertain environmental conditions. To derive these decision variables, a novel policy search framework aimed at training a high-level Gaussian policy is presented. Subsequently, we harness the power of neural network policies, trained on data gathered through the repeated execution of the Gaussian policy, to provide real-time decision variables. The effectiveness of hyMPC is validated through numerical simulations, achieving a 100\\% success rate in 20 drone flight tests traversing a swinging gate, demonstrating its capability to achieve safe and precise flight with limited prior knowledge of environmental dynamics.", "authors": "Zhaohan Feng, Jie Chen, Wei Xiao, Jian Sun, Bin Xin, Gang Wang", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. To cope with such situations, model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive and introduce A-KIT, an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer to learn the varying process noise covariance online. The A-KIT framework is applicable to any type of sensor fusion. Here, we present our approach to nonlinear sensor fusion based on an inertial navigation system and Doppler velocity log.

Most available methods to calculate the pair-correlation from a particle configuration require that the configuration be very large to avoid effects from the boundary.

The Boltzmann transport equation is solved iteratively within the framework of three-phonon interactions without taking into account the four-phonon scattering process. The Umklapp and normal collisions are treated rigorously, thereby avoiding relaxation-time and long-wavelength approximations. The mechanisms of the failures of these approximations in predicting the thermal transport properties are discussed. Evaluation of the thermal conductivity is performed at different temperatures and frequencies and in different crystallite sizes. Reasonably good agreement with the experimental data is obtained. The calculation reveals a critical role of out-of-plane acoustic phonons in determining the thermal conductivity. The out-of-plane acoustic phonons contribute greatly and the longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons make small contributions over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies. The out-of-plane acoustic phonons dominate the thermal conductivity due to their high density of states and restrictions governing the anharmonic phonon scattering. The selection rule severely restricts the phase space for out-of-plane phonon scattering due to reflection symmetry. The optical phonon contribution cannot be neglected at higher temperatures. Both Umklapp and normal processes must be taken into account in order to predict the phonon transport properties accurately.", "authors": "J. Chen, Y. Liu", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "A Day-to-Day Dynamical Approach to the Most Likely User Equilibrium Problem", "abstract": "The lack of a unique user equilibrium (UE) route flow in traffic assignment has posed a significant challenge to many transportation applications. The maximum-entropy principle, which advocates for the consistent selection of the most likely solution as a representative, is often used to address the challenge. Built on a recently proposed day-to-day (DTD) discrete-time dynamical model called cumulative logit (CULO), this study provides a new behavioral underpinning for the maximum-entropy UE (MEUE) route flow. It has been proven that CULO can reach a UE state without presuming travelers are perfectly rational. Here, we further establish that CULO always converges to the MEUE route flow if (i) travelers have zero prior information about routes and thus are forced to give all routes an equal choice probability, or (ii) all travelers gather information from the same source such that the so-called general proportionality condition is satisfied. Thus, CULO may be used as a practical solution algorithm for the MEUE problem. To put this idea into practice, we propose to eliminate the route enumeration requirement of the original CULO model through an iterative route discovery scheme. We also examine the discrete-time versions of four popular continuous-time dynamical models and compare them to CULO. The analysis shows that the replicator dynamic is the only one that has the potential to reach the MEUE solution with some regularity.

{"title": "Performance Evaluation of a Full-Duplex UWA System in Lake Experiments", "abstract": "In this work we present a full-duplex (FD) underwater acoustic (UWA) communication system simultaneously transmitting and receiving acoustic signals in the same frequency bandwidth. To simplify the FD hardware, the system exploits a recently designed transducer capable of simultaneously transmitting and receiving signals. The key challenge of implementing an FD system is to cancel at the near-end receiver the strong self-interference (SI) from the near-end transmitter. By using advanced adaptive filtering algorithms providing high accuracy channel estimates, a high level of SI cancellation can be achieved when the far-end signal is absent. However, the SI channel estimation performance is limited in FD scenarios since the far-end signal acts as an interference when estimating the near-end SI channel. In this paper, we propose an FD UWA communication system which alternates between the SI cancellation and far-end data demodulation. An adaptive Rake combiner with multipath interference cancellation is implemented to improve the demodulation performance in time-varying multipath channels. The performance of the FD UWA system is evaluated in lake experiments. It is shown that the proposed adaptive Rake combiner with multipath interference cancellation significantly outperforms the conventional Rake combiner in all the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that, with the new Rake combiner, the detection performance of the proposed FD UWA system is comparable with that of the half-duplex system.", "authors": "Lu Shen, Benjamin Henson, Long Shi, Yuriy Zakharov", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

Offshore locations for wind turbines are increasingly exploited because of their numerous advantages. However, offshore wind farms require high investment in maintenance service. Due to its complexity and special requirements, maintenance service is usually outsourced by wind farm owners. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to determine, quantify, and reduce the possible conflicts of interest between owners and maintenance suppliers. We created a complete techno-economic model to address this problem from an impartial point of view. An iterative process was developed to obtain statistical results that can help stakeholders negotiate the terms of the contract, in which the availability of the wind farm is the reference parameter by which to determine penalisations and incentives. Moreover, a multi-objective programming problem was addressed that maximises the profits of both parties without losing the alignment of their interests. The main scientific contribution of this paper is the maintenance analysis of offshore wind farms from two perspectives: that of the owner and the maintenance supplier. This analysis evaluates the conflicts of interest of both parties.

{"title": "Potential Energy Landscape of a Flexible Water Model: Equation-of-State, Configurational Entropy, and Adam-Gibbs Relationship", "abstract": "The potential energy landscape (PEL) formalism is a tool within statistical mechanics that has been used in the past to calculate the equation of states (EOS) of classical rigid model liquids at low temperatures, where computer simulations may be challenging. In this work, we use classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the PEL formalism to calculate the EOS of the flexible q-TIP4P/F water model. This model exhibits a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in the supercooled regime, at ($P_c = 150$ MPa, $T_c = 190$ K, $\\rho_c = 1.04$ g/cm$^3$) [using the reaction field technique]. The PEL-EOS of q-TIP4P/F water, and the corresponding location of the LLCP, are in very good agreement with the MD simulations. We show that the PEL of q-TIP4P/F water is Gaussian which allows us to calculate the configurational entropy of the system, $S_{conf}$. The $S_{conf}$ of q-TIP4P/F water is surprisingly similar to that reported previously for rigid water models, suggesting that intramolecular flexibility does not necessarily add roughness to the PEL. We also show that the Adam-Gibbs relation, which relates the diffusion coefficient $D$ with $S_{conf}$, holds for the flexible q-TIP4P/F water model. Overall, our results indicate that the PEL formalism can be used to study molecular systems that include molecular flexibility, the common case in standard force fields. This is not trivial since the introduction of large bending/stretching mode frequencies is problematic in classical statistical mechanics. For example, as shown previously, we find that such high-frequencies lead to an unphysical (negative) entropy for q-TIP4P/F water (yet the PEL formalism can be applied successfully).", "authors": "Ali Eltareb, Gustavo E.

This paper uses causal machine learning methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in the case of an experimental study carried out in Morocco which evaluated the effect of conditionalizing a cash transfer program on school attendance compared to a labelled cash transfer. We show that there is little heterogeneity in effects with the average treatment effect across three different conditioning policies all being negative. We then explore if there are any variables in the dataset of 1936 pre-treatment variables that are particularly strong predictors of heterogeneity to try to understand this effect. While there are some variables we expected to be important here based on our theoretical framework, most are atheoretical variables whose effects are difficult to interpret. Household spending variables and child time-use variables are particularly important, however no variables have particularly large effects. The second purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and reflect upon a causal machine learning approach to policy evaluation. In this vein we suggest that findings that are difficult to interpret in this way are not surprising given the atheoretical methodology.

These results indicate that recently established models for the rheology of frictional, adhesive non-Brownian suspensions can be applied to fresh cement pastes, offering a new framework to understand the role of additives and fillers.

{"title": "Learning to be Homo Economicus: Can an LLM Learn Preferences from Choice", "abstract": "This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision aids, with a focus on their ability to learn preferences and provide personalized recommendations. To establish a baseline, we replicate standard economic experiments on choice under risk (Choi et al., 2007) with GPT, one of the most prominent LLMs, prompted to respond as (i) a human decision maker or (ii) a recommendation system for customers. With these baselines established, GPT is provided with a sample set of choices and prompted to make recommendations based on the provided data. From the data generated by GPT, we identify its (revealed) preferences and explore its ability to learn from data. Our analysis yields three results. First, GPT's choices are consistent with (expected) utility maximization theory. Second, GPT can align its recommendations with people's risk aversion, by recommending less risky portfolios to more risk-averse decision makers, highlighting GPT's potential as a personalized decision aid. Third, however, GPT demonstrates limited alignment when it comes to disappointment aversion.", "authors": "Jeongbin Kim, Matthew Kovach, Kyu-Min Lee, Euncheol Shin, Hector Tzavellas", "date": "14 Jan 2024"},

We bypass the common issue of having to carefully fine-tune a large traffic microsimulator by leveraging real-world trajectory data from the I-24 highway in Tennessee, replayed in a one-lane simulation. Using standard deep reinforcement learning methods, we train energy-reducing wave-smoothing policies. As an input to the agent, we observe the speed and distance of only the vehicle in front, which are local states readily available on most recent vehicles, as well as non-local observations about the downstream state of the traffic. We show that at a low 4% autonomous vehicle penetration rate, we achieve significant fuel savings of over 15% on trajectories exhibiting many stop-and-go waves. Finally, we analyze the smoothing effect of the controllers and demonstrate robustness to adding lane-changing into the simulation as well as the removal of downstream information.", "authors": "Nathan Lichtlé, Kathy Jang, Adit Shah, Eugene Vinitsky, Jonathan W.

{"title": "Spreading of Low-viscosity Ink Filaments Driven by Bath Viscoelasticity in Embedded Printing", "abstract": "Inks deposited in conventional direct ink writing need to be able to support their own weight and that of the upper layers with minimal deformation to preserve the structural integrity of the three-dimensional (3D) printed parts. This constraint limits the range of usable inks to high-viscosity materials. Embedded printing enables the use of much softer inks by depositing the materials in a bath of another fluid that provides external support, thus diversifying the types of 3D printable structures. The interactions between the ink and bath fluids, however, give rise to a unique type of defect: spreading of the dispensed ink behind the moving nozzle. By printing horizontal threads made of dyed water in baths of Carbopol suspensions, we demonstrate that the spreading can be attributed to the pressure field generated in the viscous bath by the relative motion of the nozzle. As the pressure gradient increases with the viscosity of the bath fluid while the viscosity of the ink resists the flow, a larger bath-to-ink viscosity ratio results in more spreading for low-concentration Carbopol baths. For high-concentration, yield-stress-fluid baths, we find that the steady-state viscosity alone cannot account for the spreading, as the elastic stress becomes comparable to the viscous stress and the bath fluid around the dispensed ink undergoes fluidization and resolidification. By parameterizing the transient rheology of the high-concentration Carbopol suspensions using a simple viscoelastic model, we suggest that the ink spreading is exacerbated by the elasticity but is mitigated by the yield stress as long as the yield stress is low enough to allow steady injection of the ink. These results help illuminate the link between the bath rheology and the printing quality in embedded 3D printing.", "authors": "Jae Hyung Cho, Emilie Dressaire", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Impermanent Loss Conditions: An Analysis of Decentralized Exchange Platforms", "abstract": "Decentralized exchanges are widely used platforms for trading crypto assets. The most common types work with automated market makers (AMM), allowing traders to exchange assets without needing to find matching counterparties. Thereby, traders exchange against asset reserves managed by smart contracts. These assets are provided by liquidity providers in exchange for a fee. Static analysis shows that small price changes in one of the assets can result in losses for liquidity providers. Despite the success of AMMs, it is claimed that liquidity providers often suffer losses. However, the literature does not adequately consider the dynamic effects of fees over time. Therefore, we investigate the impermanent loss problem in a dynamic setting using Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings indicate that price changes do not necessarily lead to losses. Fees paid by traders and arbitrageurs are equally important. In this respect, we can show that an arbitrage-friendly environment benefits the liquidity provider. Thus, we suggest that AMM developers should promote an arbitrage-friendly environment rather than trying to prevent arbitrage.", "authors": "Matthias Hafner, Helmut Dietl", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "A new model of trust based on neural information processing", "abstract": "More than 30 years of research has firmly established the vital role of trust in human organizations and relationships, but the underlying mechanisms by which people build, lose, and rebuild trust remains incompletely understood. We propose a mechanistic model of trust that is grounded in the modern neuroscience of decision making. Since trust requires anticipating the future actions of others, any mechanistic model must be built upon up-to-date theories on how the brain learns, represents, and processes information about the future within its decision-making systems. Contemporary neuroscience has revealed that decision making arises from multiple parallel systems that perform distinct, complementary information processing. Each system represents information in different forms, and therefore learns via different mechanisms. When an act of trust is reciprocated or violated, this provides new information that can be used to anticipate future actions. The taxonomy of neural information representations that is the basis for the system boundaries between neural decision-making systems provides a taxonomy for categorizing different forms of trust and generating mechanistic predictions about how these forms of trust are learned and manifested in human behavior. Three key predictions arising from our model are (1) strategic risk-taking can reveal how to best proceed in a relationship, (2) human organizations and environments can be intentionally designed to encourage trust among their members, and (3) violations of trust need not always degrade trust, but can also provide opportunities to build trust.", "authors": "Scott E.

To address this problem, we propose a QoS-aware UAV 3D coverage deployment algorithm, which simulates the three-dimensional urban road scenario, considers the UAV communication resource capacity and vehicle communication QoS requirements comprehensively, and then obtains the optimal UAV deployment position by improving the genetic algorithm. Specifically, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the vehicles, and the center locations of these clusters serve as the initial UAV positions to generate the initial population. Subsequently, we employ the K-means initialized grey wolf optimization (KIGWO) algorithm to achieve the UAV location with an optimal fitness value by performing an optimal search within the grey wolf population. To enhance the algorithm's diversity and global search capability, we randomly substitute this optimal location with one of the individual locations from the initial population. The fitness value is determined by the total number of vehicles covered by UAVs in the system, while the allocation scheme's feasibility is evaluated based on the corresponding QoS requirements. Competitive selection operations are conducted to retain individuals with higher fitness values, while crossover and mutation operations are employed to maintain the diversity of solutions. Finally, the individual with the highest fitness, which represents the UAV deployment position that covers the maximum number of vehicles in the entire system, is selected as the optimal solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the reliability and vehicle communication QoS.", "authors": "engfei Du, Tingyue Xiao, Haotong Cao, Daosen Zhai", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

Our scheme allows for multiple independently-managed areas within the DN to optimize their local resources while coordinating to support the TN, and while maintaining data privacy; the only required inter-area communication is between physically adjacent areas within the DN control hierarchy.

Some analyses of the Murchison CM2 meteorite suggest that at least some of the aluminum present within condensed as aluminum nitrides instead of the long studied, but heretofore undetected suite of aluminum oxides. The present theoretical study utilizes explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory and density functional theory to provide a pathway of formation from alane (AlH$_3$) and ammonia to the cyclic structure, Al$_2$N$_2$H$_4$ which has the proper Al/N ratio expected of bulk aluminum nitrides. Novel rovibrational spectroscopic constants are computed for alane and the first two formed structures, AlNH$_6$ and AlNH$_4$, along the reaction pathway for use as reference in possible laboratory or observational studies. The $\\nu_8$ bending frequency for AlNH$_6$ at 755.7 cm$^{-1}$ (13.23 $\\mu$m) presents a vibrational transition intensity of 515 km mol$^{-1}$, slightly more intense than the anti-symmetric C$-$O stretch of carbon dioxide, and contains a dipole moment of 5.40 D, which is $\\sim 3 \\times$ larger than that of water.

Transition disks (TDs) with large inner dust cavities are the ideal targets to study the inner tens of au of disks, as the central emission can be fully disentangled from the outer disk emission. We present a homogeneous multi-wavelength analysis of the continuum emission in a sample of 11 TDs. We investigate the nature of the central emission close to the star, distinguishing between thermal dust and free-free emission. Spatially resolved measurements of continuum emission from archival ALMA data are combined with literature cm-wave observations to study the spectral indices of the inner and outer disks separately. While the emission from the outer disks is consistent with thermal dust emission, 10/11 of the spectral indices estimated for the central emission close to the star suggest that this emission is free-free emission, likely associated with an ionized jet or a disk wind. No correlation between the free-free luminosity and the accretion luminosity or the X-ray luminosity is found, arguing against the photoevaporative wind origin. A sub-linear correlation between the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion rate onto the star is observed, suggesting an origin in an ionized jet. The relative lack of mm-dust grains in the majority of inner disks in transition disks suggests that either such dust grains have drifted quickly towards the central star, grain growth is less efficient in the inner disk, or grains grow rapidly to planetesimal sizes in the inner disk. The observed correlation between the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion rate suggests the outflow is strictly connected with the stellar accretion and that accretion in these disks is driven by a jet.", "authors": "Alessia A.

To help tap this information we have undertaken 2D polarized radiative transfer calculations to map out the possible landscape of type II SN continuum polarization (Pcont) from 20 to 300d after explosion. Our simulations are based on crafted 2D, axisymmetric ejecta constructed from 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer calculations for a red-supergiant star explosion. Following the approach used in our previous work on SN2012aw, we consider a variety of bipolar explosions in which spherical symmetry is broken by the presence, within ~30deg of the poles, of material with a higher kinetic energy (up to a factor of two) and higher 56Ni abundance (up to a factor of about five, with allowance for 56Ni at high velocity). Our set of eight 2D ejecta configurations produces considerable diversity in Pcont (~7000A), although its maximum of 1-4% occurs systematically around the transition to the nebular phase. Before and after that transition, Pcont may be null, constant, rising, or decreasing, which results from the complex geometry of the depth-dependent density and ionization as well as from optical depth effects. Our modest angle-dependent explosion energy can yield Pcont of 0.5-1% at early times. Residual optical-depth effects can yield an angle-dependent SN brightness and constant polarization at nebular times. Observed values of Pcont tend to be lower than obtained here, suggesting more complicated geometries with competing large-scale structures causing polarization cancellation.

The azimuthally averaged radial velocities of the magnetic elements and of the supergranular flow, calculated from a local correlation tracking technique applied to Dopplergrams, are very similar. This suggests that, in the long term, surface magnetic elements are advected by supergranular flows, although on short time scales their very chaotic motions are driven mostly by granular flows and other processes.", "authors": "D.

In situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft near perihelion suggest two shocks with the second one decayed, which is consistent with more than one eruptions in coronagraph images. Despite a flank crossing, the measurements indicate unique features of the young ejecta: a plasma much hotter than the ambient medium suggestive of a hot solar source, and a large plasma $\\beta$ implying a highly non-force-free state and the importance of thermal pressure gradient for CME acceleration and expansion. Reconstruction of the global coronal magnetic fields shows a long-duration change in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and the observed field polarity reversals agree with a more warped HCS configuration. Reconnection signatures are observed inside an HCS crossing as deep as the sonic critical point. As the reconnection occurs in the sub-Alfvénic wind, the reconnected flux sunward of the reconnection site can close back to the Sun, which helps balance magnetic flux in the heliosphere. The nature of the sub-Alfvénic wind after the HCS crossing as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL) leads to in situ measurements of the near subsonic plasma at a surprisingly large distance.

The consecutive occurrence of these two types of QFP wave trains in the same event provides an excellent opportunity to explore their excitation mechanisms and compare their physical parameters. Our observational results reveal that narrow and broad QFP wave trains exhibit distinct speeds, periods, energy fluxes, and relative intensity amplitudes, although originating from the same active region and being associated with the same {\\em GOES} C2.9 flare. Using wavelet analysis, we find that the narrow QFP wave train shares a similar period with the flare itself, suggesting its possible excitation through the pulsed energy release in the magnetic reconnection process that generated the accompanying flare. On the other hand, the broad QFP wave train appears to be associated with the energy pulses released by the successive expansion and unwinding of filament threads. Additionally, it is plausible that the broad QFP wave train was also excited by the sequential stretching of closed magnetic field lines driven by the erupting filament.

These template spectra often require extensive additional observing time to obtain, and they are not always feasible to obtain for faint stars. In this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning methods can be applied to infer stellar parameters and chemical abundances from iodine-imprinted spectra with high accuracy and precision. The methods presented in this work are broadly applicable to any iodine-cell-calibrated spectrograph.

{"title": "A two-dimensional perspective of the rotational evolution of rapidly rotating intermediate-mass stars", "abstract": "Recently, the first successful attempt at computing stellar models in two dimensions has been presented with models that include the centrifugal deformation and self-consistently compute the velocity field. This paper aims at studying the rotational evolution of 2D models of stars rotating at a significant fraction of their critical angular velocity. From the predictions of these models, we aim to improve our understanding of the formation of single Be stars. Using the ESTER code that solves the stellar structure of a rotating star in two dimensions with time evolution, we have computed evolution tracks of stars between 4 and 10Msun for initial rotation rates ranging between 60 and 90% the critical rotation rate. A minimum initial rotation rate at the start of the main sequence is needed to spin up the star to critical rotation within its main sequence lifetime. This threshold depends on the stellar mass, and increases with increasing mass. The models do not predict any stars above 8Msun to reach (near) critical rotation during the main sequence. Furthermore, we find the minimum threshold of initial angular velocity is lower for SMC metallicity compared to Galactic metallicity, which is in agreement with the increased fraction in the number of observed Be stars in lower metallicity environments. Self-consistent 2D stellar evolution provide more insight into the rotational evolution of intermediate-mass stars, and our predictions are consistent with observations of velocity distributions and fraction of Be stars amongst B-type stars. We find that stars with a mass above 8Msun do not increase their fraction of critical rotation during the main sequence. Since a fraction of stars above 8Msun have been observed to display the Be phenomenon, other processes or formation channels must be at play, or critical rotation is not required for the Be phenomenon above this mass.", "authors": "Joey S.

Past mid-IR spectra of bright high-mass protostars in the hot-core phase typically showed strong absorption features from molecules such as CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN. However, little is known about their fainter counterparts at earlier stages. We thus aim to characterize the gas-phase molecular features in JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the young high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053. Spectra were extracted from two mid-IR sources and three H$_2$ bright outflow knots in the MIRI/MRS field of view. Rich molecular spectra with emission from CO, H$_2$, HD, H$_2$O, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, and OH are detected towards the two mid-IR sources. However, only CO and OH are seen towards the brightest H$_2$ knots, suggesting that the majority of the observed species are associated with disks or hot core regions rather than outflows. Simple Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) slab models were used to fit the observed molecular features. The LTE model fits to $^{12}$CO$_{2}$, C$_{2}$H$_{2}$, and HCN emission suggest warm $120-200$ K emission arising from a disk surface around one or both protostars. Weak $\\sim500$ K H$_2$O emission at $\\sim$ 6-7 $\\mu$m is detected towards one mid-IR source, whereas $250-1050$ K H$_2$O absorption is found in the other. The H$_2$O absorption may occur in the disk atmosphere due to strong accretion-heating of the midplane, or in a disk wind viewed at an ideal angle for absorption. CO emission may originate in the hot inner disk or outflow shocks. OH emission is likely excited in a non-LTE manner through water photodissociation or chemical formation.

Our analysis uses chemical abundances from the most extensive dataset available for 126 planetary nebulae (PNe) with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainties from a 10x10 degree Galactic bulge region. By using argon as a superior PNe metallicity indicator, the anomaly is significantly reduced and better constrained. For the first time in PNe we show sulfur alpha-element lock-step with both oxygen and argon. We dispel hypotheses that the anomaly originates from underestimation of higher sulfur ionization stages. Using a machine learning approach, we show that earlier ionization correction factor (ICFs) schemes contributed significantly to the anomaly. We find a correlation between the sulfur anomaly and the age/mass of PNe progenitors, with the anomaly either absent or significantly reduced in PNe with young progenitors. Despite inherent challenges and uncertainties, we link this to PNe dust chemistry, noting those with carbon-dust chemistry show a more pronounced anomaly. By integrating these findings, we provide a plausible explanation for the residual, reduced sulfur anomaly and propose its potential as an indicator of relative galaxy age compositions based on PNe.", "authors": "Shuyu Tan, Quentin Parker", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Moreover, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) has been reported in prominences. Both waves and KHI may affect the thermodynamic state of the threads. We investigate the triggering of turbulence in a thread caused by the nonlinear evolution of standing torsional Alfvén waves as well as possible observational signatures of this dynamics and the plasma heating. We modeled the thread as a radially and longitudinally nonuniform cylindrical flux tube with a uniform axial magnetic field embedded in a coronal environment. We perturbed the flux tube with the longitudinally fundamental mode of standing torsional Alfvén waves and numerically solved the 3D MHD equations to study the temporal evolution in both ideal and dissipative scenarios. We also performed forward modeling to calculate the synthetic H{\\alpha} imaging. Standing torsional Alfvén waves undergo phase-mixing owing to the radially nonuniform density. The phase-mixing generates azimuthal shear flows that eventually trigger the KHI and, later, turbulence. If nonideal effects are included, plasma heating is localized in an annulus region at the thread boundary and does not increase the temperature in the cool core. Instead, the average temperature in the thread decreases owing to the mixing of internal and external plasmas. In the synthetic observations, first we find periodic pulsations in the H{\\alpha} intensity caused by the integration of the phase-mixing flows along the line of sight. Later, we find fine strands that may be associated with the KHI vortices. Turbulence can be generated by standing torsional Alfvén waves in a thread after the onset of KHI, but this mechanism is not enough to heat globally the structure.

The long-term multi-band optical light curves spanning twenty years revealed three repeated patterns, suggestive of a possible activity cycle of about ten years of the M dwarf.

The amplitude of the magnetic field is taken to be 10 Gauss, typical of the solar corona. We impose a Gaussian velocity pulse across this current sheet mimicking the interaction of fast magnetoacoustic waves with a current sheet in corona. This leads to a variety of dynamics and plasma processes in the current sheet, which is initially quasi-static. The initial pulse interacts with the current sheet and splits into a pair of counter-propagating wavefronts, which forms a rarefied region and leads to inflow and a thinning of the current sheet. The thinning results in Petschek-type magnetic reconnection followed by tearing instability and plasmoid formation. The reconnection outflows containing outward-moving plasmoids have accelerated motions with velocities ranging from 105-303 km/s. The average temperature and density of the plasmoids are found to be 8 MK and twice the background density of the solar corona, respectively. These estimates of velocity, temperature and density of plasmoids are similar to values reported from various solar coronal observations. Therefore, we infer that the external triggering of a quasi-static current sheet by a single velocity pulse is capable of initiating magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation in the absence of a localized enhancement of resistivity in the solar corona.", "authors": "Sripan Mondal, Abhishek K Srivastava, David I.

The goal of this work is to detect the characteristic properties of the Fourier and wavelet spectra evaluated for the time series of the fluctuating areas and radial magnetic fluxes of the active regions. Accordingly, this work gathers information on the properties of noise in the different cases considered. The AR area and radial magnetic flux time series were built using SHARP magnetogram datasets that cover nearly the entire time of the ARs' transits over the solar disk. Then we applied Fourier and wavelet analyses to these time series using apodization and detrendization methods for the cross-comparison of the results. These methods allow for the detection and removal of the artefact data edge effects. Finally, we used a linear least-squares fitting method for the obtained spectra on a logarithmic scale to evaluate the power-law slopes of the fluctuation spectral power versus frequency (if any). According to our results, the fluctuation spectra of the areas and radial magnetic fluxes of the considered ARs differ from each other to a certain extent, both in terms of the values of the spectral power-law exponents and their frequency bands. The characteristic properties of the fluctuation spectra for the compact, dispersed, and mixed-type ARs exhibit noticeable discrepancies amongst each other.

Our aim is to complete the compilation of rotation measurements toward more evolved stages, with a detailed analysis of the mean core rotation in core-helium burning giants. The asymptotic expansion for dipole mixed modes allows us to fit oscillation spectra of red clump stars and derive their core rotation rates.

We find that the evolution of the core rotation rate in core-helium-burning stars scales with the inverse square of the stellar radius, with a small dependence on mass. Assuming the conservation of the global angular momentum, a simple model allows us to infer that the mean core rotation and envelope rotation are necessarily coupled.

The rotational modulation and evolution of spots and/or faculae can induce variations in the RVs at the level of a few m/s in Sun-like stars. To overcome this, a multi-dimensional Gaussian Process framework has been developed to model the stellar activity signal using spectroscopic activity indicators together with the RVs. A recently published computationally efficient implementation of this framework, S+LEAF 2, enables the rapid analysis of large samples of targets with sizeable data sets. In this work, we apply this framework to HARPS observations of 268 well-observed targets with precisely determined stellar parameters. Our long-term goal is to quantify the effectiveness of this framework to model and mitigate activity signals for stars of different spectral types and activity levels.

We further analyze 39 WLFs among the identified WLFs and investigate their properties such as white-light enhancement, duration, and brightening area. It is found that the relative enhancement of the white-light emission at 360 nm is mostly (>90%) less than 30% and the mean enhancement is 19.4%.

As a pilot investigation, we focus on two specific cases: a gas giant and a sub-Neptune-sized planet, both orbiting a rapidly cooling WD with mass $M_\\ast$ = 0.6 \\msun\\ and separation $a$ = 0.02 AU. In both cases, the ensuing mass outflow rates exceed $10^{14}$ g sec$^{-1}$ for WD temperatures greater than $T_{\\rm WD} \\simeq$ 50,000 K. At $T_{\\rm WD} \\simeq$ 18,000 K [/22,000 K], the sub-Neptune [/gas giant] mass outflow rate approaches $10^{12}$ g sec$^{-1}$, i.e., comparable to the strongest outflows expected from close-in planets around late main-sequence stars. Whereas the gas giant remains virtually unaffected from an evolutionary standpoint, atmospheric escape may have sizable effects for the sub-Neptune, depending on its dynamical history, e.g., assuming that the hydrogen-helium envelope makes up 1 [/4] per cent of the planet mass, the entire envelope would be evaporated away so long as the planet reaches 0.02 AU within the first 230 [/130] Myr of the WD formation. We discuss how these results can be generalized to eccentric orbits with effective semi-major axis $a'=a/(1-e^2)^{1/4}$, which receive the same orbit-averaged irradiation. Extended to a much broader parameter space, this approach can be exploited to model the expected demographics of WD planets as a function of their initial mass, composition and migration history, as well as their potential for habitability.", "authors": "Elena Gallo, Andrea Caldiroli, Riccardo Spinelli, Francesco Haardt, Mary Anne Limbach, Juliette Becker, Fred Adams", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Effect of nuclear reactions rates and core boundary mixing on the seismology of red clump stars", "abstract": "Modeling of the stars in the red clump (RC) is challenging, due to the uncertainties associated with the physical processes happening in their core and during the helium flash. By probing the internal stellar structure, asteroseismology allows us to constrain the core properties of RC stars and eventually improve our understanding of this evolutionary phase. In this work, we aim to quantify the impact on the seismic properties of the RC stars of the two main core modeling uncertainties: core boundary mixing, and helium burning nuclear reaction rates. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we compute models with different core boundary mixing as well as different $3\\alpha$ and carbon alpha (C-alpha) nuclear reaction rates. We investigate the impact of those parameters on the period spacing $\\Delta \\Pi$, which is a probe of the region around the core. We find that different core boundary mixing schemes yield significantly different period spacings, with differences of 30s between the maximal $\\Delta \\Pi$ value computed with semiconvection and maximal overshoot. We show that increasing the rate of the C-alpha reaction lengthens the core helium burning phase, which extends the range of $\\Delta \\Pi$ covered by the models during their evolution. This results in a difference of 10s between the models computed with a nominal rate and a rate multiplied by 2, which is larger than the observational uncertainties. The effect of changing the 3$\\alpha$ reaction rate is comparatively small. In conclusion, the core boundary mixing is the main source of uncertainty regarding the seismic modeling of RC stars. Moreover, the effect of the C-alpha reaction rate is non-negligible, even if difficult to disentangle from the effect of the mixing. Such degeneracy could be raised in the future, thanks to new seismic data from the PLATO mission and theoretical constraints from numerical simulations.", "authors": "Anthony Noll, Sarbani Basu, Saskia Hekker", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP with SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI-HMI dataset currently spans the period between April 4, 1996, and December 13, 2022, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Time-lagged cross-correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of active regions lead the flare index in time.

We study the development of differential rotation near the convective core to test angular momentum transport processes that are typically adopted in stellar evolution models. Models that only include the advection of angular momentum by meridional circulation and shear instabilities cannot reproduce current rotational constraints, irrespective of the initial conditions. The latest formulation of internal magnetic fields based on the Tayler instability is indeed able to reproduce the internal rotation rate of post-main sequence stars, however, it appears too efficient during the main sequence and has thus been disfavoured. A less efficient version of the same transport process can simultaneously reproduce the rotation rate of the convective core, the rotation rate in radiative regions as probed by gravity-modes, and the surface rotational velocities of $\\gamma$ Doradus stars.

We also compared the physical structure and synthetic position-velocity (P-V) diagrams of the UCM model and a simple ballistic (SB) model. There are multiple ways to compare synthetic data with observational data. We first calculated the correlation coefficient. The UCM model and the SB model show similarly good correlation with the observational data. While the correlation reflects the overall similarity between the cube datasets, we can alternatively compare specific local features, such as the centrifugal barrier in the SB model or the centrifugal radius in the UCM model. We evaluated systematic uncertainties in these methods. In the case of L1527, the stellar mass values estimated using these methods are all lower than the value derived from previous Keplerian analysis of the disk. This may indicate that the gas infall motion in the envelope is retarded by, e.g., magnetic fields. We also showed analytically that, in the UCM model, the spin-up feature of the P-V diagram is due to the infall velocity rather than the rotation. The line-of-sight velocity $V$ is thus $\\propto x^{-0.5}$, where $x$ is the offset. If the infall is retarded, rotational velocity should dominate so that $V$ is proportional to $x^{-1}$, as is often observed in the protostellar envelope.", "authors": "Shoji Mori, Yuri Aikawa, Yoko Oya, Satoshi Yamamoto, Nami Sakai", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

We indicate that for less volatile liquids such as butanol, the flow pattern is dominated by capillary flow. With increasing liquid volatility, e.g., alcohol, the effect of evaporation cooling, under conditions, induces interfacial temperature gradient with cold droplet apex and warm edge. The temperature gradient leads to Marangoni flow that competes with outwarding capillary flow, resulting in the reversal of interfacial flow and the formation of a stagnation point near TPCL. The spatiotemporal variations of capillary velocity and Marangoni velocity are further quantified by mathematically decomposing the tangential velocity of interfacial flow.

Households that live or fall into the area of poverty are said to be in a poverty trap, where a poverty trap is a state of poverty from which it is difficult to escape without external help. Similarly, extreme poverty is considered as the most severe type of poverty, in which households experience severe deprivation of basic human needs. In this article, we consider an Omega risk process with deterministic growth and a multiplicative jump (collapse) structure to model the capital of a household. It is assumed that, when a household's capital level is above a certain capital barrier level that determines a household's eligibility for a capital cash transfer programme, its capital grows exponentially. As soon as its capital falls below the capital barrier level, the capital dynamics incorporate external support in the form of direct transfers (capital cash transfers) provided by donors or governments. Otherwise, once trapped, the capital grows only due to the capital cash transfers. Under this model, we first derive closed-form expressions for the trapping probability and then do the same for the probability of extreme poverty, which only depends on the current value of the capital given by some extreme poverty rate function. Numerical examples illustrate the role of capital cash transfers on poverty and extreme poverty dynamics.", "authors": "José Miguel Flores-Contró, Séverine Arnold", "date": "29 Nov 2023 ("},

Two hybrid modeling frameworks are presented for the vehicle dynamics. Five hybrid MPC controllers are then evaluated and extensively assessed on the fleet of vehicles. Finally, we comment on the need for new efficient and high performing distributed MPC schemes for hybrid systems.", "authors": "Samuel Mallick, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Covariance Function Estimation for High-Dimensional Functional Time Series with Dual Factor Structures", "abstract": "We propose a flexible dual functional factor model for modelling high-dimensional functional time series. In this model, a high-dimensional fully functional factor parametrisation is imposed on the observed functional processes, whereas a low-dimensional version (via series approximation) is assumed for the latent functional factors. We extend the classic principal component analysis technique for the estimation of a low-rank structure to the estimation of a large covariance matrix of random functions that satisfies a notion of (approximate) functional \"low-rank plus sparse\" structure; and generalise the matrix shrinkage method to functional shrinkage in order to estimate the sparse structure of functional idiosyncratic components. Under appropriate regularity conditions, we derive the large sample theory of the developed estimators, including the consistency of the estimated factors and functional factor loadings and the convergence rates of the estimated matrices of covariance functions measured by various (functional) matrix norms. Consistent selection of the number of factors and a data-driven rule to choose the shrinkage parameter are discussed. Simulation and empirical studies are provided to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the developed model and estimation methodology.", "authors": "Chenlei Leng, Degui Li, Hanlin Shang, Yingcun Xia", "date": "11 Jan 2024 ("},
{"title": "Non-Banking Sector development effect on Economic Growth. A Nighttime light data approach", "abstract": "This paper uses nighttime light(NTL) data to measure the nexus of the non-banking sector, particularly insurance, and economic growth in South Africa. We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic growth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection and optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good economic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted regressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and insurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP data collected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the nighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). From the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the insurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development in South Africa, and radiance light explained economic growth better than GDP and GDP/Capita. We concluded that nighttime data is a good proxy for economic growth than GDP/Capita in emerging economies like South Africa, where secondary data needs to be more robust and sometimes inflated. The findings will guide researchers and policymakers on what drives economic development and what policies to put in place. It would be interesting to extend the current study to other sectors such as micro-finances, mutual and hedge funds.", "authors": "Leonard Mushunje, Maxwell Mashasha", "date": "19 Nov 2023"},
{"title": "Robust flat bands in twisted trilayer graphene quasicrystals", "abstract": "Moiré structures formed by twisting three layers of graphene with two independent twist angles present an ideal platform for studying correlated quantum phenomena, as an infinite set of angle pairs is predicted to exhibit flat bands. Moreover, the two mutually incommensurate moiré patterns among the twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) can form highly tunable moiré quasicrystals. This enables us to extend correlated physics in periodic moiré crystals to quasiperiodic systems. However, direct local characterization of the structure of the moiré quasicrystals and of the resulting flat bands are still lacking, which is crucial to fundamental understanding and control of the correlated moiré physics. Here, we demonstrate the existence of flat bands in a series of TTGs with various twist angle pairs and show that the TTGs with different magic angle pairs are strikingly dissimilar in their atomic and electronic structures. The lattice relaxation and the interference between moiré patterns are highly dependent on the twist angles. Our direct spatial mappings, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal that the localization of the flat bands exhibits distinct symmetries in different regions of the moiré quasicrystals.", "authors": "Chen-Yue Hao, Zhen Zhan, Pierre A.

{"title": "Role of Elastic Phonon Couplings in Dictating the Thermal Transport across Atomically Sharp SiC/Si Interfaces", "abstract": "Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors have promising applications in power electronics due to their high voltages, radio frequencies, and tolerant temperatures. Among all the WBG semiconductors, SiC has attracted attention because of its high mobility, high thermal stability, and high thermal conductivity. However, the interfaces between SiC and the corresponding substrate largely affect the performance of SiC-based electronics. It is therefore necessary to understand and design the interfacial thermal transport across the SiC/substrate interfaces, which is critical for the thermal management design of these SiC-based power electronics. This work systematically investigates heat transfer across the 3C-SiC/Si, 4H-SiC/Si, and 6H-SiC/Si interfaces using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and diffuse mismatch model. We find that the room temperature ITC for 3C-SiC/Si, 4H-SiC/Si, and 6H-SiC/Si interfaces is 932 MW/m2K, 759 MW/m2K, and 697 MW/m2K, respectively. We also show the contribution of the ITC resulting from elastic scatterings at room temperature is 80% for 3C-SiC/Si interfaces, 85% for 4H-SiC/Si interfaces, and 82% for 6H-SiC/Si interfaces, respectively. We further find the ITC contributed by the elastic scattering decreases with the temperature but remains at a high ratio of 67%~78% even at an ultrahigh temperature of 1000 K. The reason for such a high elastic ITC is the large overlap between the vibrational density of states of Si and SiC at low frequencies (< ~ 18 THz), which is also demonstrated by the diffuse mismatch mode. It is interesting to find that the inelastic ITC resulting from the phonons with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency of Si (i.e., ~18 THz) can be negligible. That may be because of the wide frequency gap between Si and SiC, which makes the inelastic scattering among these phonons challenging to meet the energy and momentum conservation rules.", "authors": "Qinqin He, Yixin Xu, Haidong Wang, Zhigang Li, Yanguang Zhou", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

This allows us to recover the set and the type of connections between the agents in the network. We then use this information to recover the preferences and the consideration mechanisms of each agent. These nonparametric identification results allow for general forms of heterogeneity across agents and do not rely on the variation of either exogenous covariates or the set of available options (menus).

However, obtaining precise models is often prohibitively expensive, given their large scale and the ongoing nature of grid operations. To address this challenge, considerable efforts have been devoted to harnessing abundant consumption data for automatic model inference. The primary result of the paper is that, while the impedance of a line or a network can be estimated without synchronized phase angle measurements in a consistent way, the admittance cannot. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis is presented, quantifying the expected estimation errors of four prevalent admittance estimation methods. Such errors constitute fundamental model inference limitations that cannot be resolved with more data. These findings are empirically validated using synthetic data and real measurements from the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, confirming the theory.

Utilising the Faddeev-Jackiw method once more, we identify and classify all possible singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks, and we offer systematic solutions to them--a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantisation. Accordingly, the solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to nonlinear lumped-element networks. On the way, we naturally extend the canonical quantisation of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterisation of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, utilising continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We expect this work to become a useful tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantisation of superconducting networks.

We show that any ordinal voting method satisfying two well-known axioms from voting theory--positive involvement and the Condorcet winner criterion--refines the defensible set. Using this lemma, we prove an impossibility theorem: there is no such voting method that also satisfies the Condorcet loser criterion, resolvability, and a common invariance property for Condorcet methods, namely that the choice of winners depends only on the relative sizes of majority margins.", "authors": "Wesley H.

In this paper, an unconstrained DT-LPV-IO parameterization is developed which gives a stable model for any choice of model parameters. To achieve this, it is shown that \\textit{all} quadratically stable DT-LPV-IO models can be generated by a mapping of transformed coefficient functions that are constrained to the unit ball, i.e., a small-gain condition. The unit ball is then reparameterized through a Cayley transformation, resulting in an unconstrained parameterization of all quadratically stable DT-LPV-IO models. As a special case, an unconstrained parameterization of all stable DT linear time-invariant transfer functions is obtained. Identification using the stable DT-LPV-IO model with neural network coefficient functions is demonstrated on a simulation example of a position-varying mass-damper-spring system.", "authors": "Johan Kon, Jeroen van de Wijdeven, Dennis Bruijnen, Roland Tóth, Marcel Heertjes, Tom Oomen", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

Here, we address this gap by establishing universal lower and upper bounds for recurrence times in interacting spins. Notably, we investigate scenarios where these bounds are approached, shedding light on the speed of quantum processes under monitoring. In specific cases, our findings reveal that the complex many-body system can be effectively mapped onto a dynamical system with a single quasi-particle, leading to the discovery of integer quantized recurrence times.

Such task has remained formidable, with solutions often involving ad-hoc scalar and vectorial sets of materials properties, making optimization and transferability challenging. We extract representations directly from ab-initio differential electron charge density profiles using Neural Networks, highlighting the pivotal role of transfer learning in such task. Firstly, we demonstrate significant improvements in regression of a specific defected-materials property with respect to training a deep network from scratch, both in terms of predictions and their reproducibilities, by considering various pre-trained models and selecting the optimal one after fine-tuning. The remarkable performances obtained confirmed the transferability of the existent pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on physics domain data, very different from the original training data. Secondly, we demonstrate a saturation in the regression capabilities of computer vision models towards properties of an extensive variety of undefected systems, and how it can be overcome with the help of large language model (LLM) transformers, with as little text information as composition names. Finally, we prove the insufficiency of open-models, like GPT-4, in achieving the analogous tasks and performances as the proposed domain-specific ones.

The limiting distribution of those estimators is representable as the left derivative of the greatest convex minorant of a Gaussian process whose covariance kernel can be complicated and whose monomial mean can be of unknown order (when the degree of flatness of the function of interest is unknown). The standard nonparametric bootstrap is unable to consistently approximate the large sample distribution of the generalized Grenander-type estimators even if the monomial order of the mean is known, making statistical inference a challenging endeavour in applications. To address this inferential problem, we present a bootstrap-assisted inference procedure for generalized Grenander-type estimators. The procedure relies on a carefully crafted, yet automatic, transformation of the estimator. Moreover, our proposed method can be made ``flatness robust'' in the sense that it can be made adaptive to the (possibly unknown) degree of flatness of the function of interest. The method requires only the consistent estimation of a single scalar quantity, for which we propose an automatic procedure based on numerical derivative estimation and the generalized jackknife. Under random sampling, our inference method can be implemented using a computationally attractive exchangeable bootstrap procedure.

{"title": "Deep Learning With DAGs", "abstract": "Social science theories often postulate causal relationships among a set of variables or events. Although directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used to represent these theories, their full potential has not yet been realized in practice. As non-parametric causal models, DAGs require no assumptions about the functional form of the hypothesized relationships. Nevertheless, to simplify the task of empirical evaluation, researchers tend to invoke such assumptions anyway, even though they are typically arbitrary and do not reflect any theoretical content or prior knowledge. Moreover, functional form assumptions can engender bias, whenever they fail to accurately capture the complexity of the causal system under investigation. In this article, we introduce causal-graphical normalizing flows (cGNFs), a novel approach to causal inference that leverages deep neural networks to empirically evaluate theories represented as DAGs. Unlike conventional approaches, cGNFs model the full joint distribution of the data according to a DAG supplied by the analyst, without relying on stringent assumptions about functional form. In this way, the method allows for flexible, semi-parametric estimation of any causal estimand that can be identified from the DAG, including total effects, conditional effects, direct and indirect effects, and path-specific effects. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of Blau and Duncan's (1967) model of status attainment and Zhou's (2019) model of conditional versus controlled mobility.

{"title": "A Dynamic Agent Based Model of the Real Economy with Monopolistic Competition, Perfect Product Differentiation, Heterogeneous Agents, Increasing Returns to Scale and Trade in Disequilibrium", "abstract": "We have used agent-based modeling as our numerical method to artificially simulate a dynamic real economy where agents are rational maximizers of an objective function of Cobb-Douglas type. The economy is characterised by heterogeneous agents, acting out of local or imperfect information, monopolistic competition, perfect product differentiation, allowance for increasing returns to scale technology and trade in disequilibrium. An algorithm for economic activity in each period is devised and a general purpose open source agent-based model is developed which allows for counterfactual inquiries, testing out treatments, analysing causality of various economic processes, outcomes and studying emergent properties. 10,000 simulations, with 10 firms and 80 consumers are run with varying parameters and the results show that from only a few initial conditions the economy reaches equilibrium while in most of the other cases it remains in perpetual disequilibrium. It also shows that from a few initial conditions the economy reaches a disaster where all the consumer wealth falls to zero or only a single producer remains. Furthermore, from some initial conditions, an ideal economy with high wage rate, high consumer utility and no unemployment is also reached. It was also observed that starting from an equal endowment of wealth in consumers and in producers, inequality emerged in the economy. In majority of the cases most of the firms(6-7) shut down because they were not profitable enough and only a few firms remained. Our results highlight that all these varying outcomes are possible for a decentralized market economy with rational optimizing agents.", "authors": "Subhamon Supantha, Naresh Kumar Sharma", "date": "13 Jan 2024"},

We first show that the wild bootstrap Wald test, with or without using the cluster-robust covariance estimator, controls size asymptotically up to a small error as long as the parameters of endogenous variables are strongly identified in at least one of the clusters. Then, we establish the required number of strong clusters for the test to have power against local alternatives. We further develop a wild bootstrap Anderson-Rubin test for the full-vector inference and show that it controls size asymptotically up to a small error even under weak or partial identification in all clusters.

{"title": "A simple stochastic nonlinear AR model with application to bubble", "abstract": "Economic and financial time series can feature locally explosive behavior when a bubble is formed. The economic or financial bubble, especially its dynamics, is an intriguing topic that has been attracting longstanding attention. To illustrate the dynamics of the local explosion itself, the paper presents a novel, simple, yet useful time series model, called the stochastic nonlinear autoregressive model, which is always strictly stationary and geometrically ergodic and can create long swings or persistence observed in many macroeconomic variables. When a nonlinear autoregressive coefficient is outside of a certain range, the model has periodically explosive behaviors and can then be used to portray the bubble dynamics. Further, the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) of our model is considered, and its strong consistency and asymptotic normality are established under minimal assumptions on innovation. A new model diagnostic checking statistic is developed for model fitting adequacy. In addition two methods for bubble tagging are proposed, one from the residual perspective and the other from the null-state perspective. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to assess the performances of the QMLE and the two bubble tagging methods in finite samples. Finally, the usefulness of the model is illustrated by an empirical application to the monthly Hang Seng Index.", "authors": "Xuanling Yang, Dong Li, Ting Zhang", "date": "13 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Interaction robustness of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and Luttinger liquids from a mixed anomaly approach", "abstract": "The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets. However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$ whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems, this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.", "authors": "Shuyang Wang, Jay D. Sau", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

The Thouless energy, representing the energy scale at which the universal chaotic behavior in the energy spectrum ceases, can be determined from the spectrum itself. When simulating the SYK model on classical or quantum computers, it is advantageous to minimize the number of terms in the Hamiltonian by randomly pruning the couplings. In this paper, we demonstrate that even with a significant pruning, eliminating a large number of couplings, the chaotic behavior persists up to short time scales This is true even when only a fraction of the original $O(L^4)$ couplings in the fully connected SYK model, specifically $O(KL)$, is retained.

{"title": "Utilitarian Beliefs in Social Networks: Explaining the Emergence of Hatred", "abstract": "We study the dynamics of opinions in a setting where a leader has a payoff that depends on agents' beliefs and where agents derive psychological utility from their beliefs. Agents sample a signal that maximises their utility and then communicate with each other through a network formed by disjoint social groups. The leader has a choice to target a finite set of social groups with a specific signal to influence their beliefs and maximise his returns. Heterogeneity in agents' preferences allows us to analyse the evolution of opinions as a dynamical system with asymmetric forces. We apply our model to explain the emergence of hatred and the spread of racism in a society. We show that when information is restricted, the equilibrium level of hatred is determined solely by the belief of the most extremist agent in the group regardless of the inherent structure of the network. On the contrary, when information is dense, the space is completely polarised in equilibrium with the presence of multiple \"local truths\" which oscillate in periodic cycles. We find that when preferences are uniformly distributed, the equilibrium level of hatred depends solely on the value of the practical punishment associated with holding a hate belief. Our finding suggests that an optimal policy to reduce hatred should focus on increasing the cost associated with holding a racist belief.", "authors": "Houda Nait El Barj, Theophile Sautory", "date": "14 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Inference for Synthetic Controls via Refined Placebo Tests", "abstract": "The synthetic control method is often applied to problems with one treated unit and a small number of control units. A common inferential task in this setting is to test null hypotheses regarding the average treatment effect on the treated. Inference procedures that are justified asymptotically are often unsatisfactory due to (1) small sample sizes that render large-sample approximation fragile and (2) simplification of the estimation procedure that is implemented in practice. An alternative is permutation inference, which is related to a common diagnostic called the placebo test. It has provable Type-I error guarantees in finite samples without simplification of the method, when the treatment is uniformly assigned. Despite this robustness, the placebo test suffers from low resolution since the null distribution is constructed from only $N$ reference estimates, where $N$ is the sample size. This creates a barrier for statistical inference at a common level like $\\alpha = 0.05$, especially when $N$ is small. We propose a novel leave-two-out procedure that bypasses this issue, while still maintaining the same finite-sample Type-I error guarantee under uniform assignment for a wide range of $N$. Unlike the placebo test whose Type-I error always equals the theoretical upper bound, our procedure often achieves a lower unconditional Type-I error than theory suggests; this enables useful inference in the challenging regime when $\\alpha < 1/N$. Empirically, our procedure achieves a higher power when the effect size is reasonably large and a comparable power otherwise. We generalize our procedure to non-uniform assignments and show how to conduct sensitivity analysis. From a methodological perspective, our procedure can be viewed as a new type of randomization inference different from permutation or rank-based inference, which is particularly effective in small samples.", "authors": "Lihua Lei, Timothy Sudijono", "date": "13 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Dynamics of elongation of nematic tactoids in an electric field", "abstract": "Nematic tactoids are spindle-shaped droplets of a nematic phase nucleated in the co-existing isotropic phase. According to equilibrium theory, their internal structure and shape are controlled by a balance between the elastic deformation of the director field, induced by the preferred anchoring of that director field to the interface, and the interfacial free energy. Recent experiments on tactoids of chitin nanocrystals dispersed in water show that electrical fields can very strongly elongate tactoids, at least if the tactoids are sufficiently large in volume. However, this observation contradicts the predictions of equilibrium theory as well as findings from Monte Carlo simulations that do not show this kind of extreme elongation to take place at all. To explain this, we put forward a relaxational model based on the Oseen-Frank free energy of elastic deformation of a director field coupled to an anisotropic surface free energy. In our model, we use two reaction coordinates to describe the director field and the extent of elongation of the droplets, and evaluate the evolution of both as a function of time following the switching on of an electric field. Depending on the relative magnitude of the fundamental relaxation rates associated with the two reaction coordinates, we find that the aspect ratio of the drops may develop a large and very long-lived overshoot before eventually relaxing to the much smaller equilibrium value. In that case, the response of the curvature of the director field lags behind, explaining the experimental observations. Our theory describes the experimental data reasonably well.", "authors": "Mohammadamin Safdari, Roya Zandi, Paul van der Schoot", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Our results show that the magnitude of OAM is an order of magnitude larger than that of SAM, highlighting a stronger optical response from the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons compared to spin. Additionally, we observe a marked dependency of the oscillations of the x and y components on the helicity of the pulse. Intriguingly, left and right polarized pulses induce chirality in the precession of SAM and OAM, respectively, with clear associations with laser frequency and duration. Finally, we demonstrate that the time scale of OAM and SAM precession occurs even earlier than that of the demagnetization process and OISTR effect.

This note presents a simple and relatively fast two-step procedure to estimate the covariance matrix for parameters estimated with these algorithms. This procedure relies on automatic differentiation, a computational means of calculating derivatives that is popular in machine learning applications.

The causal machine learning literature has recently provided tools for estimating group average treatment effects (GATE) to understand treatment heterogeneity better. This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting such differences in treatment effects between groups while accounting for variations in other covariates. We propose a new parameter, the balanced group average treatment effect (BGATE), which measures a GATE with a specific distribution of a priori-determined covariates. By taking the difference of two BGATEs, we can analyse heterogeneity more meaningfully than by comparing two GATEs. The estimation strategy for this parameter is based on double/debiased machine learning for discrete treatments in an unconfoundedness setting, and the estimator is shown to be $\\sqrt{N}$-consistent and asymptotically normal under standard conditions. Adding additional identifying assumptions allows specific balanced differences in treatment effects between groups to be interpreted causally, leading to the causal balanced group average treatment effect.

Examples include moving expenses and regulatory fees. I establish that workers' costs lessen the response of unemployment to productivity changes and do not subtract from resources available for recruitment. The influence of workers' costs is bounded by properties of a matching function, which describes how job openings and unemployment produce hires. Using data on job finding that are adjusted for workers' transitions between employment and unemployment and for how the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey records hires, I estimate a bound that ascribes limited influence to workers' costs. The results demonstrate that costs paid by workers upon accepting jobs affect outcomes in the labor market (firms threaten workers with paying the up-front costs again if wage negotiations fail), but their influence on volatility is less important than firms' costs.", "authors": "Rich Ryan", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},

However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two.

Self-propulsion has a non-perturbative effect on the phase diagram, yielding novel phase behaviors depending on the type of aligning interactions. For aligning interaction that increase monotonically with the density, the tricritical point diverges to infinite density reproducing the standard scenario of a discontinuous flocking transition accompanied by traveling bands. In contrast, for models where the aligning interaction is non-monotonic in density, the system can exhibit either (the nonequilibrium counterpart of) an azeotropic point, associated with a continuous flocking transition, or a state where three phases coexist dynamically.", "authors": "Tal Agranov, Robert L.

In this contribution, we performed the multifractal analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained from a controlled multiple sclerosis (MS) study, focusing on the correlation between the degree of multifractality, disease duration, and disability level. Our results reveal a significant correspondence between the complexity of the time series and multiple sclerosis development, quantified respectively by scaling exponents and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Namely, for some brain regions, a well-developed multifractality and little persistence of the time series were identified in patients with a high level of disability, whereas the control group and patients with low EDSS were characterised by persistence and monofractality of the signals. The analysis of the cross-correlations between EEG signals supported these results, with the most significant differences identified for patients with EDSS $> 1$ and the combined group of patients with EDSS $\\leq 1$ and controls. No association between the multifractality and disease duration was observed, indicating that the multifractal organisation of the data is a hallmark of developing the disease.

This study leverages the divergent policies of Belgium and Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic to relax the unrealistic -- but persistently used -- assumption that social contacts are not influenced by an epidemic's dynamics. We develop an epidemiological-economic co-simulation model where pandemic-induced behavioral changes are a superposition of voluntary actions driven by fear, prosocial behavior or social pressure, and compulsory compliance with government directives. Our findings emphasize the importance of early responses, which reduce the stringency of measures necessary to safeguard healthcare systems and minimize ensuing economic damage. Voluntary behavioral changes lead to a pattern of recurring epidemics, which should be regarded as the natural long-term course of pandemics. Governments should carefully consider prolonging lockdown longer than necessary because this leads to higher economic damage and a potentially higher second surge when measures are released. Our model can aid policymakers in the selection of an appropriate long-term strategy that minimizes economic damage.", "authors": "Tijs W. Alleman, Jan M. Baetens", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Suppression of metal-to-insulator transition and stabilization of superconductivity by pressure in Re3Ge7", "abstract": "The effect of pressure on the low-temperature states of the Re3Ge7 is investigated by both electrical and Hall resistance and magnetization measurements. At ambient pressure, the temperature dependent resistance of Re3Ge7 behaves quasi-linearly from room temperature down to 60 K, then undergoes a two-step metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT) at temperatures T1 = 59.4 K and T2 = 58.7 K which may be related to a structural phase transition or occurrence of charge density wave ordering. Upon applying pressure, the two-step (T1, T2) MIT splits into three steps (T1, T2 and T3) above 1 GPa, and all traces of MITs are fully suppressed by ~8 GPa. Subsequently, the onset of bulk superconductivity (SC) occurs between 10.8 and 12.2 GPa and persists to our highest pressure of 26.8 GPa. At 12.2 GPa the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, and upper critical field, Hc2 reach the maximum of Tc (onset) ~5.9 K and Hc2 (1.8 K) ~ 14 kOe. Our results not only present the observation of SC under high pressure in Re3Ge7 but also delineate the interplay between SC and other competing electronic states by creating a T - p phase diagram for this potentially topologically nontrivial system Re3Ge7.", "authors": "S.

We also probe string inversion and entropy production processes across Coleman's phase transition through far-from-equilibrium quenches.

{"title": "Theory of excitonic polarons: From models to first-principles calculations", "abstract": "Excitons are neutral excitations that are composed of electrons and holes bound together by their attractive Coulomb interaction. The electron and the hole forming the exciton also interact with the underlying atomic lattice, and this interaction can lead to a trapping potential that favors exciton localization. The quasi-particle thus formed by the exciton and the surrounding lattice distortion is called excitonic polaron. Excitonic polarons have long been thought to exist in a variety of materials, and are often invoked to explain the Stokes shift between the optical absorption edge and the photo-luminescence peak. However, quantitative ab initio calculations of these effects are exceedingly rare. In this manuscript, we present a theory of excitonic polarons that is amenable to first-principles calculations. We first apply this theory to model Hamiltonians for Wannier excitons experiencing Fröhlich or Holstein electron-phonon couplings. We find that, in the case of Fröhlich interactions, excitonic polarons only form when there is a significant difference between electron and hole effective masses. Then, we apply this theory to calculating excitonic polarons in lithium fluoride ab initio. The key advantage of the present approach is that it does not require supercells, therefore it can be used to study a variety of materials hosting either small or large excitonic polarons. This work constitutes the first step toward a complete ab initio many-body theory of excitonic polarons in real materials.", "authors": "Zhenbang Dai, Chao Lian, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Exciton transport dominates over charge carrier transport for materials with high exciton binding energies and long ligands, such as halide perovskite nanocrystal films. Here, we investigate how beneficial superlattices - nearly perfect 3D nanocrystal assemblies of nanocrystals are to exciton transport. Surprisingly, the high degree of order is not as crucial as the individual nanocrystal size, which strongly influences the splitting of the excitonic manifold into bright and dark states. At very low temperatures, the energetic splitting is large for the smallest nanocrystals, and dark levels with low oscillator strength effectively trap excitons inside individual nanocrystals, suppressing diffusion. The effect is reversed at elevated temperatures, and the larger NC size becomes detrimental to exciton transport due to enhanced exciton trapping and dissociation. Our results reveal that the nanocrystal size must be strongly accounted for in design strategies of future optoelectronic applications.", "authors": "Andreas J. Bornschlegl, Michael F.

{"title": "Multiple temperatures and melting of a colloidal active crystal", "abstract": "Thermal fluctuations constantly and evenly excite all vibrational modes in an equilibrium crystal. As the temperature rises, these fluctuations promote the formation of defects and eventually melting. In active solids, the self-propulsion of \"atomic\" units provides another source of strong non-equilibrium fluctuations whose effect on the melting scenario is still largely unexplored. Here we show that when a colloidal crystal is activated by a bath of swimming bacteria, solvent temperature and active temperature cooperate to define dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Our system consists of repulsive paramagnetic particles confined in two dimensions and immersed in a bath of light-driven E. coli. The relative balance between fluctuations and interactions can be adjusted in two ways: by changing the strength of the magnetic field and by tuning activity with light. When the persistence time of active fluctuations is short, a single effective temperature controls both the amplitudes of vibrational modes and the melting transition. For more persistent active noise, energy equipartition is broken and multiple temperatures emerge, whereas melting occurs before the Lindemann parameter reaches its equilibrium critical value. We show that this phenomenology is fully confirmed by numerical simulations and can be framed within a minimal model of a single active particle in a periodic potential.", "authors": "Helena Massana-Cid, Claudio Maggi, Nicoletta Gnan, Giacomo Frangipane, Roberto Di Leonardo", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

In these notes, first, we obtain these explicit expressions by relying upon maximum entropy extremization à la Jaynes. Beyond providing a formal derivation of these recipes for Hebbian learning, this construction also highlights how Lagrangian constraints within entropy extremization force network's outcomes on neural correlations: these try to mimic the empirical counterparts hidden in the datasets provided to the network for its training and, the denser the network, the longer the correlations that it is able to capture. Next, we prove that, in the big data limit, whatever the presence of a teacher (or its lacking), not only these Hebbian learning rules converge to the original storage prescription of the Hopfield model but also their related free energies (and, thus, the statistical mechanical picture provided by Amit, Gutfreund and Sompolinsky is fully recovered).

{"title": "A Quantile Nelson-Siegel model", "abstract": "A widespread approach to modelling the interaction between macroeconomic variables and the yield curve relies on three latent factors usually interpreted as the level, slope, and curvature (Diebold et al., 2006). This approach is inherently focused on the conditional mean of the yields and postulates a dynamic linear model where the latent factors smoothly change over time. However, periods of deep crisis, such as the Great Recession and the recent pandemic, have highlighted the importance of statistical models that account for asymmetric shocks and are able to forecast the tails of a variable's distribution. A new version of the dynamic three-factor model is proposed to address this issue based on quantile regressions. The novel approach leverages the potential of quantile regression to model the entire (conditional) distribution of the yields instead of restricting to its mean. An application to US data from the 1970s shows the significant heterogeneity of the interactions between financial and macroeconomic variables across different quantiles. Moreover, an out-of-sample forecasting exercise showcases the proposed method's advantages in predicting the yield distribution tails compared to the standard conditional mean model. Finally, by inspecting the posterior distribution of the three factors during the recent major crises, new evidence is found that supports the greater and longer-lasting negative impact of the great recession on the yields compared to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "authors": "Matteo Iacopini, Aubrey Poon, Luca Rossini, Dan Zhu", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

As shown analytically and by solving numerically the coupled set of extended Gross-Pitaevski and Hartree-Fock equations for bosonic and fermionic components, respectively, roton instability mechanism leads to the formation of supersolid phase in a Bose-Einstein condensate.

We show that this objective is equivalent to the maximization by the firms of their eigenvector centrality in the production network. As is common in network formation games based on centrality, there are multiple Nash equilibria in our setting. We have investigated the characteristics and the social efficiency of these equilibria in a stylized version of our model representing international trade networks. We show that the impact of network structure on social welfare is firstly determined by a trade-off between costs of increasing process complexity and positive spillovers on productivity induced by the diversification of the input mix. We further analyze a variant of our model that accounts for the risks of disruption of supply relationships. In this setting, we characterize how social welfare depends on the structure of the production network, the spatial distribution of risks, and the process of shock aggregation in supply chains.

{"title": "Electron binding energy of donor in bilayer graphene with gate-tunable gap", "abstract": "In gapped bilayer graphene, similarly to conventional semiconductors, Coulomb impurities (such as nitrogen donors) may determine the activation energy of its conductivity and provide low temperature hopping conductivity. However, in spite of importance of Coulomb impurities, nothing is known about their electron binding energy $E_b$ in the presence of gates. To close this gap, we study numerically the electron binding energy $E_b$ of a singly charged donor in BN-enveloped bilayer graphene with the top and bottom gates at distance $d$ and gate-tunable gap $2\\Delta$. We show that for $10 < d < 200$ nm and $1 < \\Delta < 100$ meV the ratio $E_b/\\Delta$ changes from 0.4 to 1.5. The ratio $E_b/\\Delta$ stays close to unity because of the dominating role of the bilayer polarization screening which reduces the Coulomb potential well depth to values $\\sim \\Delta$. Still the ratio $E_b/\\Delta$ somewhat decreases with growing $\\Delta$, faster at small $\\Delta$ and slower at large $\\Delta$. On the other hand, $E_b/\\Delta$ weakly grows with $d$, again faster at small $\\Delta$ and slower at large $\\Delta$.

{"title": "Collective behavior of squirmers in thin films", "abstract": "Bacteria in biofilms form complex structures and can collectively migrate within mobile aggregates, which is referred to as swarming. This behavior is influenced by a combination of various factors, including morphological characteristics and propulsive forces of swimmers, their volume fraction within a confined environment, and hydrodynamic and steric interactions between them. In our study, we employ the squirmer model for microswimmers and the dissipative particle dynamics method for fluid modeling to investigate the collective motion of swimmers in thin films. The film thickness permits a free orientation of non-spherical squirmers, but constraints them to form a two-layered structure at maximum. Structural and dynamic properties of squirmer suspensions confined within the slit are analyzed for different volume fractions of swimmers, motility types (e.g., pusher, neutral squirmer, puller), and the presence of a rotlet dipolar flow field, which mimics the counter-rotating flow generated by flagellated bacteria. Different states are characterized, including a gas-like phase, swarming, and motility-induced phase separation, as a function of increasing volume fraction. Our study highlights the importance of an anisotropic swimmer shape, hydrodynamic interactions between squirmers, and their interaction with the walls for the emergence of different collective behaviors. Interestingly, the formation of collective structures may not be symmetric with respect to the two walls. Furthermore, the presence of a rotlet dipole significantly mitigates differences in the collective behavior between various swimmer types. These results contribute to a better understanding of the formation of bacterial biofilms and the emergence of collective states in confined active matter.", "authors": "Bohan Wu-Zhang, Dmitry A.

Although several deep learning networks (DNNs) demonstrate promising results in terms of segmentation, they require a substantial quantity of training data in order to produce suitable outcomes. Furthermore, a major issue faced by most of these models is their ability to perform well when faced with unseen classes. To address these challenges, we propose a one-shot learning model for segmenting brain tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, based on a single prototype similarity score. Leveraging the recently developed techniques of few-shot learning, which involve the utilization of support and query sets of images for training and testing purposes, we strive to obtain a definitive tumor region by focusing on slices that contain foreground classes. This approach differs from other recent DNNs that utilize the entire set of images. The training process for this model is carried out iteratively, with each iteration involving the selection of random slices that contain foreground classes from randomly sampled data as the query set, along with a different random slice from the same sample as the support set. In order to distinguish the query images from the class prototypes, we employ a metric learning-based approach that relies on non-parametric thresholds.

We propose to extend the frequency domain and introduce a Fourier transform that jointly encodes the spectral response of a signal for the two eigenbases from the polar decomposition. This allows us to define convolution following a standard routine. Our approach has two features: it is lossless as the shift operator can be fully recovered from factors of the polar decomposition.

In this paper, we present a universal US foundation model, named USFM, generalized to diverse tasks and organs towards label efficient US image analysis. First, a large-scale Multi-organ, Multi-center, and Multi-device US database was built, comprehensively containing over two million US images. Organ-balanced sampling was employed for unbiased learning. Then, USFM is self-supervised pre-trained on the sufficient US database.

Mitigating this concern necessitates the deployment and optimization of network energy-saving solutions, such as carrier shutdown, to dynamically manage network resources. Traditional optimization approaches encounter complexity due to factors like the large number of cells, stochastic traffic, channel variations, and intricate trade-offs. This paper introduces the simulated reality of communication networks (SRCON) framework, a novel, data-driven modeling paradigm that harnesses live network data and employs a blend of machine learning (ML)- and expert-based models. These mix of models accurately characterizes the functioning of network components, and predicts network energy efficiency and user equipment (UE) quality of service for any energy carrier shutdown configuration in a specific network. Distinguishing itself from existing methods, SRCON eliminates the reliance on expensive expert knowledge, drive testing, or incomplete maps for predicting network performance. This paper details the pipeline employed by SRCON to decompose the large network energy efficiency modeling problem into ML and expert-based submodels. It demonstrates how, by embracing stochasticity, and carefully crafting the relationship between such submodels, the overall computational complexity can be reduced and prediction accuracy enhanced.

A quick and accurate diagnosis is crucial to increase the chance of survival. However, in medical analysis, the manual annotation and segmentation of a brain tumor can be a complicated task. Multiple MRI modalities are typically analyzed as they provide unique information regarding the tumor regions. Although these MRI modalities are helpful for segmenting gliomas, they tend to increase overfitting and computation. This paper proposes a region of interest detection algorithm that is implemented during data preprocessing to locate salient features and remove extraneous MRI data. This decreases the input size, allowing for more aggressive data augmentations and deeper neural networks. Following the preprocessing of the MRI modalities, a fully convolutional autoencoder with soft attention segments the different brain MRIs.

The preamble of the communication signal is exploited in order to perform target sensing tasks, which involve detection and localization. The RIS in this case can aid the PR in sensing targets that are otherwise not seen by the PR itself, due to the many obstacles encountered within the propagation channel. Therefore, this work proposes a localization algorithm tailored for the integrated sensing and communications RIS-aided architecture, which is capable of uniquely positioning targets within the scene. The algorithm is capable of detecting the number of targets along with estimating the position of targets via angles and times of arrival.

This cooperation aims to achieve robust frequency restoration and proportional active power-sharing. It is shown that the in situ presence of a concealed auxiliary layer not only guarantees resilience against stealthy bounded attacks on both frequency and power-sharing but also facilitates a network-enabled attack identification mechanism. The paper provides rigorous proof of the stability of the closed-loop system and derives bounds for frequency and power deviations under attack conditions, offering insights into the impact of the attack signal, control and pinning gains, and network connectivity on the system's convergence properties.

Moreover, the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of speech have been ignored. In this paper, we propose a feature enhancement algorithm for dysarthria speech called WHFEMD. It combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) to enhance features. With the proposed algorithm, the fast Fourier transform of the dysarthria speech is first performed and then followed by EMD to get intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). After that, FWHT is used to output new coefficients and to extract statistical features based on IMFs, power spectral density, and enhanced gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted experiments on two public pathological speech databases including UA Speech and TORGO. The results show that our algorithm performed better than traditional features in classification. We achieved improvements of 13.8% (UA Speech) and 3.84% (TORGO), respectively. Furthermore, the incorporation of an imbalanced classification algorithm to address data imbalance has resulted in a 12.18% increase in recognition accuracy. This algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of the imbalanced dataset and non-linearity in dysarthric speech and simultaneously provides a robust representation of the local pathological features of the vocal folds and tracts.", "authors": "Ting Zhu, Shufei Duan, Camille Dingam, Huizhi Liang, Wei Zhang", "date": "30 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "Acceleration Estimation of Signal Propagation Path Length Changes for Wireless Sensing", "abstract": "As indoor applications grow in diversity, wireless sensing, vital in areas like localization and activity recognition, is attracting renewed interest. Indoor wireless sensing relies on signal processing, particularly channel state information (CSI) based signal parameter estimation. Nonetheless, regarding reflected signals induced by dynamic human targets, no satisfactory algorithm yet exists for estimating the acceleration of dynamic path length change (DPLC), which is crucial for various sensing tasks in this context. Hence, this paper proposes DP-AcE, a CSI-based DPLC acceleration estimation algorithm. We first model the relationship between the phase difference of adjacent CSI measurements and the DPLC's acceleration. Unlike existing works assuming constant velocity, DP-AcE considers both velocity and acceleration, yielding a more accurate and objective representation. Using this relationship, an algorithm combining scaling with Fourier transform is proposed to realize acceleration estimation. We evaluate DP-AcE via the acceleration estimation and acceleration-based fall detection with the collected CSI. Experimental results reveal that, using distance as the metric, DP-AcE achieves a median acceleration estimation percentage error of 4.38%. Furthermore, in multi-target scenarios, the fall detection achieves an average true positive rate of 89.56% and a false positive rate of 11.78%, demonstrating its importance in enhancing indoor wireless sensing capabilities.", "authors": "Jiacheng Wang, Hongyang Du, Dusit Niyato, Mu Zhou, Jiawen Kang, H.

The severity of hip OA is often classified using the Crowe and Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classifications. However, as the classification is subjective, we aimed to develop an automated approach to classify the disease severity based on the two grades using digitally-reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CT images. Automatic grading of the hip OA severity was performed using deep learning-based models. The models were trained to predict the disease grade using two grading schemes, i.e., predicting the Crowe and KL grades separately, and predicting a new ordinal label combining both grades and representing the disease progression of hip OA. The models were trained in classification and regression settings. In addition, the model uncertainty was estimated and validated as a predictor of classification accuracy. The models were trained and validated on a database of 197 hip OA patients, and externally validated on 52 patients. The model accuracy was evaluated using exact class accuracy (ECA), one-neighbor class accuracy (ONCA), and balanced accuracy.The deep learning models produced a comparable accuracy of approximately 0.65 (ECA) and 0.95 (ONCA) in the classification and regression settings. The model uncertainty was significantly larger in cases with large classification errors (P<6e-3). In this study, an automatic approach for grading hip OA severity from CT images was developed. The models have shown comparable performance with high ONCA, which facilitates automated grading in large-scale CT databases and indicates the potential for further disease progression analysis.

In recent years, deep learning-based methods for inverse problems have made remarkable progress and have become increasingly popular in CT reconstruction. However, most of these methods suffer several limitations: dependence on high-quality training data, weak interpretability, etc. In this study, we propose a fully unsupervised framework called Deep Radon Prior (DRP), inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP), to address the aforementioned limitations. DRP introduces a neural network as an implicit prior into the iterative method, thereby realizing cross-domain gradient feedback. During the reconstruction process, the neural network is progressively optimized in multiple stages to narrow the solution space in radon domain for the under-constrained imaging protocol, and the convergence of the proposed method has been discussed in this work.

Self-interest electric vehicle (EV) users, on the other hand, try to select a fast-EVCS for charging in a way to maximize their utilities based on electricity price, estimated waiting time, and their state of charge. While existing studies have largely focused on finding equilibrium prices, this study proposes a personalized dynamic pricing policy (PeDP) for a fast-EVCS to maximize revenue using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We first propose a multiple fast-EVCSs competing simulation environment to model the selfish behavior of EV users using a game-based charging station selection model with a monetary utility function. In the environment, we propose a Q-learning-based PeDP to maximize fast-EVCS' revenue. Through numerical simulations based on the environment: (1) we identify the importance of waiting time in the EV charging market by comparing the classic Bertrand competition model with the proposed PeDP for fast-EVCSs (from the system perspective); (2) we evaluate the performance of the proposed PeDP and analyze the effects of the information on the policy (from the service provider perspective); and (3) it can be seen that privacy-preserved information sharing can be misused by artificial intelligence-based PeDP in a certain situation in the EV charging market (from the customer perspective).", "authors": "Sangjun Bae, Balazs Kulcsar, Sebastien Gros", "date": "1 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Train-Free Segmentation in MRI with Cubical Persistent Homology", "abstract": "We describe a new general method for segmentation in MRI scans using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. It works in three steps, first identifying the whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the various components of the segmentation. Although convoking classical ideas of TDA, such an algorithm has never been proposed separately from deep learning methods. To achieve this, our approach takes into account, in addition to the homology of the image, the localization of representative cycles, a piece of information that seems never to have been exploited in this context. In particular, it offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for large annotated data sets. TDA also provides a more interpretable and stable framework for segmentation by explicitly mapping topological features to segmentation components. By adapting the geometric object to be detected, the algorithm can be adjusted to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We carefully study the examples of glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a sphere is to be detected, as well as myocardium in cardiac MRI, involving a cylinder, and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are circles.

The development of dispatch planning tools is mandatory to account for uncertainties associated with solar irradiation and electricity price forecasts as well as limited storage capacity. This study proposes the Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program (SMILP) to maximize expected profit within a specified scenario space. The SMILP scenario space is generated by different Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function percentiles of the potential solar energy to accumulate in storage and the expected profit is estimated using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. SMILP exhibits robust performance, however, its computational time poses a challenge. Thus, three heuristic solutions are developed which run a set of deterministic optimizations on different historical weather profiles to generate candidate dispatching plans (DPs). The candidate DP with the best average performance on all profiles is then selected. The new methods were applied to a case study for a 115 MW CST plant in South Australia. When the historical database has a limited set of historical weather profiles, the SMILP achieves 6% to 9% higher profit than the closest benchmark when the DP is applied to novel weather conditions. With a large historical weather data, the performance of SMILP and Heuristic-2 becomes nearly identical because the SMILP can only utilize a limited number of trajectories for optimization without becoming computationally infeasible. In this case, Heuristic-2 emerges a practical alternative, since it provides similar average profit in a reasonable time (saving about 7 hours in computing time).", "authors": "Navid Mohammadzadeh, Huy Truong-Ba, Michael E.

To alleviate the multi-hop attenuation, the semi-self sensing RIS approach is adopted, wherein sensors are configured at the RIS to receive the radar echo signal. Focusing on the estimation accuracy, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the direction-of-the-angles is derived as the metric for sensing performance. A joint optimization problem on hybrid beamforming and RIS phaseshifts is proposed to minimize the CRB, while maintaining satisfactory communication performance evaluated by the achievable data rate. The CRB minimization problem is first transformed as a more tractable form based on Fisher information matrix (FIM). To solve the complex non-convex problem, a double layer loop algorithm is proposed based on penalty concave-convex procedure (penalty-CCCP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method with two sub-problems. Successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and second order cone (SOC) constraints are employed to tackle the non-convexity in the hybrid beamforming optimization. To optimize the unit modulus constrained analog beamforming and phase shifts, manifold optimization (MO) is adopted. Finally, the numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed CRB minimization algorithm, and show the performance improvement compared with other baselines. Additionally, the proposed hybrid beamforming algorithm can achieve approximately 96% of the sensing performance exhibited by the full digital approach within only a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains.", "authors": "Wanting Lyu, Songjie Yang, Yue Xiu, Ya Li, Hongjun He, Chau Yuen, Zhongpei Zhang", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Interference Management in 5G and Beyond Networks", "abstract": "During the last decade, wireless data services have had an incredible impact on people's lives in ways we could never have imagined. The number of mobile devices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every year. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the explosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of growth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining various improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new technologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network densification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new waveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates significant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is essential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate severe and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and Beyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified classification and a detailed explanation of the different types of interference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference management approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports and signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth literature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes. We finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be encountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested new interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an AI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry in determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and will also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions.", "authors": "Nessrine Trabelsi, Lamia Chaari Fourati, Chung Shue Chen", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Pheme: Efficient and Conversational Speech Generation", "abstract": "In recent years, speech generation has seen remarkable progress, now achieving one-shot generation capability that is often virtually indistinguishable from real human voice. Integrating such advancements in speech generation with large language models might revolutionize a wide range of applications. However, certain applications, such as assistive conversational systems, require natural and conversational speech generation tools that also operate efficiently in real time. Current state-of-the-art models like VALL-E and SoundStorm, powered by hierarchical neural audio codecs, require large neural components and extensive training data to work well. In contrast, MQTTS aims to build more compact conversational TTS models while capitalizing on smaller-scale real-life conversational speech data. However, its autoregressive nature yields high inference latency and thus limits its real-time usage. In order to mitigate the current limitations of the state-of-the-art TTS models while capitalizing on their strengths, in this work we introduce the Pheme model series that 1) offers compact yet high-performing models, 2) allows for parallel speech generation of 3) natural conversational speech, and 4) it can be trained efficiently on smaller-scale conversational data, cutting data demands by more than 10x but still matching the quality of the autoregressive TTS models.

The tool serves to (i) construct IMCs/IMDPs as finite abstractions of underlying original systems, and (ii) leverage interval iteration algorithms for formal verification and controller synthesis over infinite-horizon properties, including safety, reachability, and reach-avoid, while offering convergence guarantees. IMPaCT is developed in C++ and designed using AdaptiveCpp, an independent open-source implementation of SYCL, for adaptive parallelism over CPUs and GPUs of all hardware vendors, including Intel and NVIDIA.

Microphone arrays have been employed for spatial analyses with an important objective being the estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of direct sound and early room reflections using room impulse responses (RIRs). An optimal method for DOA estimation is the multiple signal classification algorithm. When RIRs are considered, this method typically fails due to the correlation of room reflections, which leads to rank deficiency of the cross-spectrum matrix. Preprocessing methods for rank restoration, which may involve averaging over frequency, for example, have been proposed exclusively for spherical arrays. However, these methods fail in the case of reflections with equal time delays, which may arise in practice and could be of interest. In this paper, a method is proposed for systems that combine a spherical microphone array and a spherical loudspeaker array, referred to as multiple-input multiple-output systems.

Five ECG beats, including Normal Sinus Rhythm, Atrial Flutter, Atrial Fibrillation, 1st Degree Atrioventricular Block, and Left Atrial Enlargement, are included to study variations of P waves and PR Interval on Lead II and Lead V1. Q-Agent classified 71,672 beat samples in 8,867 patients with an average accuracy of 90.4% and only 9.6% average hamming loss over misclassification. The average classification time at the 100th episode containing around 40,000 samples is 0.04 seconds.

{"title": "Mapping Information in Feature Extraction Transformation for Chirp Signal", "abstract": "Chirp signals have established diverse applications caused by the capable of producing time-dependent linear frequencies. Most feature extraction transformation methods for chirp signals focus on enhancing the performance of transform methods but neglecting the information derived from the transformation process. Consequently, they may fail to fully exploit the information from observations, resulting in decreased performance under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio and limited observations. In this work, we develop a novel post-processing method called mapping information model to addressing this challenge. The model establishes a link between the observation space and feature space in feature extraction transform, enabling interference suppression and obtain more accurate information by iteratively resampling and assigning weights in both spaces. Analysis of the iteration process reveals a continual increase in weight of signal samples and a gradual stability in weight of noise samples. The demonstration of the noise suppression in the iteration process and feature enhancement supports the effectiveness of the mapping information model. Furthermore, numerical simulations also affirm the high efficiency of the proposed model by showcasing enhanced signal detection and estimation performances without requiring additional observations. This superior model allows amplifying performance within feature extraction transformation for chirp signal processing under low SNR and limited observation conditions, opens up new opportunities for areas such as communication, biomedicine, and remote sensing.", "authors": "Shuyi Gu, Zhenghua Luo, Lin Hu, Yilin Zhang, Junxiong Guo", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

Computed Tomography (CT) scanners can benefit from photon-counting detectors, which are new technology with the potential to overcome key limitations of conventional CT detectors. Researchers are still studying the effectiveness and sensitivity of semiconductor detector materials in photon counting detectors for detecting soft tissue contrasts. This study aimed to characterize the performance of the Cadmium Zinc Telluride photon counting detector in identifying various tissues. An optimal frame rate per second (FPS) of CZT detector was evaluated by setting the X-ray tube voltage and current at 25 keV, 35 keV and 0.5 mA, 1.0 mA respectively by keeping the optimum FPS fixed, the detector energy thresholds were set in small steps from 15 keV to 35 keV and the Currents were set for X-ray tubes in ranges of 0.1 mA to 1.0 mA to find the relationship between voltage and current of the X-ray source and counts per second (CPS). The samples i.e., fat, liver, muscles, paraffin wax, and contrast media were stacked at six different thickness levels in a stair-step chamber made from Plexi-glass. X-ray transmission at six different thicknesses of tissue samples was also examined for five different energy (regions) thresholds (21 keV, 25 keV, 29 keV, 31 keV, and 45 keV) to determine the effect on count per second (CPS). In this study, 12 frames per second is found to be the optimum frame rate per second (FPS) based on the spectral response of an X-ray source and CPS has a linear relationship with X-ray tube current as well. It was also noted that A sample's thickness also affects its X-ray transmission at different energy thresholds.

To avoid the cost of expensive data acquisition, researchers use the abundant data available on the internet.

Recent works such as CUDA propose solutions to this problem by adding class-wise blurs to make datasets unlearnable, i.e a model can never use the acquired dataset for learning. However these methods often reduce the quality of the data making it useless for practical applications. We introduce PosCUDA, a position based convolution for creating unlearnable audio datasets. PosCUDA uses class-wise convolutions on small patches of audio. The location of the patches are based on a private key for each class, hence the model learns the relations between positional blurs and labels, while failing to generalize.

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex cerebrovascular structure, the varying imaging quality, and vessel pathology effects. In this paper, we consider automatic lumen segmentation generation without additional annotation effort by physicians and more effective use of the generated lumen segmentation for improved centerline extraction performance. We propose an automated framework for brain vessel centerline extraction from CTA images. The framework consists of four major components: (1) pre-processing approaches that register CTA images with a CT atlas and divide these images into input patches, (2) lumen segmentation generation from annotated vessel centerlines using graph cuts and robust kernel regression, (3) a dual-branch topology-aware UNet (DTUNet) that can effectively utilize the annotated vessel centerlines and the generated lumen segmentation through a topology-aware loss (TAL) and its dual-branch design, and (4) post-processing approaches that skeletonize the predicted lumen segmentation. Extensive experiments on a multi-center dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average symmetric centerline distance (ASCD) and overlap (OV).

The majority of current methodologies are only applicable to a single and specific scenario, predicated on scenario-specific assumptions. Consequently, their application in real-world environments is restricted by the innumerable nature of traffic scenarios. In this study, we propose a unified optimization approach that exhibits the potential to address cooperative decision-making problems related to traffic scenarios with generic road topologies. This development is grounded in the premise that the topologies of various traffic scenarios can be universally represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Particularly, the reference paths and time profiles for all involved CAVs are determined in a fully cooperative manner, taking into account factors such as velocities, accelerations, conflict resolutions, and overall traffic efficiency. The cooperative decision-making of CAVs is approximated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem building on the DAGs of road topologies. This favorably facilitates the use of standard numerical solvers and the global optimality can be attained through the optimization. Case studies corresponding to different multi-lane traffic scenarios featuring diverse topologies are scheduled as the test itineraries, and the efficacy of our proposed methodology is corroborated.", "authors": "Zhenmin Huang, Shaojie Shen, Jun Ma", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

This environment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor sensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their control via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control (DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which implicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control. Our DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift from potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) with its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and feedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant stimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the brain.

{"title": "A gradient-based approach to fast and accurate head motion compensation in cone-beam CT", "abstract": "Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems, with their portability, present a promising avenue for direct point-of-care medical imaging, particularly in critical scenarios such as acute stroke assessment. However, the integration of CBCT into clinical workflows faces challenges, primarily linked to long scan duration resulting in patient motion during scanning and leading to image quality degradation in the reconstructed volumes. This paper introduces a novel approach to CBCT motion estimation using a gradient-based optimization algorithm, which leverages generalized derivatives of the backprojection operator for cone-beam CT geometries. Building on that, a fully differentiable target function is formulated which grades the quality of the current motion estimate in reconstruction space. We drastically accelerate motion estimation yielding a 19-fold speed-up compared to existing methods. Additionally, we investigate the architecture of networks used for quality metric regression and propose predicting voxel-wise quality maps, favoring autoencoder-like architectures over contracting ones. This modification improves gradient flow, leading to more accurate motion estimation. The presented method is evaluated through realistic experiments on head anatomy. It achieves a reduction in reprojection error from an initial average of 3mm to 0.61mm after motion compensation and consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. The analytic Jacobian for the backprojection operation, which is at the core of the proposed method, is made publicly available. In summary, this paper contributes to the advancement of CBCT integration into clinical workflows by proposing a robust motion estimation approach that enhances efficiency and accuracy, addressing critical challenges in time-sensitive scenarios.", "authors": "Mareike Thies, Fabian Wagner, Noah Maul, Haijun Yu, Manuela Meier, Linda-Sophie Schneider, Mingxuan Gu, Siyuan Mei, Lukas Folle, Andreas Maier", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

This work proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-aware threshold-based dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (T-DFSA) for contention resolution in random access machine-type communication networks. Unlike conventional DFSA that maximizes the throughput in each frame, the frame length and age-gain threshold in T-DFSA are determined to minimize the normalized average AoI reduction of the network in each frame. At the start of each frame in the proposed protocol, the common Access Point (AP) stores an estimate of the age-gain distribution of a typical node. Depending on the observed status of the slots, age-gains of successful nodes, and maximum available AoI, the AP adjusts its estimation in each frame. The maximum available AoI is exploited to derive the maximum possible age-gain at each frame and thus, to avoid overestimating the age-gain threshold, which may render T-DFSA unstable. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-DFSA compared to the existing optimal frame slotted ALOHA, threshold-ALOHA, and age-based thinning protocols in a considerable range of update generation rates.", "authors": "Masoumeh Moradian, Aresh Dadlani, Ahmad Khonsari, Hina Tabassum", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},

One of the major challenges faced by these approaches is the limited availability of ground truth labels. In the absence of ground truth, existing work usually adopts the \"direct transfer strategy\" that trains a classifier using historical labels collected from other regions and then applies the trained model to the target region. Unfortunately, the spectral features of crops exhibit inter-region and inter-annual variability due to changes in soil composition, climate conditions, and crop progress, the resultant models perform poorly on new and unseen regions or years. This paper presents the Crop Generative Adversarial Network (CropGAN) to address the above cross-domain issue. Our approach does not need labels from the target domain. Instead, it learns a mapping function to transform the spectral features of the target domain to the source domain (with labels) while preserving their local structure. The classifier trained by the source domain data can be directly applied to the transformed data to produce high-accuracy early crop maps of the target domain. Comprehensive experiments across various regions and years demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, many 3D surveys are still underexploited due to the lack of accessible and explainable automatic classification methods, for example, new topo-bathymetric lidar data. In this work, we introduce explainable machine learning for 3D data classification using Multiple Attributes, Scales, and Clouds under 3DMASC, a new workflow. This workflow introduces multi-cloud classification through dual-cloud features, encrypting local spectral and geometrical ratios and differences. 3DMASC uses classical multi-scale descriptors adapted to all types of 3D point clouds and new ones based on their spatial variations. In this paper, we present the performances of 3DMASC for multi-class classification of topo-bathymetric lidar data in coastal and fluvial environments. We show how multivariate and embedded feature selection allows the building of optimized predictor sets of reduced complexity, and we identify features particularly relevant for coastal and riverine scene descriptions. Our results show the importance of dual-cloud features, lidar return-based attributes averaged over specific scales, and of statistics of dimensionality-based and spectral features. Additionally, they indicate that small to medium spherical neighbourhood diameters (<7 m) are sufficient to build effective classifiers, namely when combined with distance-to-ground or distance-to-water-surface features. Without using optional RGB information, and with a maximum of 37 descriptors, we obtain classification accuracies between 91 % for complex multi-class tasks and 98 % for lower-level processing using models trained on less than 2000 samples per class.

Unlike transform-based codecs, which store coefficients in the transform domain, inpainting-based approaches store a small subset of the original image pixels and reconstruct the image from those by using a suitable inpainting operator. A good candidate for such an inpainting operator is homogeneous diffusion inpainting, as it is simple, theoretically well-motivated, and can achieve good reconstruction quality for optimized data. However, a major challenge has been to design fast solvers for homogeneous diffusion inpainting that scale to 4K image resolution ($3840 \\times 2160$ pixels) and are real-time capable. We overcome this with a careful adaptation and fusion of two of the most efficient concept from numerical analysis: multigrid and domain decomposition. Our domain decomposition algorithm efficiently utilizes GPU parallelism by solving inpainting problems on small overlapping blocks. Unlike simple block decomposition strategies such as the ones in JPEG, our approach yields block artifact-free reconstructions. Furthermore, embedding domain decomposition in a full multigrid scheme provides global interactions and allows us to achieve optimal convergence by reducing both low- and high-frequency errors at the same rate.

In this study, we explore unsupervised multimodal change detection between two key remote sensing data sources: optical high-resolution imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Specifically, we propose to utilize the vision foundation model Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), for addressing our task. Leveraging SAM's exceptional zero-shot transfer capability, high-quality segmentation maps of optical images can be obtained. Thus, we can directly compare these two heterogeneous data forms in the so-called segmentation domain. We then introduce two strategies for guiding SAM's segmentation process: the 'no-prompt' and 'box/mask prompt' methods. The two strategies are designed to detect land-cover changes in general scenarios and to identify new land-cover objects within existing backgrounds, respectively.

While various regional and connectivity features from functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been employed to develop diagnosis models, most studies integrate these features without adequately addressing their alignment and interactions. This limits the potential to fully exploit the synergistic contributions of combined features and modalities. To solve this gap, our study introduces a novel Hierarchical Alignments and Hierarchical Interactions (HA-HI) method for MCI and SCD classification, leveraging the combined strengths of fMRI and DTI. HA-HI efficiently learns significant MCI- or SCD- related regional and connectivity features by aligning various feature types and hierarchically maximizing their interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the interpretability of our approach, we have developed the Synergistic Activation Map (SAM) technique, revealing the critical brain regions and connections that are indicative of MCI/SCD.

{"title": "BreastRegNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Registration of Breast Faxitron and Histopathology Images", "abstract": "A standard treatment protocol for breast cancer entails administering neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical removal of the tumor and surrounding tissue. Pathologists typically rely on cabinet X-ray radiographs, known as Faxitron, to examine the excised breast tissue and diagnose the extent of residual disease. However, accurately determining the location, size, and focality of residual cancer can be challenging, and incorrect assessments can lead to clinical consequences. The utilization of automated methods can improve the histopathology process, allowing pathologists to choose regions for sampling more effectively and precisely. Despite the recognized necessity, there are currently no such methods available. Training such automated detection models require accurate ground truth labels on ex-vivo radiology images, which can be acquired through registering Faxitron and histopathology images and mapping the extent of cancer from histopathology to x-ray images. This study introduces a deep learning-based image registration approach trained on mono-modal synthetic image pairs. The models were trained using data from 50 women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent surgery. The results demonstrate that our method is faster and yields significantly lower average landmark error ($2.1\\pm1.96$ mm) over the state-of-the-art iterative ($4.43\\pm4.1$ mm) and deep learning ($4.02\\pm3.15$ mm) approaches.

{"title": "Multimodal Neuroimaging Attention-Based architecture for Cognitive Decline Prediction", "abstract": "The early detection of Alzheimer's Disease is imperative to ensure early treatment and improve patient outcomes. There has consequently been extenstive research into detecting AD and its intermediate phase, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there is very small literature in predicting the conversion to AD and MCI from normal cognitive condition. Recently, multiple studies have applied convolutional neural networks (CNN) which integrate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to classify MCI and AD. However, in these works, the fusion of MRI and PET features are simply achieved through concatenation, resulting in a lack of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal neuroimaging attention-based CNN architecture, MNA-net, to predict whether cognitively normal (CN) individuals will develop MCI or AD within a period of 10 years. To address the lack of interactions across neuroimaging modalities seen in previous works, MNA-net utilises attention mechanisms to form shared representations of the MRI and PET images. The proposed MNA-net is tested in OASIS-3 dataset and is able to predict CN individuals who converted to MCI or AD with an accuracy of 83%, true negative rate of 80%, and true positive rate of 86%. The new state of the art results improved by 5% and 10% for accuracy and true negative rate by the use of attention mechanism.

This property is exploited in inpainting-based image compression, which is a promising alternative to classical transform-based codecs such as JPEG and JPEG2000. However, optimizing the inpainting data is a challenging task. Current approaches are either quite slow or do not produce high quality results. As a remedy we propose fast spatial and tonal optimization algorithms for homogeneous diffusion inpainting that efficiently utilize GPU parallelism, with a careful adaptation of some of the most successful numerical concepts. We propose a densification strategy using ideas from error-map dithering combined with a Delaunay triangulation for the spatial optimization. For the tonal optimization we design a domain decomposition solver that solves the corresponding normal equations in a matrix-free fashion and supplement it with a Voronoi-based initialization strategy.

{"title": "Deep Blind Super-Resolution for Satellite Video", "abstract": "Recent efforts have witnessed remarkable progress in Satellite Video Super-Resolution (SVSR). However, most SVSR methods usually assume the degradation is fixed and known, e.g., bicubic downsampling, which makes them vulnerable in real-world scenes with multiple and unknown degradations. To alleviate this issue, blind SR has thus become a research hotspot. Nevertheless, existing approaches are mainly engaged in blur kernel estimation while losing sight of another critical aspect for VSR tasks: temporal compensation, especially compensating for blurry and smooth pixels with vital sharpness from severely degraded satellite videos. Therefore, this paper proposes a practical Blind SVSR algorithm (BSVSR) to explore more sharp cues by considering the pixel-wise blur levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we employed multi-scale deformable convolution to coarsely aggregate the temporal redundancy into adjacent frames by window-slid progressive fusion. Then the adjacent features are finely merged into mid-feature using deformable attention, which measures the blur levels of pixels and assigns more weights to the informative pixels, thus inspiring the representation of sharpness. Moreover, we devise a pyramid spatial transformation module to adjust the solution space of sharp mid-feature, resulting in flexible feature adaptation in multi-level domains. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both simulated and real-world satellite videos demonstrate that our BSVSR performs favorably against state-of-the-art non-blind and blind SR models.

A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for example the backprojection, to a convolutional neural network (CNN) which then computes the reconstruction.

As a consequence, they overfit to certain global structures which leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Moreover, their memory complexity and training time scale unfavorably with image resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical resolutions, especially in 3D: a standard U-Net requires a substantial 140GB of memory and 2600 seconds per epoch on a research-grade GPU when training on 1024x1024 images.

Though Raman suffers from weakness in intensity, Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), which uses metal nanostructures to amplify Raman signals, can achieve detection sensitivities that rival traditional photonic modalities. In this study, we outline a robotic Raman system that can reliably pinpoint the location and boundaries of a tumor embedded in healthy tissue, modeled here as a tissue-mimicking phantom with selectively infused Gold Nanostar regions. Further, due to the relative dearth of collected biological SERS or Raman data, we implement transfer learning to achieve 100% validation classification accuracy for Gold Nanostars compared to Control Agarose, thus providing a proof-of-concept for Raman-based deep learning training pipelines. We reconstruct a surgical field of 30x60mm in 10.2 minutes, and achieve 98.2% accuracy, preserving relative measurements between features in the phantom. We also achieve an 84.3% Intersection-over-Union score, which is the extent of overlap between the ground truth and predicted reconstructions. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the Raman system and classification algorithm do not discern based on sample color, but instead on presence of SERS agents. This study provides a crucial step in the translation of intelligent Raman systems in intraoperative oncological spaces.", "authors": "Ashutosh Raman, Ren A. Odion, Kent K.

{"title": "3D Beamforming Through Joint Phase-Time Arrays", "abstract": "High-frequency wide-bandwidth cellular communications over mmW and sub-THz offer the opportunity for high data rates, however, it also presents high pathloss, resulting in limited coverage. To mitigate the coverage limitations, high-gain beamforming is essential. Implementation of beamforming involves a large number of antennas, which introduces analog beam constraint, i.e., only one frequency-flat beam is generated per transceiver chain (TRx). Recently introduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true time delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam constraint by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams per TRx, for scheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division manner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with \"rainbow\" beams, which tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class focused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose frequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth or elevation direction. In this paper, we present a novel 3D beamforming codebook design aimed at maximizing beamforming gain to steer radiation toward desired azimuth and elevation directions, as well as across sub-bands partitioned according to scheduled users' bandwidth requirements. We provide both analytical solutions and iterative algorithms to design the PSs and TTD units for a desired subband beam pattern. Through simulations of the beamforming gain, we observe that our proposed solutions outperform the state-of-the-art solutions reported elsewhere.", "authors": "Ozlem Yildiz, Ahmad AlAmmouri, Jianhua Mo, Younghan Nam, Elza Erkip, Jianzhong, Zhang", "date": "1 Jan 2024"},

To help regain part of this autonomy, assistive robotic arms have been shown to increase living independence. However, users with paralysis pose unique challenging conditions for the control of these devices. In this article, we present the use of Diegetic Graphical User Interfaces, a novel, intuitive, and computationally inexpensive approach for gaze-controlled interfaces applied to robots. By using symbols paired with fiducial markers, interactive buttons can be defined in the real world which the user can trigger via gaze, and which can be embedded easily into the environment. We apply this system to pilot a 3-degree-of-freedom robotic arm for precision pick-and-place tasks. The interface is placed directly on the robot to allow intuitive and direct interaction, eliminating the need for context-switching between external screens, menus, and the robot. After calibration and a brief habituation period, twenty-one participants from multiple backgrounds, ages and eye-sight conditions completed the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) Block Pick and Place Protocol to benchmark the system, achieving a mean score of 13.71 out of the maximum 16.00 points. Good usability and user experience were reported (System Usability Score of 75.36) while achieving a low task workload measure (NASA-TLX of 44.76).

The continuous-function linear program is linked to existing probability-certifying barrier certificates of safety. Risk contours for initial conditions of the stochastic process may be generated by suitably modifying the objective of the continuous-function program, forming an interpretable and visual representation of stochastic safety for test initial conditions.

Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus exclusively on specific restoration or enhancement tasks, being insufficient in exploiting multi-image. Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios.

{"title": "Revisiting Nonlocal Self-Similarity from Continuous Representation", "abstract": "Nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) is an important prior that has been successfully applied in multi-dimensional data processing tasks, e.g., image and video recovery. However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for meshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging off-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit the NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel Continuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two innovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based on the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of self-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally suitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more compactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function factorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group and across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the similarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows our method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data processing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising) and off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery) validate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "authors": "Yisi Luo, Xile Zhao, Deyu Meng", "date": "1 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "DJCM: A Deep Joint Cascade Model for Singing Voice Separation and Vocal Pitch Estimation", "abstract": "Singing voice separation and vocal pitch estimation are pivotal tasks in music information retrieval. Existing methods for simultaneous extraction of clean vocals and vocal pitches can be classified into two categories: pipeline methods and naive joint learning methods. However, the efficacy of these methods is limited by the following problems: On the one hand, pipeline methods train models for each task independently, resulting a mismatch between the data distributions at the training and testing time. On the other hand, naive joint learning methods simply add the losses of both tasks, possibly leading to a misalignment between the distinct objectives of each task. To solve these problems, we propose a Deep Joint Cascade Model (DJCM) for singing voice separation and vocal pitch estimation. DJCM employs a novel joint cascade model structure to concurrently train both tasks. Moreover, task-specific weights are used to align different objectives of both tasks. Experimental results show that DJCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, with great improvements of 0.45 in terms of Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) for singing voice separation and 2.86% in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA) for vocal pitch estimation.

Neuro-motor conditions and co-occurring physical disabilities create difficulty in large-scale data collection for ASR system development. Adapting SSL pre-trained ASR models to limited dysarthric speech via data-intensive parameter fine-tuning leads to poor generalization. To this end, this paper presents an extensive comparative study of various data augmentation approaches to improve the robustness of pre-trained ASR model fine-tuning to dysarthric speech. These include: a) conventional speaker-independent perturbation of impaired speech; b) speaker-dependent speed perturbation, or GAN-based adversarial perturbation of normal, control speech based on their time alignment against parallel dysarthric speech; c) novel Spectral basis GAN-based adversarial data augmentation operating on non-parallel data.

The resulting distributed multi-object tracking algorithm involves solving an NP-hard multidimensional assignment problem either optimally for small-size problems or sub-optimally for general practical problems. For general problems, we propose an efficient distributed multi-object tracking algorithm that performs track-to-track fusion using a clustering-based analysis of the state space transformed into a density space to mitigate the complexity of the assignment problem. The proposed algorithm can more efficiently group local track estimates for fusion than existing approaches. To ensure we achieve globally consistent identities for tracks across a network of nodes as objects move between FoVs, we develop a graph-based algorithm to achieve label consensus and minimise track segmentation.

However, for KWS in continuous speech, co-articulation and streaming word segmentation can easily yield similar audio patterns for different texts, which may consequently trigger false alarms. To address this issue, we propose a novel CL with Audio Discrimination (CLAD) approach to learning keyword representation with both audio-text matching and audio-audio discrimination ability. Here, an InfoNCE loss considering both audio-audio and audio-text CL data pairs is employed for each sliding window during training. Evaluations on the open-source LibriPhrase dataset show that the use of sliding-window level InfoNCE loss yields comparable performance compared to previous CL approaches. Furthermore, experiments on the continuous speech dataset LibriSpeech demonstrate that, by incorporating audio discrimination, CLAD achieves significant performance gain over CL without audio discrimination.

It enables precise and detailed monitoring of operations, facilitating timely detection of potential hazards and efficient management. However, adverse weather conditions, such as atmospheric haziness and precipitation, can have a significant impact on image quality. When the atmosphere contains dense haze or water droplets, the incident light scatters, leading to degraded captured images. This degradation is evident in the form of image blur and reduced contrast, increasing the likelihood of incorrect assessments and interpretations by intelligent imaging systems (IIS). To address the challenge of restoring degraded images in hazy and rainy conditions, this paper proposes a novel multi-view knowledge-guided scene recovery network (termed MvKSR). Specifically, guided filtering is performed on the degraded image to separate high/low-frequency components. Subsequently, an en-decoder-based multi-view feature coarse extraction module (MCE) is used to coarsely extract features from different views of the degraded image. The multi-view feature fine fusion module (MFF) will learn and infer the restoration of degraded images through mixed supervision under different views.

We compute the uplink ergodic throughput of each scheduled user under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and non-orthogonal pilot signals. As maximum-radio combining is deployed locally at the ground gateway and the APs, the uplink ergodic throughput is obtained in a closed-form expression. The analytical results explicitly unveil the effects of channel conditions and pilot contamination on each scheduled user.

{"title": "Coding for Gaussian Two-Way Channels: Linear and Learning-Based Approaches", "abstract": "Although user cooperation cannot improve the capacity of Gaussian two-way channels (GTWCs) with independent noises, it can improve communication reliability. In this work, we aim to enhance and balance the communication reliability in GTWCs by minimizing the sum of error probabilities via joint design of encoders and decoders at the users. We first formulate general encoding/decoding functions, where the user cooperation is captured by the coupling of user encoding processes. The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding. For linear coding, we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability. We then propose an efficient algorithm for joint encoder/decoder design. For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding. Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance. We also demonstrate that our linear coding excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs. We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.", "authors": "Junghoon Kim, Taejoon Kim, Anindya Bijoy Das, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, David J.

A few efforts have been made to automatically diagnose AD in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using three-dimensional CNNs. However, due to the complexity of 3D models, the performance is still unsatisfactory, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To overcome the complexities of 3D images and 3D models, in this study, we aim to attack this problem with 2D vision Transformers. We propose a 2D transformer-based medical image model with various transformer attention encoders to diagnose AD in 3D MRI images, by cutting the 3D images into multiple 2D slices.The model consists of four main components: shared encoders across three dimensions, dimension-specific encoders, attention across images from the same dimension, and attention across three dimensions. It is used to obtain attention relationships among multiple sequences from different dimensions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) and multiple slices. We also propose morphology augmentation, an erosion and dilation based method to increase the structural difference between AD and normal images. In this experiment, we use multiple datasets from ADNI, AIBL, MIRAID, OASIS to show the performance of our model. Our proposed MedTransformer demonstrates a strong ability in diagnosing AD. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of MedTransformer in learning from 3D data using a much smaller model and its capability to generalize among different medical tasks, which provides a possibility to help doctors diagnose AD in a simpler way.", "authors": "Yifeng Wang, Ke Chen, Yihan Zhang, Haohan Wang", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},

However, 30-40% of these trials fail mainly because such studies have inadequate sample sizes, stemming from the inability to obtain accurate initial estimates of average treatment effect parameters. To remove this obstacle from the drug development cycle, we present a new algorithm called Trend-Adaptive Design with a Synthetic-Intervention-Based Estimator (TAD-SIE) that appropriately powers a parallel-group trial, a standard RCT design, by leveraging a state-of-the-art hypothesis testing strategy and a novel trend-adaptive design (TAD). Specifically, TAD-SIE uses SECRETS (Subject-Efficient Clinical Randomized Controlled Trials using Synthetic Intervention) for hypothesis testing, which simulates a cross-over trial in order to boost power; doing so, makes it easier for a trial to reach target power within trial constraints (e.g., sample size limits). To estimate sample sizes, TAD-SIE implements a new TAD tailored to SECRETS given that SECRETS violates assumptions under standard TADs. In addition, our TAD overcomes the ineffectiveness of standard TADs by allowing sample sizes to be increased across iterations without any condition while controlling significance level with futility stopping. On a real-world Phase-3 clinical RCT (i.e., a two-arm parallel-group superiority trial with an equal number of subjects per arm), TAD-SIE reaches typical target operating points of 80% or 90% power and 5% significance level in contrast to baseline algorithms that only get at best 59% power and 4% significance level.", "authors": "Sayeri Lala, Niraj K.

{"title": "Exploiting Storage for Computing: Computation Reuse in Collaborative Edge Computing", "abstract": "Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) is a new edge computing paradigm that enables neighboring edge servers to share computational resources with each other. Although CEC can enhance the utilization of computational resources, it still suffers from resource waste. The primary reason is that end-users from the same area are likely to offload similar tasks to edge servers, thereby leading to duplicate computations. To improve system efficiency, the computation results of previously executed tasks can be cached and then reused by subsequent tasks. However, most existing computation reuse algorithms only consider one edge server, which significantly limits the effectiveness of computation reuse. To address this issue, this paper applies computation reuse in CEC networks to exploit the collaboration among edge servers. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to minimize the overall task response time and decompose it into a caching subproblem and a scheduling subproblem. By analyzing the properties of optimal solutions, we show that the optimal caching decisions can be efficiently searched using the bisection method. For the scheduling subproblem, we utilize projected gradient descent and backtracking to find a local minimum.

{"title": "Faster ISNet for Background Bias Mitigation on Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Image background features can constitute background bias (spurious correlations) and impact deep classifiers decisions, causing shortcut learning (Clever Hans effect) and reducing the generalization skill on real-world data. The concept of optimizing Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) heatmaps, to improve classifier behavior, was recently introduced by a neural network architecture named ISNet. It minimizes background relevance in LRP maps, to mitigate the influence of image background features on deep classifiers decisions, hindering shortcut learning and improving generalization. For each training image, the original ISNet produces one heatmap per possible class in the classification task, hence, its training time scales linearly with the number of classes. Here, we introduce reformulated architectures that allow the training time to become independent from this number, rendering the optimization process much faster. We challenged the enhanced models utilizing the MNIST dataset with synthetic background bias, and COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, an application that is prone to shortcut learning due to background bias. The trained models minimized background attention and hindered shortcut learning, while retaining high accuracy.

Numerous studies demonstrate that children diagnosed with autism struggle with maintaining attention spans and have less focused vision. The eye-tracking technology has drawn special attention in the context of ASD since anomalies in gaze have long been acknowledged as a defining feature of autism in general. Deep Learning (DL) approaches coupled with eye-tracking sensors are exploiting additional capabilities to advance the diagnostic and its applications. By learning intricate nonlinear input-output relations, DL can accurately recognize the various gaze and eye-tracking patterns and adjust to the data. Convolutions alone are insufficient to capture the important spatial information in gaze patterns or eye tracking. The dynamic kernel-based process known as involutions can improve the efficiency of classifying gaze patterns or eye tracking data. In this paper, we utilise two different image-processing operations to see how these processes learn eye-tracking patterns. Since these patterns are primarily based on spatial information, we use involution with convolution making it a hybrid, which adds location-specific capability to a deep learning model. Our proposed model is implemented in a simple yet effective approach, which makes it easier for applying in real life.

Meanwhile, the heterogeneous nature and imbalanced data abundance of different languages may cause performance degradation, leading to asynchronous peak performance for different languages during training, especially on tail ones. Sometimes even the data itself may become unavailable as a result of the enhanced privacy protection. Existing work tend to significantly increase the model size or learn language-specific decoders to accommodate each language separately. In this study, we explore simple yet effective Language-Dependent Adapter (LDA) finetuning under a cascaded Conformer transducer framework enhanced by teacher pseudo-labeling for tail languages in the streaming multilingual ASR. The adapter only accounts for 0.4% of the full model per language. It is plugged into the frozen foundation model and is the only trainable module during the finetuning process with noisy student training. The final model merges the adapter parameters from different checkpoints for different languages. The model performance is validated on a challenging multilingual dictation dataset, which includes 39 tail languages across Latin, Greek, Arabic, etc. Our proposed method brings 12.2% word error rate reduction on average and up to 37.5% on a single locale.

{"title": "Segmentation of Mediastinal Lymph Nodes in CT with Anatomical Priors", "abstract": "Purpose: Lymph nodes (LNs) in the chest have a tendency to enlarge due to various pathologies, such as lung cancer or pneumonia. Clinicians routinely measure nodal size to monitor disease progression, confirm metastatic cancer, and assess treatment response. However, variations in their shapes and appearances make it cumbersome to identify LNs, which reside outside of most organs. Methods: We propose to segment LNs in the mediastinum by leveraging the anatomical priors of 28 different structures (e.g., lung, trachea etc.) generated by the public TotalSegmentator tool. The CT volumes from 89 patients available in the public NIH CT Lymph Node dataset were used to train three 3D nnUNet models to segment LNs. The public St. Olavs dataset containing 15 patients (out-of-training-distribution) was used to evaluate the segmentation performance. Results: For the 15 test patients, the 3D cascade nnUNet model obtained the highest Dice score of 72.2 +- 22.3 for mediastinal LNs with short axis diameter $\\geq$ 8mm and 54.8 +- 23.8 for all LNs respectively. These results represent an improvement of 10 points over a current approach that was evaluated on the same test dataset. Conclusion: To our knowledge, we are the first to harness 28 distinct anatomical priors to segment mediastinal LNs, and our work can be extended to other nodal zones in the body.

Leveraging optical computing, this paper develops an on-chip training framework for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), aiming to solve high-dimensional PDEs with fJ/MAC photonic power consumption and ultra-low latency. Despite the ultra-high speed of optical neural networks, training a PINN on an optical chip is hard due to (1) the large size of photonic devices, and (2) the lack of scalable optical memory devices to store the intermediate results of back-propagation (BP). To enable realistic optical PINN training, this paper presents a scalable method to avoid the BP process. We also employ a tensor-compressed approach to improve the convergence and scalability of our optical PINN training. This training framework is designed with tensorized optical neural networks (TONN) for scalable inference acceleration and MZI phase-domain tuning for \\textit{in-situ} optimization. Our simulation results of a 20-dim HJB PDE show that our photonic accelerator can reduce the number of MZIs by a factor of $1.17\\times 10^3$, with only $1.36$ J and $1.15$ s to solve this equation. This is the first real-size optical PINN training framework that can be applied to solve high-dimensional PDEs.", "authors": "Yequan Zhao, Xian Xiao, Xinling Yu, Ziyue Liu, Zhixiong Chen, Geza Kurczveil, Raymond G.

{"title": "Leveraging Frequency Domain Learning in 3D Vessel Segmentation", "abstract": "Coronary microvascular disease constitutes a substantial risk to human health. Employing computer-aided analysis and diagnostic systems, medical professionals can intervene early in disease progression, with 3D vessel segmentation serving as a crucial component. Nevertheless, conventional U-Net architectures tend to yield incoherent and imprecise segmentation outcomes, particularly for small vessel structures. While models with attention mechanisms, such as Transformers and large convolutional kernels, demonstrate superior performance, their extensive computational demands during training and inference lead to increased time complexity. In this study, we leverage Fourier domain learning as a substitute for multi-scale convolutional kernels in 3D hierarchical segmentation models, which can reduce computational expenses while preserving global receptive fields within the network. Furthermore, a zero-parameter frequency domain fusion method is designed to improve the skip connections in U-Net architecture. Experimental results on a public dataset and an in-house dataset indicate that our novel Fourier transformation-based network achieves remarkable dice performance (84.37\\% on ASACA500 and 80.32\\% on ImageCAS) in tubular vessel segmentation tasks and substantially reduces computational requirements without compromising global receptive fields.", "authors": "Xinyuan Wang, Chengwei Pan, Hongming Dai, Gangming Zhao, Jinpeng Li, Xiao Zhang, Yizhou Yu", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Generative Model-Driven Synthetic Training Image Generation: An Approach to Cognition in Rail Defect Detection", "abstract": "Recent advancements in cognitive computing, with the integration of deep learning techniques, have facilitated the development of intelligent cognitive systems (ICS). This is particularly beneficial in the context of rail defect detection, where the ICS would emulate human-like analysis of image data for defect patterns. Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in visual defect classification, the scarcity of large datasets for rail defect detection remains a challenge due to infrequent accident events that would result in defective parts and images. Contemporary researchers have addressed this data scarcity challenge by exploring rule-based and generative data augmentation models. Among these, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models can generate realistic data without extensive baseline datasets for noise modeling. This study proposes a VAE-based synthetic image generation technique for rail defects, incorporating weight decay regularization and image reconstruction loss to prevent overfitting. The proposed method is applied to create a synthetic dataset for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) with just 50 real samples across five classes. Remarkably, 500 synthetic samples are generated with a minimal reconstruction loss of 0.021. A Visual Transformer (ViT) model underwent fine-tuning using this synthetic CPR dataset, achieving high accuracy rates (98%-99%) in classifying the five defect classes. This research offers a promising solution to the data scarcity challenge in rail defect detection, showcasing the potential for robust ICS development in this domain.", "authors": "Rahatara Ferdousi, Chunsheng Yang, M.

The complexity arises as a single optical data can have multiple SAR representations based on the SAR viewing geometry. We propose a novel approach, termed SAR Temporal Shifting, which inputs an optical data from the desired timestamp along with a SAR data from a different temporal point but with a consistent viewing geometry as the expected SAR data, both complemented with a change map of optical data during the intervening period. This model modifies the SAR data based on the changes observed in optical data to generate the SAR data for the desired timestamp. Our model, a dual conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named Temporal Shifting GAN (TSGAN), incorporates a siamese encoder in both the Generator and the Discriminator. To prevent the model from overfitting on the input SAR data, we employed a change weighted loss function. Our approach surpasses traditional translation methods by eliminating the GAN's fiction phenomenon, particularly in unchanged regions, resulting in higher SSIM and PSNR in these areas. Additionally, modifications to the Pix2Pix architecture and the inclusion of attention mechanisms have enhanced the model's performance on all regions of the data. This research paves the way for leveraging legacy optical datasets, the most abundant and longstanding source of Earth imagery data, extending their use to SAR domains and temporal analyses.

{"title": "UGPNet: Universal Generative Prior for Image Restoration", "abstract": "Recent image restoration methods can be broadly categorized into two classes: (1) regression methods that recover the rough structure of the original image without synthesizing high-frequency details and (2) generative methods that synthesize perceptually-realistic high-frequency details even though the resulting image deviates from the original structure of the input. While both directions have been extensively studied in isolation, merging their benefits with a single framework has been rarely studied. In this paper, we propose UGPNet, a universal image restoration framework that can effectively achieve the benefits of both approaches by simply adopting a pair of an existing regression model and a generative model. UGPNet first restores the image structure of a degraded input using a regression model and synthesizes a perceptually-realistic image with a generative model on top of the regressed output. UGPNet then combines the regressed output and the synthesized output, resulting in a final result that faithfully reconstructs the structure of the original image in addition to perceptually-realistic textures. Our extensive experiments on deblurring, denoising, and super-resolution demonstrate that UGPNet can successfully exploit both regression and generative methods for high-fidelity image restoration.", "authors": "Hwayoon Lee, Kyoungkook Kang, Hyeongmin Lee, Seung-Hwan Baek, Sunghyun Cho", "date": "31 Dec 2023"},

However, the traditional FL relies on a central server to orchestrate the global model training among clients. This makes it vulnerable to the failure of the model server. Meanwhile, the model trained based on the global data property may not yield the best performance on the local data of a particular site due to the variations of data characteristics among them. To address these limitations, we proposed Gossip Mutual Learning(GML), a decentralized collaborative learning framework that employs Gossip Protocol for direct peer-to-peer communication and encourages each site to optimize its local model by leveraging useful information from peers through mutual learning. On the task of tumor segmentation on PET/CT images using HECKTOR21 dataset with 223 cases from five clinical sites, we demonstrated GML could improve tumor segmentation performance in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by 3.2%, 4.6% and 10.4% on site-specific testing cases as compared to three baseline methods: pooled training, FedAvg and individual training, respectively. We also showed GML has comparable generalization performance as pooled training and FedAvg when applying them on 78 cases from two out-of-sample sites where no case was used for model training.

When such simulations incorporate digital twins; computational models of patient-specific anatomy, they can expedite and de-risk the device design process. Nonetheless, the exclusive use of patient-specific data constrains the anatomic variability which can be precisely or fully explored. In this study, we investigate the capacity of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to edit digital twins to create anatomic variants, which we term digital siblings. Digital twins and their corresponding siblings can serve as the basis for comparative simulations, enabling the study of how subtle anatomic variations impact the simulated deployment of cardiovascular devices, as well as the augmentation of virtual cohorts for device assessment. However, while diffusion models have been characterized in their ability to edit natural images, their capacity to anatomically edit digital twins has yet to be studied. Using a case example centered on 3D digital twins of cardiac anatomy, we implement various methods for generating digital siblings and characterize them through morphological and topological analyses. We specifically edit digital twins to introduce anatomic variation at different spatial scales and within localized regions, demonstrating the existence of bias towards common anatomic features.

Specifically, our proposed approach integrates the utterance-level emotion embedding extracted by SER with fine-grained frame-level emotion embedding obtained from SED.

{"title": "Similar but Faster: Manipulation of Tempo in Music Audio Embeddings for Tempo Prediction and Search", "abstract": "Audio embeddings enable large scale comparisons of the similarity of audio files for applications such as search and recommendation. Due to the subjectivity of audio similarity, it can be desirable to design systems that answer not only whether audio is similar, but similar in what way (e.g., wrt. tempo, mood or genre). Previous works have proposed disentangled embedding spaces where subspaces representing specific, yet possibly correlated, attributes can be weighted to emphasize those attributes in downstream tasks. However, no research has been conducted into the independence of these subspaces, nor their manipulation, in order to retrieve tracks that are similar but different in a specific way. Here, we explore the manipulation of tempo in embedding spaces as a case-study towards this goal. We propose tempo translation functions that allow for efficient manipulation of tempo within a pre-existing embedding space whilst maintaining other properties such as genre. As this translation is specific to tempo it enables retrieval of tracks that are similar but have specifically different tempi. We show that such a function can be used as an efficient data augmentation strategy for both training of downstream tempo predictors, and improved nearest neighbor retrieval of properties largely independent of tempo.", "authors": "Matthew C.

In the ISI minimization based waveform design strategy, the optimization problem is convex and can be easily solved. In the achievable rate maximization based waveform design strategy, we propose a water-filling (WF) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based algorithm to derive the covariance matrix and the precoding matrix.

Given that annotating tempo is time-consuming and requires certain musical expertise, few publicly available data sources exist to train machine learning models for this task. Towards alleviating this issue, we propose a fully self-supervised approach that does not rely on any human labeled data. Our method builds on the fact that generic (music) audio embeddings already encode a variety of properties, including information about tempo, making them easily adaptable for downstream tasks. While recent work in self-supervised tempo estimation aimed to learn a tempo specific representation that was subsequently used to train a supervised classifier, we reformulate the task into the binary classification problem of predicting whether a target track has the same or a different tempo compared to a reference. While the former still requires labeled training data for the final classification model, our approach uses arbitrary unlabeled music data in combination with time-stretching for model training as well as a small set of synthetically created reference samples for predicting the final tempo.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration of boosting LLMs with the ability to generate speech, by combining pre-trained LLM LLaMA/OPT and text-to-speech synthesis model VALL-E. We compare three integration methods between LLMs and speech synthesis models, including directly fine-tuned LLMs, superposed layers of LLMs and VALL-E, and coupled LLMs and VALL-E using LLMs as a powerful text encoder. Experimental results show that, using LoRA method to fine-tune LLMs directly to boost the speech synthesis capability does not work well, and superposed LLMs and VALL-E can improve the quality of generated speech both in speaker similarity and word error rate (WER).

Hence, it requires a periodical inspection to ensure proper functionality and avoid catastrophic failure. The task of inspection is challenging due to the remote location and inconvenient reachability by human inspection. Researchers used images with cropped defects from the wind turbine in the literature. They neglected possible background biases, which may hinder real-time and autonomous defect detection using aerial vehicles such as drones or others. To overcome such challenges, in this paper, we experiment with defect detection accuracy by having the defects with the background using a two-step deep-learning methodology. In the first step, we develop virtual models of wind turbines to synthesize the near-reality images for four types of common defects - cracks, leading edge erosion, bending, and light striking damage. The Unity perception package is used to generate wind turbine blade defects images with variations in background, randomness, camera angle, and light effects. In the second step, a customized U-Net architecture is trained to classify and segment the defect in turbine blades. The outcomes of U-Net architecture have been thoroughly tested and compared with 5-fold validation datasets.

This research investigated the capabilities of Jukebox, an open-source commercially available neural network, to accurately replicate two genres of music often found in rhythm games, artcore and orchestral. A Google Colab notebook provided the computational resources necessary to sample and extend a total of sixteen piano arrangements of both genres. A survey containing selected samples was distributed to a local youth orchestra to gauge people's perceptions of the musicality of AI and human-generated music. Even though humans preferred human-generated music, Jukebox's slightly high rating showed that it was somewhat capable at mimicking the styles of both genres.

{"title": "Hold 'em and Fold 'em: Towards Human-scale, Feedback-Controlled Soft Origami Robots", "abstract": "An underdeveloped capability in soft robotics is proprioceptive feedback control, where soft actuators can be sensed and controlled using only sensors on the robot's body. Additionally, soft actuators are often unable to support human-scale loads due to the extremely compliant materials in use. Developing both feedback control and the ability to actuate under large loads (e.g. 500 N) are key capacities required to move soft robotics into everyday applications. In this work, we independently demonstrate these key factors towards controlling and actuating human-scale loads: proprioceptive (embodied) feedback control of a soft, pneumatically-actuated origami robot; and actuation of these origami origami robots under a person's weight in an open-loop configuration. In both demonstrations, the actuators are controlled by internal fluidic pressure. Capacitive sensors patterned onto the robot provide position estimation and serve as input to a feedback controller. We demonstrate position control of a single actuator during stepped setpoints and sinusoidal trajectory following, with root mean square error (RMSE) below 4 mm. We also showcase the actuator's potential towards human-scale robotics as an \"origami balance board\" by joining three actuators into an open-loop controlled system with a platform that varies its height, roll, and pitch.

{"title": "On the Effect of Data-Augmentation on Local Embedding Properties in the Contrastive Learning of Music Audio Representations", "abstract": "Audio embeddings are crucial tools in understanding large catalogs of music. Typically embeddings are evaluated on the basis of the performance they provide in a wide range of downstream tasks, however few studies have investigated the local properties of the embedding spaces themselves which are important in nearest neighbor algorithms, commonly used in music search and recommendation. In this work we show that when learning audio representations on music datasets via contrastive learning, musical properties that are typically homogeneous within a track (e.g., key and tempo) are reflected in the locality of neighborhoods in the resulting embedding space. By applying appropriate data augmentation strategies, localisation of such properties can not only be reduced but the localisation of other attributes is increased. For example, locality of features such as pitch and tempo that are less relevant to non-expert listeners, may be mitigated while improving the locality of more salient features such as genre and mood, achieving state-of-the-art performance in nearest neighbor retrieval accuracy. Similarly, we show that the optimal selection of data augmentation strategies for contrastive learning of music audio embeddings is dependent on the downstream task, highlighting this as an important embedding design decision.", "authors": "Matthew C.

Prevailing methods, however, encounter limitations at adapting to new speakers of out-of-domain settings, primarily due to inadequate speaker disentanglement and content leakage. To overcome these constraints, we propose an innovative negation feature learning paradigm that models decoupled speaker attributes as deviations from the complete audio representation by utilizing the subtraction operation. By eliminating superfluous content information from the speaker representation, our negation scheme not only mitigates content leakage, thereby enhancing synthesis robustness, but also improves speaker fidelity. In addition, to facilitate the learning of diverse speaker attributes, we leverage multi-stream Transformers, which retain multiple hypotheses and instigate a training paradigm akin to ensemble learning. To unify these hypotheses and realize the final speaker representation, we employ attention pooling. Finally, in light of the imperative to generate target text utterances in the desired voice, we adopt adaptive layer normalizations to effectively fuse the previously generated speaker representation with the target text representations, as opposed to mere concatenation of the text and audio modalities. Extensive experiments and validations substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach in preserving and harnessing speaker-specific attributes vis-`a-vis alternative baseline models.", "authors": "Yejin Jeon, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},

Automatic sea ice detection using SAR imagery remains problematic due to the presence of ambiguous signal and noise within the image. Conversely, ice and water are easily distinguishable using multispectral imagery (MSI), but in the polar regions the ocean's surface is often occluded by cloud or the sun may not appear above the horizon for many months. To address some of these limitations, this paper proposes a new tool trained using concurrent multispectral Visible and SAR imagery for sea Ice Detection (ViSual\\_IceD). ViSual\\_IceD is a convolution neural network (CNN) that builds on the classic U-Net architecture by containing two parallel encoder stages, enabling the fusion and concatenation of MSI and SAR imagery containing different spatial resolutions.

Here we explore how prediction may lie at the core of brain function by considering a neuron predicting the future of a scalar time series input. Assuming that the dynamics of the lag vector (a vector composed of several consecutive elements of the time series) are locally linear, Normal Mode Decomposition decomposes the dynamics into independently evolving (eigen-)modes allowing for straightforward prediction. We propose that a neuron learns the top mode and projects its input onto the associated subspace. Under this interpretation, the temporal filter of a neuron corresponds to the left eigenvector of a generalized eigenvalue problem. We mathematically analyze the operation of such an algorithm on noisy observations of synthetic data generated by a linear system. Interestingly, the shape of the temporal filter varies with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): a noisy input yields a monophasic filter and a growing SNR leads to multiphasic filters with progressively greater number of phases. Such variation in the temporal filter with input SNR resembles that observed experimentally in biological neurons.", "authors": "Siavash Golkar, Jules Berman, David Lipshutz, Robert Mihai Haret, Tim Gollisch, Dmitri B.

{"title": "Shrinking Your TimeStep: Towards Low-Latency Neuromorphic Object Recognition with Spiking Neural Network", "abstract": "Neuromorphic object recognition with spiking neural networks (SNNs) is the cornerstone of low-power neuromorphic computing. However, existing SNNs suffer from significant latency, utilizing 10 to 40 timesteps or more, to recognize neuromorphic objects. At low latencies, the performance of existing SNNs is drastically degraded. In this work, we propose the Shrinking SNN (SSNN) to achieve low-latency neuromorphic object recognition without reducing performance. Concretely, we alleviate the temporal redundancy in SNNs by dividing SNNs into multiple stages with progressively shrinking timesteps, which significantly reduces the inference latency. During timestep shrinkage, the temporal transformer smoothly transforms the temporal scale and preserves the information maximally. Moreover, we add multiple early classifiers to the SNN during training to mitigate the mismatch between the surrogate gradient and the true gradient, as well as the gradient vanishing/exploding, thus eliminating the performance degradation at low latency.

{"title": "The Effect of Intrinsic Dataset Properties on Generalization: Unraveling Learning Differences Between Natural and Medical Images", "abstract": "This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension ($d_{data}$) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to $d_{data}$, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic \"label sharpness\" ($K_F$) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model's adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our $d_{data}$ formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension ($d_{repr}$), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to $d_{repr}$, and show that $d_{data}$ serves as an upper bound for $d_{repr}$. Our theoretical results are supported by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging datasets over a range of training set sizes. Our findings offer insights into the influence of intrinsic dataset properties on generalization, representation learning, and robustness in deep neural networks.", "authors": "Nicholas Konz, Maciej A.

{"title": "Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction for Freehand 3D Ultrasound Volumetric Point Clouds with Geometric Constraints", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) freehand ultrasound (US) is a widely used imaging modality that allows non-invasive imaging of medical anatomy without radiation exposure. The freehand 3D US surface reconstruction is vital to acquire the accurate anatomical structures needed for modeling, registration, and visualization. However, the currently used traditional methods cannot produce a high-quality surface due to imaging noise and connectivity issues in US. Although the deep learning-based approaches exhibiting the improvements in smoothness, continuity and resolution, the investigation into freehand 3D US remains limited. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction method to learn the signed distance functions (SDFs) from freehand 3D US volumetric point clouds. In particular, our method iteratively learns the SDFs by moving the 3D queries sampled around the point clouds to approximate the surface with the assistance of two novel geometric constraints. We assess our method on the three imaging systems, using twenty-three shapes that include six distinct anthropomorphic phantoms datasets and seventeen in vivo carotid artery datasets. Experimental results on phantoms outperform the existing approach, with a 67% reduction in Chamfer distance, 60% in Hausdorff distance, and 61% in Average absolute distance. Furthermore, our method achieves a 0.92 Dice score on the in vivo datasets and demonstrates great clinical potential.", "authors": "Hongbo Chen, Logiraj Kumaralingam, Edmond H. M.

Firstly, based on the theorems of cyclotomic polynomials, we derive a sufficient condition for uniquely identifying the original signal in modulo-DFT. Additionally, for periodic bandlimited signals (PBSs) under unlimited sampling which can be viewed as a special case of modulo-DFT, the necessary and sufficient condition for the unique recovery of the original signal are provided. Moreover, we show that when the oversampling factor exceeds $3(1+1/P)$, PBS is always identifiable from the modulo samples, where $P$ is the number of harmonics including the fundamental component in the positive frequency part.", "authors": "Qi Zhang, Jiang Zhu, Fengzhong Qu, Zheng Zhu, De Wen Soh", "date": "30 Dec 2023"},

The viability of implementing SL in such scenarios is caused by its inherent model partitioning, with clients executing the smaller model segment.

{"title": "AI and Tempo Estimation: A Review", "abstract": "The author's goal in this paper is to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilised to inform our understanding of and ability to estimate at scale a critical aspect of musical creativity - musical tempo. The central importance of tempo to musical creativity can be seen in how it is used to express specific emotions (Eerola and Vuoskoski 2013), suggest particular musical styles (Li and Chan 2011), influence perception of expression (Webster and Weir 2005) and mediate the urge to move one's body in time to the music (Burger et al. 2014). Traditional tempo estimation methods typically detect signal periodicities that reflect the underlying rhythmic structure of the music, often using some form of autocorrelation of the amplitude envelope (Lartillot and Toiviainen 2007). Recently, AI-based methods utilising convolutional or recurrent neural networks (CNNs, RNNs) on spectral representations of the audio signal have enjoyed significant improvements in accuracy (Aarabi and Peeters 2022). Common AI-based techniques include those based on probability (e.g., Bayesian approaches, hidden Markov models (HMM)), classification and statistical learning (e.g., support vector machines (SVM)), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (e.g., self-organising maps (SOMs), CNNs, RNNs, deep learning (DL)). The aim here is to provide an overview of some of the more common AI-based tempo estimation algorithms and to shine a light on notable benefits and potential drawbacks of each. Limitations of AI in this field in general are also considered, as is the capacity for such methods to account for idiosyncrasies inherent in tempo perception, i.e., how well AI-based approaches are able to think and act like humans.", "authors": "Geoff Luck", "date": "30 Dec 2023"},

We investigate machine learning methodology that applies multi-view approaches to improve the prediction of non-imaging phenotypes, including demographics (age), motor (strength), and cognition (picture vocabulary). We present an explainable multi-view network (EMV-Net) that can use different anatomical views to improve prediction performance. In this network, each individual anatomical view is processed by a view-specific feature extractor and the extracted information from each view is fused using a learnable weight. This is followed by a wavelet transform-based module to obtain complementary information across views which is then applied to calibrate the view-specific information.

{"title": "Reputation-Based Federated Learning Defense to Mitigate Threats in EEG Signal Classification", "abstract": "This paper presents a reputation-based threat mitigation framework that defends potential security threats in electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification during model aggregation of Federated Learning. While EEG signal analysis has attracted attention because of the emergence of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, it is difficult to create efficient learning models for EEG analysis because of the distributed nature of EEG data and related privacy and security concerns. To address these challenges, the proposed defending framework leverages the Federated Learning paradigm to preserve privacy by collaborative model training with localized data from dispersed sources and introduces a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the influence of data poisoning attacks and identify compromised participants. To assess the efficiency of the proposed reputation-based federated learning defense framework, data poisoning attacks based on the risk level of training data derived by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are conducted on both publicly available EEG signal datasets and the self-established EEG signal dataset. Experimental results on the poisoned datasets show that the proposed defense methodology performs well in EEG signal classification while reducing the risks associated with security threats.", "authors": "Zhibo Zhang, Pengfei Li, Ahmed Y.

{"title": "Attention-Based CNN-BiLSTM for Sleep State Classification of Spatiotemporal Wide-Field Calcium Imaging Data", "abstract": "Background: Wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) with genetically encoded calcium indicators allows for spatiotemporal recordings of neuronal activity in mice. When applied to the study of sleep, WFCI data are manually scored into the sleep states of wakefulness, non-REM (NREM) and REM by use of adjunct EEG and EMG recordings. However, this process is time-consuming, invasive and often suffers from low inter- and intra-rater reliability. Therefore, an automated sleep state classification method that operates on spatiotemporal WFCI data is desired. New Method: A hybrid network architecture consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features of image frames and a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) with attention mechanism to identify temporal dependencies among different time points was proposed to classify WFCI data into states of wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep. Results: Sleep states were classified with an accuracy of 84% and Cohen's kappa of 0.64. Gradient-weighted class activation maps revealed that the frontal region of the cortex carries more importance when classifying WFCI data into NREM sleep while posterior area contributes most to the identification of wakefulness. The attention scores indicated that the proposed network focuses on short- and long-range temporal dependency in a state-specific manner. Comparison with Existing Method: On a 3-hour WFCI recording, the CNN-BiLSTM achieved a kappa of 0.67, comparable to a kappa of 0.65 corresponding to the human EEG/EMG-based scoring. Conclusions: The CNN-BiLSTM effectively classifies sleep states from spatiotemporal WFCI data and will enable broader application of WFCI in sleep.", "authors": "Xiaohui Zhang, Eric C.

Unlike prior work, MAGNeT is comprised of a single-stage, non-autoregressive transformer. During training, we predict spans of masked tokens obtained from a masking scheduler, while during inference we gradually construct the output sequence using several decoding steps. To further enhance the quality of the generated audio, we introduce a novel rescoring method in which, we leverage an external pre-trained model to rescore and rank predictions from MAGNeT, which will be then used for later decoding steps. Lastly, we explore a hybrid version of MAGNeT, in which we fuse between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models to generate the first few seconds in an autoregressive manner while the rest of the sequence is being decoded in parallel. We demonstrate the efficiency of MAGNeT for the task of text-to-music and text-to-audio generation and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering both objective metrics and human studies. The proposed approach is comparable to the evaluated baselines, while being significantly faster (x7 faster than the autoregressive baseline).

{"title": "Improving ASR Contextual Biasing with Guided Attention", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Guided Attention (GA) auxiliary training loss, which improves the effectiveness and robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) contextual biasing without introducing additional parameters. A common challenge in previous literature is that the word error rate (WER) reduction brought by contextual biasing diminishes as the number of bias phrases increases. To address this challenge, we employ a GA loss as an additional training objective besides the Transducer loss. The proposed GA loss aims to teach the cross attention how to align bias phrases with text tokens or audio frames. Compared to studies with similar motivations, the proposed loss operates directly on the cross attention weights and is easier to implement. Through extensive experiments based on Conformer Transducer with Contextual Adapter, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only leads to a lower WER but also retains its effectiveness as the number of bias phrases increases. Specifically, the GA loss decreases the WER of rare vocabularies by up to 19.2% on LibriSpeech compared to the contextual biasing baseline, and up to 49.3% compared to a vanilla Transducer.", "authors": "Jiyang Tang, Kwangyoun Kim, Suwon Shon, Felix Wu, Prashant Sridhar, Shinji Watanabe", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

However, previous TS-VAD models take audio features and utilize the speaker's acoustic footprint to distinguish his or her personal speech activities, which is susceptible to overlapped speaking in multi-speaker scenarios.

It greatly facilitates downstream applications such as pan-sharpening, change detection, land-cover classification, etc. Yet, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and thus are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications, such as pan-sharpening, and spatial-temporal image fusion. Considering that image fusion can be theoretically applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations, in this paper, we expanded its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works with a simple taxonomy: 1) many-to-one image fusion; 2) many-to-many image fusion. This simple taxonomy defines image fusion as a mapping problem that turns either a single or a set of images into another single or set of images, depending on the desired coherence, e.g., spectral, spatial/resolution coherence, etc. We show that this simple taxonomy, despite the significant modality difference it covers, can be presented by a conceptually easy framework. In addition, we provide a meta-analysis to review the major papers studying the various types of image fusion and their applications over the years (from the 1980s to date), covering 5,926 peer-reviewed papers.

Specifically, we employ different projectors to learn the frame-wise features for each category. To ensure that these feature does not contain information of other categories, we maximize the common information between frame-wise features within the same category and propose a frame-wise contrastive loss.

Self-supervised pretraining, which doesn't rely on labeled data, can enhance robustness against noisy labels.

In medical images, subtle inter-class differences and modality-specific characteristics add complexity. Previous research hasn't comprehensively explored the interplay between self-supervised learning and robustness against noisy labels in medical image classification, considering all these factors. In this study, we address three key questions: i) How does label noise impact various medical image classification datasets? ii) Which types of medical image datasets are more challenging to learn and more affected by label noise? iii) How do different self-supervised pretraining methods enhance robustness across various medical image datasets? Our results show that DermNet, among five datasets (Fetal plane, DermNet, COVID-DU-Ex, MURA, NCT-CRC-HE-100K), is the most challenging but exhibits greater robustness against noisy labels.

To overcome the need for symbol-level IE precoding to frequently update the precoding matrix, we propose to jointly optimize all the precoders or transmit signals within a transmission block. The resultant precoders only need to be updated once per block, and while not necessarily constant over all the symbol slots, we refer to the technique as block-level slot-variant IE precoding. Through a careful examination of the optimal structure and the explicit duality inherent in block-level power minimization (PM) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing (SB) problems, we discover that the joint optimization can be decomposed into subproblems with smaller variable sizes. As a step further, we propose block-level slot-invariant IE precoding by adding a structural constraint on the slot-variant IE precoding to maintain a constant precoder throughout the block. A novel linear precoder for IE is further presented, and we prove that the proposed slot-variant and slot-invariant IE precoding share an identical solution when the number of symbol slots does not exceed the number of users.

Specifically, we learn a positive semi-definite (PSD) metric matrix $\\mathbf{M} \\succeq 0$ that defines Mahalanobis distances between graph nodes (visual events) endowed with pre-computed feature vectors; the computed inter-node distances lead to edge weights and a combinatorial graph that is amenable to binary classification. Mathematically, we define the objective of metric matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ optimization using a graph adaptation of large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), which is rewritten as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. We solve it efficiently via a fast approximation called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA) linearization.

{"title": "Self-navigated 3D diffusion MRI using an optimized CAIPI sampling and structured low-rank reconstruction", "abstract": "3D multi-slab acquisitions are an appealing approach for diffusion MRI because they are compatible with the imaging regime delivering optimal SNR efficiency. In conventional 3D multi-slab imaging, shot-to-shot phase variations caused by motion pose challenges due to the use of multi-shot k-space acquisition. Navigator acquisition after each imaging echo is typically employed to correct phase variations, which prolongs scan time and increases the specific absorption rate (SAR). The aim of this study is to develop a highly efficient, self-navigated method to correct for phase variations in 3D multi-slab diffusion MRI without explicitly acquiring navigators. The sampling of each shot is carefully designed to intersect with the central kz plane of each slab, and the multi-shot sampling is optimized for self-navigation performance while retaining decent reconstruction quality. The central kz intersections from all shots are jointly used to reconstruct a 2D phase map for each shot using a structured low-rank constrained reconstruction that leverages the redundancy in shot and coil dimensions. The phase maps are used to eliminate the shot-to-shot phase inconsistency in the final 3D multi-shot reconstruction. We demonstrate the method's efficacy using retrospective simulations and prospectively acquired in-vivo experiments at 1.22 mm and 1.09 mm isotropic resolutions. Compared to conventional navigated 3D multi-slab imaging, the proposed self-navigated method achieves comparable image quality while shortening the scan time by 31.7% and improving the SNR efficiency by 15.5%.

The Itakura-Saito divergence is then employed to estimate the source model related parameters. In reality, however, the spectral coefficients from different frequency bands may be dependent, which is not considered in the existing ILRMA algorithm. This paper presents an improved version of ILRMA, which considers the dependency between the spectral coefficients from different frequency bands. The Sinkhorn divergence is then exploited to optimize the source model parameters. As a result of using the cross-band information, the BSS performance is improved. But the number of parameters to be estimated also increases significantly, and so is the computational complexity. To reduce the algorithm complexity, we apply the Kronecker product to decompose the modeling matrix into the product of a number of matrices of much smaller dimensionality. An efficient algorithm is then developed to implement the Sinkhorn divergence based BSS algorithm and the complexity is reduced by an order of magnitude.", "authors": "Jianyu Wang, Shanzheng Guan, Jingdong Chen, Jacob Benesty", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Transferable Learned Image Compression-Resistant Adversarial Perturbations", "abstract": "Adversarial attacks can readily disrupt the image classification system, revealing the vulnerability of DNN-based recognition tasks. While existing adversarial perturbations are primarily applied to uncompressed images or compressed images by the traditional image compression method, i.e., JPEG, limited studies have investigated the robustness of models for image classification in the context of DNN-based image compression. With the rapid evolution of advanced image compression, DNN-based learned image compression has emerged as the promising approach for transmitting images in many security-critical applications, such as cloud-based face recognition and autonomous driving, due to its superior performance over traditional compression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to fully investigate the robustness of a classification system post-processed by learned image compression. To bridge this research gap, we explore the adversarial attack on a new pipeline that targets image classification models that utilize learned image compressors as pre-processing modules. Furthermore, to enhance the transferability of perturbations across various quality levels and architectures of learned image compression models, we introduce a saliency score-based sampling method to enable the fast generation of transferable perturbation. Extensive experiments with popular attack methods demonstrate the enhanced transferability of our proposed method when attacking images that have been post-processed with different learned image compression models.", "authors": "Yang Sui, Zhuohang Li, Ding Ding, Xiang Pan, Xiaozhong Xu, Shan Liu, Zhenzhong Chen", "date": "6 Jan 2024"},

This trend, together with the single imbalance pricing, opens an opportunity for balance responsible parties (BRPs) to perform energy arbitrage in the imbalance settlement mechanism. To this end, we propose a battery control framework based on distributional reinforcement learning (DRL). Our proposed control framework takes a risk-sensitive perspective, allowing BRPs to adjust their risk preferences: we aim to optimize a weighted sum of the arbitrage profit and a risk measure while constraining the daily number of cycles for the battery. We assess the performance of our proposed control framework using the Belgian imbalance prices of 2022 and compare two state-of-the-art RL methods, deep Q learning and soft actor-critic. Results reveal that the distributional soft actor-critic method can outperform other methods. Moreover, we note that our fully risk-averse agent appropriately learns to hedge against the risk related to the unknown imbalance price by (dis)charging the battery only when the agent is more certain about the price.", "authors": "Seyed Soroush Karimi Madahi, Bert Claessens, Chris Develder", "date": "23 Dec 2023"},
{"title": "SonicVisionLM: Playing Sound with Vision Language Models", "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production. However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations. In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models. Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs). When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content. This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models. To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.

{"title": "Optimal Transcoding Resolution Prediction for Efficient Per-Title Bitrate Ladder Estimation", "abstract": "Adaptive video streaming requires efficient bitrate ladder construction to meet heterogeneous network conditions and end-user demands. Per-title optimized encoding typically traverses numerous encoding parameters to search the Pareto-optimal operating points for each video. Recently, researchers have attempted to predict the content-optimized bitrate ladder for pre-encoding overhead reduction. However, existing methods commonly estimate the encoding parameters on the Pareto front and still require subsequent pre-encodings. In this paper, we propose to directly predict the optimal transcoding resolution at each preset bitrate for efficient bitrate ladder construction. We adopt a Temporal Attentive Gated Recurrent Network to capture spatial-temporal features and predict transcoding resolutions as a multi-task classification problem. We demonstrate that content-optimized bitrate ladders can thus be efficiently determined without any pre-encoding.

{"title": "Adaptive Boosting with Fairness-aware Reweighting Technique for Fair Classification", "abstract": "Machine learning methods based on AdaBoost have been widely applied to various classification problems across many mission-critical applications including healthcare, law and finance. However, there is a growing concern about the unfairness and discrimination of data-driven classification models, which is inevitable for classical algorithms including AdaBoost. In order to achieve fair classification, a novel fair AdaBoost (FAB) approach is proposed that is an interpretable fairness-improving variant of AdaBoost. We mainly investigate binary classification problems and focus on the fairness of three different indicators (i.e., accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate). By utilizing a fairness-aware reweighting technique for base classifiers, the proposed FAB approach can achieve fair classification while maintaining the advantage of AdaBoost with negligible sacrifice of predictive performance. In addition, a hyperparameter is introduced in FAB to show preferences for the fairness-accuracy trade-off. An upper bound for the target loss function that quantifies error rate and unfairness is theoretically derived for FAB, which provides a strict theoretical support for the fairness-improving methods designed for AdaBoost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on three real-world datasets (i.e., Adult, COMPAS and HSLS) with respect to the three fairness indicators. The results are accordant with theoretic analyses, and show that (i) FAB significantly improves classification fairness at a small cost of accuracy compared with AdaBoost; and (ii) FAB outperforms state-of-the-art fair classification methods including equalized odds method, exponentiated gradient method, and disparate mistreatment method in terms of the fairness-accuracy trade-off.", "authors": "Xiaobin Song, Zeyuan Liu, Benben Jiang", "date": "6 Jan 2024"},

Although several methods to suppress the exterior radiation have been proposed, suppression in all outward directions is generally difficult, especially when the number of loudspeakers is not sufficiently large. We propose the directionally weighted exterior radiation representation to prioritize the suppression directions by incorporating it into the optimization problem of sound field synthesis. By using the proposed representation, the exterior radiation in the prioritized directions can be significantly reduced while maintaining high interior synthesis accuracy, owing to the relaxed constraint on the exterior radiation.

To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we first analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel tensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target sensing problems. Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional communication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we associate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets in terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions. Then, we propose a shared training pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the channel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a canonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical expression. On this basis, we first investigate the uniqueness condition of the tensor factorization and the maximum number of resolvable targets by utilizing the specific Vandermonde", "authors": "Ruoyu Zhang, Lei Cheng, Shuai Wang, Yi Lou, Yulong Gao, Wen Wu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

For this, we propose a methodology based on Siamese neural networks in which a series of techniques are integrated to mitigate the effects of data scarcity and distribution imbalance. Specifically, different initialization and data augmentation methods are analyzed, and four adaptations to Siamese networks of solutions to deal with imbalanced data are introduced, including data balancing and weighted loss, both separately and combined, and with a different balance of pairing ratios. Moreover, we also assess the inference process considering four classifiers, namely Histogram, $k$NN, SVM, and Random Forest. Evaluation is performed on three chest X-ray datasets with annotated cases of both positive and negative COVID-19 diagnoses. The accuracy of each technique proposed for the Siamese architecture is analyzed separately and their results are compared to those obtained using equivalent methods on a state-of-the-art CNN.

{"title": "Reliability-Optimized User Admission Control for URLLC Traffic: A Neural Contextual Bandit Approach", "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is the cornerstone for a broad range of emerging services in next-generation wireless networks. URLLC fundamentally relies on the network's ability to proactively determine whether sufficient resources are available to support the URLLC traffic, and thus, prevent so-called cell overloads. Nonetheless, achieving accurate quality-of-service (QoS) predictions for URLLC user equipment (UEs) and preventing cell overloads are very challenging tasks. This is due to dependency of the QoS metrics (latency and reliability) on traffic and channel statistics, users' mobility, and interdependent performance across UEs. In this paper, a new QoS-aware UE admission control approach is developed to proactively estimate QoS for URLLC UEs, prior to associating them with a cell, and accordingly, admit only a subset of UEs that do not lead to a cell overload. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to find an efficient UE admission control policy, cognizant of UEs' QoS requirements and cell-level load dynamics. To solve this problem, a new machine learning based method is proposed that builds on (deep) neural contextual bandits, a suitable framework for dealing with nonlinear bandit problems. In fact, the UE admission controller is treated as a bandit agent that observes a set of network measurements (context) and makes admission control decisions based on context-dependent QoS (reward) predictions.

During offline model development, the multivariate sensor data are decomposed to learn fused temporal correlation features that are generalisable and representative of normal operation dynamics across multiple operating conditions. Monitoring statistics and control limit thresholds for normal behaviour are dynamically constructed from these learnt temporal features for the unsupervised detection of device-level change points. The detected change points then inform the degradation data labelling for training a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based RUL estimation model. During online monitoring, the temporal correlation dynamics of a query device is monitored for breach of the control limit derived in offline training.

Following prior arts in self-supervised audio-visual representation learning, HiCMAE adopts two primary forms of self-supervision for pre-training, namely masked data modeling and contrastive learning. Unlike them which focus exclusively on top-layer representations while neglecting explicit guidance of intermediate layers, HiCMAE develops a three-pronged strategy to foster hierarchical audio-visual feature learning and improve the overall quality of learned representations. To verify the effectiveness of HiCMAE, we conduct extensive experiments on 9 datasets covering both categorical and dimensional AVER tasks. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual methods, which indicates that HiCMAE is a powerful audio-visual emotion representation learner.

{"title": "An AI-enabled Bias-Free Respiratory Disease Diagnosis Model using Cough Audio: A Case Study for COVID-19", "abstract": "Cough-based diagnosis for Respiratory Diseases (RDs) using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attracted considerable attention, yet many existing studies overlook confounding variables in their predictive models. These variables can distort the relationship between cough recordings (input data) and RD status (output variable), leading to biased associations and unrealistic model performance. To address this gap, we propose the Bias Free Network (RBFNet), an end to end solution that effectively mitigates the impact of confounders in the training data distribution. RBFNet ensures accurate and unbiased RD diagnosis features, emphasizing its relevance by incorporating a COVID19 dataset in this study. This approach aims to enhance the reliability of AI based RD diagnosis models by navigating the challenges posed by confounding variables. A hybrid of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks is proposed for the feature encoder module of RBFNet. An additional bias predictor is incorporated in the classification scheme to formulate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) which helps in decorrelating the impact of confounding variables from RD prediction. The merit of RBFNet is demonstrated by comparing classification performance with State of The Art (SoTA) Deep Learning (DL) model (CNN LSTM) after training on different unbalanced COVID-19 data sets, created by using a large scale proprietary cough data set. RBF-Net proved its robustness against extremely biased training scenarios by achieving test set accuracies of 84.1%, 84.6%, and 80.5% for the following confounding variables gender, age, and smoking status, respectively.

A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or man-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas. In such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save the national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the PSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services in the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible, mobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted PSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area's ground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV. The objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the video streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by optimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the distribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power, while satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate, rate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To this end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is mathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge for a solution. Considering the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed.

Unlike most methods that rely on ground truth data in the form of subtitles, in this work we exploit modalities that come naturally with videos: (a) video frames as they contain visual information indispensable for scene understanding, (b) audio as it contains higher-level cues associated with funny moments, such as intonation, pitch and pauses and (c) text automatically extracted with a speech-to-text model as it can provide rich information when processed by a Large Language Model. To acquire labels for training, we propose an unsupervised approach that spots and labels funny audio moments. We provide experiments on five datasets: the sitcoms TBBT, MHD, MUStARD, Friends, and the TED talk UR-Funny. Extensive experiments and analysis show that FunnyNet-W successfully exploits visual, auditory and textual cues to identify funny moments, while our findings reveal FunnyNet-W's ability to predict funny moments in the wild.

{"title": "Efficient Selective Audio Masked Multimodal Bottleneck Transformer for Audio-Video Classification", "abstract": "Audio and video are two most common modalities in the mainstream media platforms, e.g., YouTube. To learn from multimodal videos effectively, in this work, we propose a novel audio-video recognition approach termed audio video Transformer, AVT, leveraging the effective spatio-temporal representation by the video Transformer to improve action recognition accuracy. For multimodal fusion, simply concatenating multimodal tokens in a cross-modal Transformer requires large computational and memory resources, instead we reduce the cross-modality complexity through an audio-video bottleneck Transformer. To improve the learning efficiency of multimodal Transformer, we integrate self-supervised objectives, i.e., audio-video contrastive learning, audio-video matching, and masked audio and video learning, into AVT training, which maps diverse audio and video representations into a common multimodal representation space. We further propose a masked audio segment loss to learn semantic audio activities in AVT. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three public datasets and two in-house datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AVT. Specifically, AVT outperforms its previous state-of-the-art counterparts on Kinetics-Sounds by 8%. AVT also surpasses one of the previous state-of-the-art video Transformers [25] by 10% on VGGSound by leveraging the audio signal.

The whole procedure is first to detect whether the character is erroneous, then to generate some candidate characters and finally to select the most confident one to replace the error character.

Then, we propose a greedy scheme to iteratively and alternately solve this problem, where a transformer-based beam predictor is trained to estimate the conditional power distribution based on the probing beams and user location within each iteration, and the trained predictor selects an unmeasured beam that minimizes the entropy of remaining beams. To further reduce the number of interactions and the computational complexity of the iterative scheme, we propose a two-stage probing beam selection scheme. Firstly, probing beams are selected from a location-specific codebook designed by an entropy-based criterion, and predictions are made with corresponding feedback. Secondly, the optimal beam is identified using additional probing beams with the highest predicted power values.

{"title": "A proposal for a minimal model of free reed", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a minimal model for free reeds  taking into account the significant phenomena. This free reed model may be used to build models of free reed instruments which permit numerical simulations. Several definitions for the section by which the airflow passes through the reed are reviewed and a new one is proposed which takes into account the entire escape area under the reed and the reed thickness. To derive this section, it is necessary to distinguish the neutral section (the only section of the reed which always keeps its length constant while moving) from the upstream or downstream sections. A minimal configuration is chosen to permit the instabilities of both (-,+) and (+,-) reeds on the basis of a linear analysis of instabilities conditions. This configuration is used to illustrate,  with temporal simulations, the minimal model for both kinds of reeds and to discuss the model assumptions. Some clues are given about the influence, on the playing frequency and on the dynamic of the sound, of two main parameters of the geometrical model: the size of the volume and the level of the excitation. It is shown that the playing frequency of a (+,-) reed can vary in a large range according to the  size of the volume upstream of the reed; that the playing frequency is nearly independent of the excitation but that the dynamic of the sound increases with the excitation level. Some clues are also proposed to determine the nature of the bifurcation for free reeds: it seems that free reeds may present inverse bifurcations. The influence of the reed thickness is also studied for configurations where the reed length or the reed width vary to keep the mass constant. This study shows that the reed thickness can have a great influence on the sound magnitude, the playing frequency and the magnitude of the reed displacement which justifies its introduction in the reed model.This article has been published in Acta Acustica united with Acustica, Vol. 93 (2007), p. 122-144.", "authors": "Laurent Millot", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

The similarity of hallucinations to probable natural language outputs of the model creates a danger of deception and impacts the credibility of the system. We show that commonly used metrics, such as word error rates, cannot differentiate between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models. To address this, we propose a perturbation-based method for assessing the susceptibility of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to hallucination at test time, which does not require access to the training dataset. We demonstrate that this method helps to distinguish between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models that have similar baseline word error rates. We further explore the relationship between the types of ASR errors and the types of dataset noise to determine what types of noise are most likely to create hallucinatory outputs.

{"title": "Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spatial-Temporal Traffic Flow Forecasting", "abstract": "Accurate spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting is crucial in aiding traffic managers in implementing control measures and assisting drivers in selecting optimal travel routes. Traditional deep-learning based methods for traffic flow forecasting typically rely on historical data to train their models, which are then used to make predictions on future data.

To make the model trained on historical data better adapt to future data in a fully online manner, this paper conducts the first study of the online test-time adaptation techniques for spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting problems. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Double Correction by Series Decomposition (ADCSD) method, which first decomposes the output of the trained model into seasonal and trend-cyclical parts and then corrects them by two separate modules during the testing phase using the latest observed data entry by entry. In the proposed ADCSD method, instead of fine-tuning the whole trained model during the testing phase, a lite network is attached after the trained model, and only the lite network is fine-tuned in the testing process each time a data entry is observed. Moreover, to satisfy that different time series variables may have different levels of temporal drift, two adaptive vectors are adopted to provide different weights for different time series variables.

A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then developed to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is uncorrelated with the basic features.

Different from existing metrics, AoII penalizes the incorrect information by increasing linearly with time as long as the source and the monitor are de-synchronized, and is reset when they are synchronized back. While AoII has generally been investigated for discrete time information sources, we develop a novel analytical model in this paper for push- and pull-based sampling and transmission of a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) process. In the pull-based model, the sensor starts transmitting information on the observed CTMC only when a pull request from the monitor is received. On the other hand, in the push-based scenario, the sensor, being aware of the AoII process, samples and transmits when the AoII process exceeds a random threshold. The proposed analytical model for both scenarios is based on the construction of a discrete time MC (DTMC) making state transitions at the embedded epochs of synchronization points, using the theory of absorbing CTMCs, and in particular phase-type distributions. For a given sampling policy, analytical models to obtain the mean AoII and the average sampling rate are developed.

{"title": "From Coarse to Fine: Efficient Training for Audio Spectrogram Transformers", "abstract": "Transformers have become central to recent advances in audio classification. However, training an audio spectrogram transformer, e.g. AST, from scratch can be resource and time-intensive. Furthermore, the complexity of transformers heavily depends on the input audio spectrogram size. In this work, we aim to optimize AST training by linking to the resolution in the time-axis. We introduce multi-phase training of audio spectrogram transformers by connecting the seminal idea of coarse-to-fine with transformer models. To achieve this, we propose a set of methods for temporal compression. By employing one of these methods, the transformer model learns from lower-resolution (coarse) data in the initial phases, and then is fine-tuned with high-resolution data later in a curriculum learning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed training mechanism for AST leads to improved (or on-par) performance with faster convergence, i.e. requiring fewer computational resources and less time. This approach is also generalizable to other AST-based methods regardless of their learning paradigms.", "authors": "Jiu Feng, Mehmet Hamza Erol, Joon Son Chung, Arda Senocak", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Self-Attention and Hybrid Features for Replay and Deep-Fake Audio Detection", "abstract": "Due to the successful application of deep learning, audio spoofing detection has made significant progress. Spoofed audio with speech synthesis or voice conversion can be well detected by many countermeasures. However, an automatic speaker verification system is still vulnerable to spoofing attacks such as replay or Deep-Fake audio. Deep-Fake audio means that the spoofed utterances are generated using text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) algorithms. Here, we propose a novel framework based on hybrid features with the self-attention mechanism. It is expected that hybrid features can be used to get more discrimination capacity. Firstly, instead of only one type of conventional feature, deep learning features and Mel-spectrogram features will be extracted by two parallel paths: convolution neural networks and a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) followed by Mel-frequency. Secondly, features will be concatenated by a max-pooling layer. Thirdly, there is a Self-attention mechanism for focusing on essential elements. Finally, ResNet and a linear layer are built to get the results. Experimental results reveal that the hybrid features, compared with conventional features, can cover more details of an utterance. We achieve the best Equal Error Rate (EER) of 9.67\\% in the physical access (PA) scenario and 8.94\\% in the Deep fake task on the ASVspoof 2021 dataset.

To address the issue, we design a new Two-stage Progressive Residual Dense Attention Network (TSP-RDANet) for image denoising, which divides the whole process of denoising into two sub-tasks to remove noise progressively. Two different attention mechanism-based denoising networks are designed for the two sequential sub-tasks: the residual dense attention module (RDAM) is designed for the first stage, and the hybrid dilated residual dense attention module (HDRDAM) is proposed for the second stage. The proposed attention modules are able to learn appropriate local features through dense connection between different convolutional layers, and the irrelevant features can also be suppressed. The two sub-networks are then connected by a long skip connection to retain the shallow feature to enhance the denoising performance.

This approach employs deep neural networks representing a dedicated encoder at the transmitter and multiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle diverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input reconstruction, and integrated sensing and communications. To extend the applicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision the deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning addresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging federated learning techniques that distribute model updates across decentralized nodes.

In particular, it is assumed that an RIS is near the transmitter vehicle and another RIS is close to the receiver vehicles to provide a wider smart radio environment. Besides, we suppose that the channels between two RISs suffer from the Fisher-Snedecor F fading model. Under this scenario, we first provide the marginal distributions of equivalent channels at the legitimate receiver vehicles by exploiting the central limit theorem (CLT). Then, in order to evaluate the PLS performance of the considered secure communication system, we derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by using the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and the Gaussian quadrature techniques. Moreover, to gain more insights into the secrecy performance, the asymptotic expression of the ASC is obtained. The numerical results indicate that incorporating the dual RIS in the secure V2V communication under the NOMA scheme can significantly provide ultra-reliable transmission and guarantee more secure communication for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).", "authors": "Farshad Rostami Ghadi, Masoud Kaveh, Kai-Kit Wong, Diego Martin", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

In order to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs, we formulate a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem under constraints on the per-AP transmit power, quality-of-service rate requirements, maximum fronthaul signalling load, and maximum number of UEs served by each AP. In order to solve the formulated problem efficiently, we propose two different schemes according to the different sizes of the CFmMIMO systems.

For large-scale CFmMIMO systems, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm using accelerated projected gradient (APG) techniques. Numerical results show that our JointCFNet can yield similar performance and significantly decrease the run time compared with the SCA algorithm in small-scale systems. The presented APG approach is confirmed to run much faster than the SCA algorithm in the large-scale system while obtaining an SE performance close to that of the SCA approach.

As both the inputs and outputs are discrete, we can greatly improve the training efficiency compared to the standard VSR training. Specifically, the input data size is reduced to 0.016% of the original video inputs. In order to complement the insufficient visual information in speech recognition, we apply curriculum learning where the inputs of the system begin with audio-visual speech units and gradually change to visual speech units. After pre-training, the model is finetuned on continuous features. We set new state-of-the-art multilingual VSR performances by achieving comparable performances to the previous language-specific VSR models, with a single trained model.", "authors": "Minsu Kim, Jeong Hun Yeo, Jeongsoo Choi, Se Jin Park, Yong Man Ro", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

Ensuring the robustness of NR-IQA methods is vital for reliable comparisons of different image processing techniques and consistent user experiences in recommendations. The attack methods for NR-IQA provide a powerful instrument to test the robustness of NR-IQA. However, current attack methods of NR-IQA heavily rely on the gradient of the NR-IQA model, leading to limitations when the gradient information is unavailable. In this paper, we present a pioneering query-based black box attack against NR-IQA methods. We propose the concept of score boundary and leverage an adaptive iterative approach with multiple score boundaries. Meanwhile, the initial attack directions are also designed to leverage the characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS). Experiments show our method outperforms all compared state-of-the-art attack methods and is far ahead of previous black-box methods. The effective NR-IQA model DBCNN suffers a Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) decline of 0.6381 attacked by our method, revealing the vulnerability of NR-IQA models to black-box attacks. The proposed attack method also provides a potent tool for further exploration into NR-IQA robustness.", "authors": "Chenxi Yang, Yujia Liu, Dingquan Li, Tingting Jiang", "date": "10 Jan 2024 ("},

Neural network (NN)-based approximations have attracted significant interest due to fast evaluation with good accuracy over long integration time steps. In contrast to established numerical approximation schemes such as Runge-Kutta methods, the estimation of the error of the NN-based approximations proves to be difficult. In this work, we propose to use the NN's predictions in a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) method. The residuals in the implicit system of equations can be related to the NN's prediction error, hence, we can provide an error estimate at several points along a trajectory. We find that this error estimate highly correlates with the NN's prediction error and that increasing the order of the IRK method improves this estimate. We demonstrate this estimation methodology for Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) on the logistic equation as an illustrative example and then apply it to a four-state electric generator model that is regularly used in power system modelling.", "authors": "Jochen Stiasny, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

It is difficult to suppress noise without introducing unwanted artifacts, which adversely affects speaker verification. We proposed the mechanism called Gradient Weighting (Grad-W), which dynamically identifies and reduces artifact noise during prediction. The mechanism is based on the property that the gradient indicates which parts of the input the model is paying attention to. Specifically, when the speaker network focuses on a region in the denoised utterance but not on the clean counterpart, we consider it artifact noise and assign higher weights for this region during optimization of enhancement. We validate it by training an enhancement model and testing the enhanced utterance on speaker verification. The experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces artifact noise, improving speaker verification across various SNR levels.", "authors": "Yi Ma, Kong Aik Lee, Ville Hautamäki, Meng Ge, Haizhou Li", "date": "5 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Guaranteed Nonconvex Factorization Approach for Tensor Train Recovery", "abstract": "In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.", "authors": "Zhen Qin, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu", "date": "5 Jan 2024"},

An Automated Approach to Analyzing Speech in Preschool Classrooms", "abstract": "Young children spend substantial portions of their waking hours in noisy preschool classrooms. In these environments, children's vocal interactions with teachers are critical contributors to their language outcomes, but manually transcribing these interactions is prohibitive. Using audio from child- and teacher-worn recorders, we propose an automated framework that uses open source software both to classify speakers (ALICE) and to transcribe their utterances (Whisper). We compare results from our framework to those from a human expert for 110 minutes of classroom recordings, including 85 minutes from child-word microphones (n=4 children) and 25 minutes from teacher-worn microphones (n=2 teachers). The overall proportion of agreement, that is, the proportion of correctly classified teacher and child utterances, was .76, with an error-corrected kappa of .50 and a weighted F1 of .76. The word error rate for both teacher and child transcriptions was .15, meaning that 15% of words would need to be deleted, added, or changed to equate the Whisper and expert transcriptions. Moreover, speech features such as the mean length of utterances in words, the proportion of teacher and child utterances that were questions, and the proportion of utterances that were responded to within 2.5 seconds were similar when calculated separately from expert and automated transcriptions. The results suggest substantial progress in analyzing classroom speech that may support children's language development.

Determining an appropriate transmission strategy that satisfies ultra-reliability constraint necessitates derivation of statistics of channel in ultra-reliable region and, subsequently, integration of these statistics into rate selection while incorporating a confidence interval to account for potential uncertainties that may arise during estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ultra-reliable real-time transmission considering both spatial diversities and ultra-reliable channel statistics based on multivariate extreme value theory. First, tail distribution of joint received power sequences obtained from different receivers is modeled while incorporating inter-relations of extreme events occurring rarely based on Poisson point process approach in MEVT. The optimum transmission strategies are then developed by determining optimum transmission rate based on estimated joint tail distribution and incorporating confidence intervals into estimations to cope with the availability of limited data. Finally, system reliability is assessed by utilizing outage probability metric. Through analysis of data obtained from the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, our study showcases the effectiveness of proposed methodology in surpassing traditional extrapolation-based approaches. This innovative method not only achieves a higher transmission rate, but also effectively addresses stringent requirements of ultra-reliability.

We demonstrate for improving the analysis of intravoxel incoherent motion imaging (IVIM) magnetic resonance (MR) images, using image denoising and a quantitative approach that does not require imposing specific exponential models. IVIM images were acquired for 13 head-and-neck patients prior to radiotherapy. Of these, 5 patients also had post-radiotherapy scans acquired. Image quality was improved prior to parameter fitting via denoising. For this, we employed neural blind deconvolution, a method of undertaking the ill-posed mathematical problem of blind deconvolution using neural networks. The signal decay curve was then quantified in terms of area under the curve ($AUC$) parameters. Denoised images were assessed in terms of blind image quality metrics, and correlations between their derived parameters in parotid glands with radiotherapy dose levels. We assessed the method's ability to recover artificial pseudokernels which had been applied to denoised images. $AUC$ parameters were compared with the apparent diffusion coefficient ($ADC$), biexponential, and triexponential model parameters, in terms of their correlations with dose, and their relative contributions to the total variance of the dataset, obtained through singular value decomposition. Image denoising resulted in improved blind image quality metrics, and higher correlations between IVIM parameters and dose. $AUC$ parameters were more correlated with dose than traditional IVIM parameters, and captured the highest proportion of the dataset's variance.

To tackle these issues, we introduce a new method named \"CTVC\" which utilizes disentangled speech representations with contrastive learning and time-invariant retrieval. Specifically, a similarity-based compression module is used to facilitate a more intimate connection between the frame-level hidden features and linguistic information at phoneme-level. Additionally, a time-invariant retrieval is proposed for timbre extraction based on multiple segmentations and mutual information. Experimental results demonstrate that \"CTVC\" outperforms previous studies and improves the sound quality and similarity of converted results.", "authors": "Yimin Deng, Huaizhen Tang, Xulong Zhang, Ning Cheng, Jing Xiao, Jianzong Wang", "date": "16 Jan 2024 ("},

Recent advancements in EVC have involved the simultaneous modeling of pitch and duration, utilizing the potential of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. To enhance reliability and efficiency in conversion, this study shifts focus towards parallel speech generation. We introduce Duration-Flexible EVC (DurFlex-EVC), which integrates a style autoencoder and unit aligner. Traditional models, while incorporating self-supervised learning (SSL) representations that contain both linguistic and paralinguistic information, have neglected this dual nature, leading to reduced controllability. Addressing this issue, we implement cross-attention to synchronize these representations with various emotions. Additionally, a style autoencoder is developed for the disentanglement and manipulation of style elements. The efficacy of our approach is validated through both subjective and objective evaluations, establishing its superiority over existing models in the field.", "authors": "Hyoung-Seok Oh, Sang-Hoon Lee, Deok-Hyun Cho, Seong-Whan Lee", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

While transfer learning techniques have exhibited promising outcomes, they still encounter challenges related to inadequate feature representations and may overlook the fact that source subjects themselves can possess distinct characteristics. In this work, we propose a multi-source domain adaptation approach with a transformer-based feature generator (MSDA-TF) designed to leverage information from multiple sources. The proposed feature generator retains convolutional layers to capture shallow spatial, temporal, and spectral EEG data representations, while self-attention mechanisms extract global dependencies within these features. During the adaptation process, we group the source subjects based on correlation values and aim to align the moments of the target subject with each source as well as within the sources.

Due to the dynamic nature of human behaviours, continual learning promises HAR systems that are tailored to users' needs. However, because of the difficulty in collecting labelled data with wearable sensors, existing approaches that focus on supervised continual learning have limited applicability, while unsupervised continual learning methods only handle representation learning while delaying classifier training to a later stage. This work explores the adoption and adaptation of CaSSLe, a continual self-supervised learning model, and Kaizen, a semi-supervised continual learning model that balances representation learning and down-stream classification, for the task of wearable-based HAR. These schemes re-purpose contrastive learning for knowledge retention and, Kaizen combines that with self-training in a unified scheme that can leverage unlabelled and labelled data for continual learning. In addition to comparing state-of-the-art self-supervised continual learning schemes, we further investigated the importance of different loss terms and explored the trade-off between knowledge retention and learning from new tasks. In particular, our extensive evaluation demonstrated that the use of a weighting factor that reflects the ratio between learned and new classes achieves the best overall trade-off in continual learning.", "authors": "Chi Ian Tang, Lorena Qendro, Dimitris Spathis, Fahim Kawsar, Akhil Mathur, Cecilia Mascolo", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},

Unmodeled aerodynamic drag forces from carried payloads can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Prior work model aerodynamic effects as residual dynamics or external disturbances in the control problem leading to a reactive policy that could be catastrophic. Moreover, redesigning controllers and tuning control gains on hardware platforms is a laborious effort. In this paper, we argue that adapting the trajectory generation component keeping the controller fixed can improve trajectory tracking for quadrotor systems experiencing drag forces. To achieve this, we formulate a drag-aware planning problem by applying a suitable relaxation to an optimal quadrotor control problem, introducing a tracking cost function which measures the ability of a controller to follow a reference trajectory. This tracking cost function acts as a regularizer in trajectory generation and is learned from data obtained from simulation. Our experiments in both simulation and on the Crazyflie hardware platform show that changing the planner reduces tracking error by as much as 83%. Evaluation on hardware demonstrates that our planned path, as opposed to a baseline, avoids controller saturation and catastrophic outcomes during aggressive maneuvers.", "authors": "Hanli Zhang, Anusha Srikanthan, Spencer Folk, Vijay Kumar, Nikolai Matni", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

Traditionally, DR is monitored using Color Fundus Photography (CFP), a widespread 2-D imaging modality. However, DR classifications based on CFP have poor predictive power, resulting in suboptimal DR management. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a recent 3-D imaging modality offering enhanced structural and functional information (blood flow) with a wider field of view. This paper investigates automatic DR severity assessment using 3-D OCTA. A straightforward solution to this task is a 3-D neural network classifier. However, 3-D architectures have numerous parameters and typically require many training samples. A lighter solution consists in using 2-D neural network classifiers processing 2-D en-face (or frontal) projections and/or 2-D cross-sectional slices. Such an approach mimics the way ophthalmologists analyze OCTA acquisitions: 1) en-face flow maps are often used to detect avascular zones and neovascularization, and 2) cross-sectional slices are commonly analyzed to detect macular edemas, for instance. However, arbitrary data reduction or selection might result in information loss. Two complementary strategies are thus proposed to optimally summarize OCTA volumes with 2-D images: 1) a parametric en-face projection optimized through deep learning and 2) a cross-sectional slice selection process controlled through gradient-based attribution. The full summarization and DR classification pipeline is trained from end to end. The automatic 2-D summary can be displayed in a viewer or printed in a report to support the decision.

We compared our approach with widely used background removal methods, such as the median background removal or the rolling ball algorithm, on two commonly used STORM datasets, one glial cell, and one microtubule dataset. The SLNet delivers STORM frames with less background, leading to higher emitters' localization precision and higher-resolution reconstructed images than commonly used methods. Notably, the SLNet is lightweight and easily trainable (<5 min). Since it is trained in an unsupervised manner, no prior information is required and can be applied to any STORM dataset.

{"title": "Sampled-Data Primal-Dual Gradient Dynamics in Model Predictive Control", "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a versatile approach capable of accommodating diverse control requirements, holding significant promise for a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Noteworthy challenges associated with MPC include the substantial computational burden and the inherent difficulty in ensuring system stability. Recently, a rapid computation technique has been introduced as a potential solution. This method guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing the primal-dual gradient (PDG) dynamics as a controller. Furthermore, stability assurances grounded in dissipativity theory have been established. However, these assurances are applicable solely to continuous-time feedback systems. As a consequence, when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system, stability cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller, incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach, and present stability conditions relevant to the resulting sampled-data system. Additionally, we introduce an extension designed to enhance control performance. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method not only enhances control effectiveness but also effectively discerns stability degradation resulting from discretization, a nuance often overlooked by conventional methods.", "authors": "Ryuta Moriyasu, Sho Kawaguchi, Kenji Kashima", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

A Gaussian Process (GP) is used to model the occupancy and is represented as a state space model that is equivalent to the full GP if Kalman filtering and smoothing is used.

{"title": "An event-based implementation of saliency-based visual attention for rapid scene analysis", "abstract": "Selective attention is an essential mechanism to filter sensory input and to select only its most important components, allowing the capacity-limited cognitive structures of the brain to process them in detail. The saliency map model, originally developed to understand the process of selective attention in the primate visual system, has also been extensively used in computer vision. Due to the wide-spread use of frame-based video, this is how dynamic input from non-stationary scenes is commonly implemented in saliency maps. However, the temporal structure of this input modality is very different from that of the primate visual system. Retinal input to the brain is massively parallel, local rather than frame-based, asynchronous rather than synchronous, and transmitted in the form of discrete events, neuronal action potentials (spikes). These features are captured by event-based cameras. We show that a computational saliency model can be obtained organically from such vision sensors, at minimal computational cost. We assess the performance of the model by comparing its predictions with the distribution of overt attention (fixations) of human observers, and we make available an event-based dataset that can be used as ground truth for future studies.", "authors": "Camille Simon Chane, Ernst Niebur, Ryad Benosman, Sio-Hoi Ieng", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Pseudorange Rigidity and Solvability of Cooperative GNSS Positioning", "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are a widely used technology for positioning and navigation. GNSS positioning relies on pseudorange measurements from satellites to receivers. A pseudorange is the apparent distance between two agents deduced from the time-of-flight of a signal sent from one agent to the other. Because of the lack of synchronization between the agents' clocks, it is a biased version of their distance. This paper introduces a new rigidity theory adapted to pseudorange measurements. The peculiarity of pseudoranges is that they are asymmetrical measurements. Therefore, unlike other usual rigidities, the graphs of pseudorange frameworks are directed. In this paper, pseudorange rigidity is proved to be a generic property of the underlying undirected graph of constraints. The main result is a characterization of rigid pseudorange graphs as combinations of rigid distance graphs and connected graphs. This new theory is adapted for GNSS. It provides new insights into the minimum number of satellites needed to locate a receiver, and is applied to the localization of GNSS cooperative networks of receivers. The interests of asymmetrical constraints in the context of formation control are also discussed.", "authors": "Colin Cros, Pierre-Olivier Amblard, Christophe Prieur, Jean-François Da Rocha", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

For such a channel mapping task, inspired by the intrinsic coupling across the space and frequency domains, this letter proposes to use interleaved learning with partial antenna and subcarrier characteristics to represent the whole MIMO-OFDM channel. Specifically, we design a complex-domain multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer (CMixer), which utilizes two kinds of complex-domain MLP modules to learn the space and frequency characteristics respectively and then interleaves them to couple the learned properties. The complex-domain computation facilitates the learning on the complex-valued channel data, while the interleaving tightens the coupling of space and frequency domains. These two designs jointly reduce the learning burden, making the physics-inspired CMixer more effective on channel representation learning than existing data-driven approaches. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme brings 4.6~10dB gains in mapping accuracy compared to existing schemes under different settings. Besides, ablation studies show the necessity of complex-domain computation as well as the extent to which the interleaved learning matches the channel properties.", "authors": "Zirui Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Lei Liu", "date": "7 Jan 2024"},

Data-driven techniques, on the other hand, have become a viable alternative for the design and analysis of unknown systems using only data. In this context, a novel data-driven distributed unknown-input observer (D-DUIO) for an unknown linear system is developed, which leverages solely some data collected offline, without any prior knowledge of the system matrices. In the paper, first, the design of a DUIO is investigated by resorting to a traditional model-based approach. By resorting to a Lyapunov equation, it is proved that under some conditions, the state estimates at all nodes of the DUIO achieve consensus and collectively converge to the state of the system. Moving to a data-driven approach, it is shown that the input/output/state trajectories of the system are compatible with the equations of a D-DUIO, and this allows, under suitable assumptions, to express the matrices of a possible DUIO in terms of the matrices of pre-collected data. Then, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed D-DUIO are given.

Using data information collected off-line instead of accurate system model information, a data-driven dynamic event-triggered control scheme is developed in this paper. The dynamic property is reflected by that the designed event-triggering function embedded in the event-triggering mechanism (ETM) is dynamically updated as a whole. Thanks to this dynamic design, a strictly positive minimum inter-event time (MIET) is guaranteed without sacrificing control performance. Specifically, exponential input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system with respect to disturbances is achieved in this paper, which is superior to some existing results that only guarantee a practical exponential ISS property. The dynamic ETM is easy-to-implement in practical operation since all designed parameters are determined only by a simple data-driven linear matrix inequality (LMI), without additional complicated conditions as required in relevant literature. As quantization is the most common signal constraint in practice, the developed control scheme is further extended to the case where state transmission is affected by a uniform or logarithmic quantization effect.

To unveil the multiplexing capabilities of FAS, proper (simple yet accurate) modeling of the spatial correlation is prominently needed. Realistic classical models such as Jakes' are prohibitively complex, rendering intractable analyses, while state-of-the-art approximations often are too simplistic and poorly accurate. Aiming to fill this gap, we here propose a general framework to approximate spatial correlation by block-diagonal matrices, motivated by the well-known block fading assumption and by statistical results on large correlation matrices.

This system typically acquires the surrounding sound field by means of a microphone array. Signals acquired by the array are then processed using various methods. One of the widely applied methods is direction of arrival estimation. The conventional direction of arrival estimation methods assume that the array is fixed at a given position during the estimation. However, this is not necessarily true for an array installed on a moving humanoid robot. The array motion, if not accounted for appropriately, can introduce a significant error in the estimated direction of arrival. The current paper presents a signal model that takes the motion into account. Based on this model, two processing methods are proposed. The first one compensates for the motion of the robot. The second method is applicable to periodic signals and utilizes the motion in order to enhance the performance to a level beyond that of a stationary array. Numerical simulations and an experimental study are provided, demonstrating that the motion compensation method almost eliminates the motion-related error.

In this review, we first present a systematic literature overview of studies using machine learning and multimodal MRI to unravel disease heterogeneity in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, as well as their potential in transdiagnostic settings. Subsequently, we summarize relevant machine learning methodologies and discuss an emerging paradigm which we call dimensional neuroimaging endophenotype (DNE). DNE dissects the neurobiological heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders into a low dimensional yet informative, quantitative brain phenotypic representation, serving as a robust intermediate phenotype (i.e., endophenotype) largely reflecting underlying genetics and etiology. Finally, we discuss the potential clinical implications of the current findings and envision future research avenues.", "authors": "Junhao Wen, Mathilde Antoniades, Zhijian Yang, Gyujoon Hwang, Ioanna Skampardoni, Rongguang Wang, Christos Davatzikos", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Therefore, the ability to detect tumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep learning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging situations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML) comprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The detection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive tasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and pre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients of each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with real world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the testing, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to Patient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the detection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor region. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both in Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification phase. This approach demonstrates promising strides in reliable tumor detection and classification, offering potential advancements in tumor diagnosis for real-world medical imaging scenarios.", "authors": "Seyed Mohammad Hossein Hashemi, Leila Safari, Amirhossein Dadashzade Taromi", "date": "6 Jan 2024 ("},
{"title": "Multi-Agent Context Learning Strategy for Interference-Aware Beam Allocation in mmWave Vehicular Communications", "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) has been recognized as one of key technologies for 5G and beyond networks due to its potential to enhance channel bandwidth and network capacity. The use of mmWave for various applications including vehicular communications has been extensively discussed. However, applying mmWave to vehicular communications faces challenges of high mobility nodes and narrow coverage along the mmWave beams. Due to high mobility in dense networks, overlapping beams can cause strong interference which leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, beam switching capability in mmWave can be utilized. Then, frequent beam switching and cell change become inevitable to manage interference, which increase computational and signalling complexity. In order to deal with the complexity in interference control, we develop a new strategy called Multi-Agent Context Learning (MACOL), which utilizes Contextual Bandit to manage interference while allocating mmWave beams to serve vehicles in the network. Our approach demonstrates that by leveraging knowledge of neighbouring beam status, the machine learning agent can identify and avoid potential interfering transmissions to other ongoing transmissions. Furthermore, we show that even under heavy traffic loads, our proposed MACOL strategy is able to maintain low interference levels at around 10%.", "authors": "Abdulkadir Kose, Haeyoung Lee, Chuan Heng Foh, Mohammad Shojafar", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a fundamental diagnostic tool, but traditional analysis relies on time-intensive expert evaluation. Recently, deep learning has shown immense potential for automating pneumonia detection from CXRs. This paper explores applying neural networks to improve CXR-based pneumonia diagnosis. We developed a novel model fusing Convolution Neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer networks via model-level ensembling. Our fusion architecture combines a ResNet34 variant and a Multi-Axis Vision Transformer small model. Both base models are initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights. The output layers are removed, and features are combined using a flattening layer before final classification. Experiments used the Kaggle pediatric pneumonia dataset containing 1,341 normal and 3,875 pneumonia CXR images. We compared our model against standalone ResNet34, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer Tiny baseline models using identical training procedures. Extensive data augmentation, Adam optimization, learning rate warmup, and decay were employed. The fusion model achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.87%, surpassing the baselines. We also attained excellent sensitivity, specificity, kappa score, and positive predictive value. Confusion matrix analysis confirms fewer misclassifications. The ResNet34 and Vision Transformer combination enables jointly learning robust features from CNNs and Transformer paradigms.

The literature provides frameworks for designing SMAs and SLAs separately, including error analysis from which the operating frequency range (OFR) of an array is defined. However, such a framework does not exist for the joint design of a SMA and a SLA that comprise a MIMO system. This paper develops a design framework for MIMO systems based on a model that addresses errors and highlights the importance of a matched design. Expanding on a free-field assumption, errors are incorporated separately for each array and error bounds are defined, facilitating error analysis for the system. The dependency of the error bounds on the SLA and SMA parameters is studied and it is recommended that parameters should be chosen to assure matched OFRs of the arrays in MIMO system design.

AI-based detection can help to address these challenges by automatically differentiating between genuine and fabricated voice recordings. However, these models are only as good as their training data, which currently is severely limited due to an overwhelming concentration on English and Chinese audio in anti-spoofing databases, thus restricting its worldwide effectiveness. In response, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoof Dataset (MLAAD), created using 52 TTS models, comprising 19 different architectures, to generate 160.1 hours of synthetic voice in 23 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD, and observe that MLAAD demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild or FakeOrReal when used as a training resource. Furthermore, in comparison with the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, both excelling on four datasets.

NORTH is built upon the gradient-based active-set methods from the numerical optimization literature but with new methods to manage active constraints for the non-differentiable schedulability constraints. In addition, we also generalize NORTH to NORTH+, to collaboratively optimize certain types of discrete variables (\\eg priority assignments, categorical variables) with continuous variables based on numerical optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the algorithm performance with two example applications: energy minimization based on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and optimization of control system performance. In these experiments, NORTH achieved $10^2$ to $10^5$ times speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar or better solution quality.

Previous studies have shown that such a network can be targeted by adversarial attacks causing traffic jams or safety violations ending in collisions. We focus on attacks targeting the V2X communication network used to share vehicle data and consider as well uncertainties due to noise in sensor measurements and communication channels. To combat these, motivated by recent work on the safe control of CAVs, we propose a trust-aware robust event-triggered decentralized control and coordination framework that can provably guarantee safety. We maintain a trust metric for each vehicle in the network computed based on their behavior and used to balance the tradeoff between conservativeness (when deeming every vehicle as untrustworthy) and guaranteed safety and security. It is important to highlight that our framework is invariant to the specific choice of the trust framework. Based on this framework, we propose an attack detection and mitigation scheme which has twofold benefits: (i) the trust framework is immune to false positives, and (ii) it provably guarantees safety against false positive cases.

{"title": "Deep Covariance Alignment for Domain Adaptive Remote Sensing Image Segmentation", "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) image segmentation has recently gained increasing attention, aiming to improve the generalization capability for transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. However, in high spatial resolution remote sensing image (RSI), the same category from different domains (\\emph{e.g.}, urban and rural) can appear to be totally different with extremely inconsistent distributions, which heavily limits the UDA accuracy. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Covariance Alignment (DCA) model for UDA RSI segmentation. The DCA can explicitly align category features to learn shared domain-invariant discriminative feature representations, which enhances the ability of model generalization. Specifically, a Category Feature Pooling (CFP) module is first employed to extract category features by combining the coarse outputs and the deep features. Then, we leverage a novel Covariance Regularization (CR) to enforce the intra-category features to be closer and the inter-category features to be further separate. Compared with the existing category alignment methods, our CR aims to regularize the correlation between different dimensions of the features and thus performs more robustly when dealing with the divergent category features of imbalanced and inconsistent distributions. Finally, we propose a stagewise procedure to train the DCA in order to alleviate the error accumulation.

To address this issue, in this letter, a pure integral-type phase-locked loop (IPLL) with a damping branch is proposed to replace the traditional PI-type PLL. The equivalent damping coefficient of an IPLL-synchronized inverter is decoupled with the steady-state power angle. As a result, the IPLL-synchronized inverter can stably operate under an ultra-weak grid when the equilibrium point exists. Finally, time-domain simulation results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed IPLL.", "authors": "Yi Zhou, Zhouchen Deng, Shi Chen, Yiwei Qiu, Tianlei Zang, Buxiang Zhou", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Short-Time Fourier Transform for deblurring Variational Autoencoders", "abstract": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models, however their generated samples are known to suffer from a characteristic blurriness, as compared to the outputs of alternative generating techniques. Extensive research efforts have been made to tackle this problem, and several works have focused on modifying the reconstruction term of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). In particular, many have experimented with augmenting the reconstruction loss with losses in the frequency domain. Such loss functions usually employ the Fourier transform to explicitly penalise the lack of higher frequency components in the generated samples, which are responsible for sharp visual features. In this paper, we explore the aspects of previous such approaches which aren't well understood, and we propose an augmentation to the reconstruction term in response to them. Our reasoning leads us to use the short-time Fourier transform and to emphasise on local phase coherence between the input and output samples. We illustrate the potential of our proposed loss on the MNIST dataset by providing both qualitative and quantitative results.", "authors": "Vibhu Dalal", "date": "6 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "To Balance or to Not? Battery Aging-Aware Active Cell Balancing for Electric Vehicles", "abstract": "Due to manufacturing variabilities and temperature gradients within an electric vehicle's battery pack, the capacities of cells in it decrease differently over time. This reduces the usable capacity of the battery - the charge levels of one or more cells might be at the minimum threshold while most of the other cells have residual charge. Active cell balancing (i.e., transferring charge among cells) can equalize their charge levels, thereby increasing the battery pack's usable capacity. But performing balancing means additional charge transfer, which can result in energy loss and cell aging, akin to memory aging in storage technologies due to writing. This paper studies when cell balancing should be optimally triggered to minimize aging while maintaining the necessary driving capability. In particular, we propose optimization strategies for cell balancing while minimizing their impact on aging.

{"title": "OFDM-Based Digital Semantic Communication with Importance Awareness", "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has received considerable attention for its ability to reduce data transmission size while maintaining task performance. However, existing works mainly focus on analog SemCom with simple channel models, which may limit its practical application. To reduce this gap, we propose an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based SemCom system that is compatible with existing digital communication infrastructures. In the considered system, the extracted semantics is quantized by scalar quantizers, transformed into OFDM signal, and then transmitted over the frequency-selective channel. Moreover, we propose a semantic importance measurement method to build the relationship between target task and semantic features. Based on semantic importance, we formulate a sub-carrier and bit allocation problem to maximize communication performance. However, the optimization objective function cannot be accurately characterized using a mathematical expression due to the neural network-based semantic codec. Given the complex nature of the problem, we first propose a low-complexity sub-carrier allocation method that assigns sub-carriers with better channel conditions to more critical semantics. Then, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based bit allocation algorithm with dynamic action space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves 9.7% and 28.7% performance gains compared to analog SemCom and conventional bit-based communication systems, respectively.", "authors": "Chuanhong Liu, Caili Guo, Yang Yang, Wanli Ni, Tony Q.S.

The tendency describes an executive summary of a signal that encapsulates its notable characteristics while disregarding seemingly random, less interesting aspects. Building upon the Intrinsic Time Decomposition (ITD) and information-theoretical analysis, we introduce two alternative procedures for selecting the tendency from the ITD baselines. The first is based on the maximum extrema prominence, namely the maximum difference between extrema within each baseline. Specifically this method selects the tendency as the baseline from which an ITD step would produce the largest decline of the maximum prominence. The second method uses the rotations from the ITD and selects the tendency as the last baseline for which the associated rotation is statistically stationary. We delve into a comparative analysis of the information content and interpretability of the tendencies obtained by our proposed methods and those obtained through conventional low-pass filtering schemes, particularly the Hodrik-Prescott (HP) filter. Our findings underscore a fundamental distinction in the nature and interpretability of these tendencies, highlighting their context-dependent utility with emphasis in multi-scale signals.

These variations limit the feasibility and robustness of generalizing population-wise features of eye organs to an unbiased spatial reference. To tackle these limitations, we propose a process for creating high-resolution unbiased eye atlases. First, to restore spatial details from scans with a low through-plane resolution compared to a high in-plane resolution, we apply a deep learning-based super-resolution algorithm. Then, we generate an initial unbiased reference with an iterative metric-based registration using a small portion of subject scans. We register the remaining scans to this template and refine the template using an unsupervised deep probabilistic approach that generates a more expansive deformation field to enhance the organ boundary alignment. We demonstrate this framework using magnetic resonance images across four different MRI tissue contrasts, generating four atlases in separate spatial alignments. For each tissue contrast, we find a significant improvement in the average Dice score across four labeled regions compared to a standard registration framework consisting of rigid, affine, and deformable transformations.

Unlike existing methods, which often assume that the constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can handle coupled time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential infeasibilities. First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints essentially boils down to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable, representing the signed distance from the boundary of the time-varying output-constrained set. To achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is designed that, when satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the time-varying output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a novel robust and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the satisfaction of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a mechanism for online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a least violating solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for some time.

Each agent receives data comprising of samples of an independent variable (input) and the corresponding values of the dependent variable (output). The data remains local and is not shared with other members in the system. The objective of the system is to collaboratively estimate the function from the input to the output. To this end, we develop an iterative distributed algorithm for this function estimation problem. Each agent solves a local estimation problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and uploads the function to the fusion center. At the fusion center, the functions are fused by first estimating the data points that would have generated the uploaded functions and then subsequently solving a least squares estimation problem using the estimated data from both functions. The fused function is downloaded by the agents and is subsequently used for estimation at the next iteration along with incoming data. This procedure is executed sequentially and stopped when the difference between consecutively estimated functions becomes small enough. To analyze the algorithm, we define learning operators for the agents, fusion center and the system. We study the asymptotic properties of the norm of the learning operators and find sufficient conditions under which they converge to $1$.

Domain generalization (DG) methods, which aim to train models on multiple domains to perform well on unseen domains, offer a promising direction to solve the problem. However, existing DG methods assume domain labels of each image are available and accurate, which is typically feasible for only a limited number of medical datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel DG framework for medical image classification without relying on domain labels, called Prompt-driven Latent Domain Generalization (PLDG). PLDG consists of unsupervised domain discovery and prompt learning. This framework first discovers pseudo domain labels by clustering the bias-associated style features, then leverages collaborative domain prompts to guide a Vision Transformer to learn knowledge from discovered diverse domains. To facilitate cross-domain knowledge learning between different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generator that enables knowledge sharing between domain prompts and a shared prompt. A domain mixup strategy is additionally employed for more flexible decision margins and mitigates the risk of incorrect domain assignments.

Given the gradual increase in model size and the wide range of model applications, selectively executing model components for different inputs to improve the inference efficiency is of great interest.

Furthermore, we factorize the CTC output distribution and perform knowledge distillation on intermediate layers to reduce computation and improve recognition accuracy.

{"title": "Hyperspectral Image Denoising via Spatial-Spectral Recurrent Transformer", "abstract": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from noise arising from both intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Leveraging domain knowledge specific to HSIs, such as global spectral correlation (GSC) and non-local spatial self-similarity (NSS), is crucial for effective denoising. Existing methods tend to independently utilize each of these knowledge components with multiple blocks, overlooking the inherent 3D nature of HSIs where domain knowledge is strongly interlinked, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a spatial-spectral recurrent transformer U-Net (SSRT-UNet) for HSI denoising. The proposed SSRT-UNet integrates NSS and GSC properties within a single SSRT block. This block consists of a spatial branch and a spectral branch. The spectral branch employs a combination of transformer and recurrent neural network to perform recurrent computations across bands, allowing for GSC exploitation beyond a fixed number of bands. Concurrently, the spatial branch encodes NSS for each band by sharing keys and values with the spectral branch under the guidance of GSC. This interaction between the two branches enables the joint utilization of NSS and GSC, avoiding their independent treatment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms several alternative approaches.

{"title": "State Derivative Normalization for Continuous-Time Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "The importance of proper data normalization for deep neural networks is well known. However, in continuous-time state-space model estimation, it has been observed that improper normalization of either the hidden state or hidden state derivative of the model estimate, or even of the time interval can lead to numerical and optimization challenges with deep learning based methods. This results in a reduced model quality. In this contribution, we show that these three normalization tasks are inherently coupled. Due to the existence of this coupling, we propose a solution to all three normalization challenges by introducing a normalization constant at the state derivative level. We show that the appropriate choice of the normalization constant is related to the dynamics of the to-be-identified system and we derive multiple methods of obtaining an effective normalization constant. We compare and discuss all the normalization strategies on a benchmark problem based on experimental data from a cascaded tanks system and compare our results with other methods of the identification literature.", "authors": "Jonas Weigand, Gerben I.

Existing works on opacity for control systems only provide a binary characterization of the system's security level by determining whether the system is opaque or not. In this work, we introduce a quantifiable measure of opacity that considers the likelihood of satisfying opacity for stochastic control systems modeled as general Markov decision processes (gMDPs). We also propose verification methods tailored to the new notions of opacity for finite gMDPs by using value iteration techniques. Then, a new notion called approximate opacity-preserving stochastic simulation relation is proposed, which captures the distance between two systems' behaviors in terms of preserving opacity. Based on this new system relation, we show that one can verify opacity for stochastic control systems using their abstractions (modeled as finite gMDPs).

Representative period selection is an important component of capacity expansion modeling, enabling computational tractability of optimization while ensuring fidelity between the representative periods and the full year.

This prevents the capacity expansion model from directly simulating interday energy sharing, which is of key importance as energy generation becomes more variable and storage more important. To this end, we propose a novel method for selecting representative periods of any length.

To address the computational challenges of CS reconstruction, our objective is to develop an interpretable and concise neural network model for reconstructing natural images using CS. We achieve this by mapping one step of the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to a deep network block, representing one iteration of ISTA. To enhance learning ability and incorporate structural diversity, we integrate aggregated residual transformations (ResNeXt) and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanisms into the ISTA block. This block serves as a deep equilibrium layer, connected to a semi-tensor product network (STP-Net) for convenient sampling and providing an initial reconstruction. The resulting model, called MsDC-DEQ-Net, exhibits competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art network-based methods. It significantly reduces storage requirements compared to deep unrolling methods, using only one iteration block instead of multiple iterations. Unlike deep unrolling models, MsDC-DEQ-Net can be iteratively used, gradually improving reconstruction accuracy while considering computation trade-offs.

First, the available real-world datasets are biased towards the most frequently used appliances. Second, both real and synthetic publicly-available datasets are limited in number of appliances, which may not be sufficient for a disaggregation algorithm to learn complex relations among different types of appliances and their states. To address the lack of appliance data, we propose two physics-informed data generators: one for high sampling rate signals (kHz) and another for low sampling rate signals (Hz). These generators rely on prior knowledge of the physics of appliance energy consumption, and are capable of simulating a virtually unlimited number of different appliances and their corresponding signatures for any time period. Both methods involve defining a mathematical model, selecting centroids corresponding to individual appliances, sampling model parameters around each centroid, and finally substituting the obtained parameters into the mathematical model.

The adversary can gain illegitimate control of a large number of these devices and use them as a means to compromise the physical grid operation, a mechanism known as the IoT botnet attack. This paper aims to improve the resiliency of cyber-physical power grids to such attacks. Specifically, we use an epidemic model to understand the dynamic botnet formation, which facilitates the assessment of the cyber layer vulnerability of the grid. The attacker aims to exploit this vulnerability to enable a successful physical compromise, while the system operator's goal is to ensure a normal operation of the grid by mitigating cyber risks. We develop a cross-layer game-theoretic framework for strategic decision-making to enhance cyber-physical grid resiliency. The cyber-layer game guides the system operator on how to defend against the botnet attacker as the first layer of defense, while the dynamic game strategy at the physical layer further counteracts the adversarial behavior in real time for improved physical resilience.

In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filtering-based tracking scheme for a UAV-enabled ISAC system where a UAV tracks a moving object and also communicates with a device attached to the object. Specifically, a weighted sum of predicted posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) for object relative position and velocity estimation is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory, where an efficient solution is obtained based on the successive convex approximation method. Furthermore, under a special case with the measurement mean square error (MSE), the optimal relative motion state is obtained and proved to keep a fixed elevation angle and zero relative velocity. Numerical results validate that the obtained solution to the predicted PCRB minimization can be approximated by the optimal relative motion state when predicted measurement MSE dominates the predicted PCRBs, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme.

Our approach couples control barrier functions (CBFs) with a new uncertainty/disturbance estimator to ensure robust safety against input and state-dependent model uncertainties. We prove upper bounds on the estimator's error and estimated outputs. We use an uncertainty estimator-based composite feedback control law to adaptively improve robust control performance under hard safety constraints by compensating for the matched uncertainty. Then, we robustify existing CBF constraints with this uncertainty estimate and the estimation error bounds to ensure robust safety via a quadratic program (CBF-QP). We also extend our method to higher-order CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which causes relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbance. We assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a second-order cone (SOC) condition.

{"title": "Moving-Horizon Estimators for Hyperbolic and Parabolic PDEs in 1-D", "abstract": "Observers for PDEs are themselves PDEs. Therefore, producing real time estimates with such observers is computationally burdensome. For both finite-dimensional and ODE systems, moving-horizon estimators (MHE) are operators whose output is the state estimate, while their inputs are the initial state estimate at the beginning of the horizon as well as the measured output and input signals over the moving time horizon. In this paper we introduce MHEs for PDEs which remove the need for a numerical solution of an observer PDE in real time. We accomplish this using the PDE backstepping method which, for certain classes of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, produces moving-horizon state estimates explicitly. Precisely, to explicitly produce the state estimates, we employ a backstepping transformation of a hard-to-solve observer PDE into a target observer PDE, which is explicitly solvable. The MHEs we propose are not new observer designs but simply the explicit MHE realizations, over a moving horizon of arbitrary length, of the existing backstepping observers. Our PDE MHEs lack the optimality of the MHEs that arose as duals of MPC, but they are given explicitly, even for PDEs.

{"title": "On Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs", "abstract": "In graph-theoretical terms, an edge in a graph connects two vertices while a hyperedge of a hypergraph connects any more than one vertices. If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.", "authors": "Shaoxuan Cui, Guofeng Zhang, Hildeberto Jardón-Kojakhmetov, Ming Cao", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "DDD: A Perceptually Superior Low-Response-Time DNN-based Declipper", "abstract": "Clipping is a common nonlinear distortion that occurs whenever the input or output of an audio system exceeds the supported range. This phenomenon undermines not only the perception of speech quality but also downstream processes utilizing the disrupted signal. Therefore, a real-time-capable, robust, and low-response-time method for speech declipping (SD) is desired. In this work, we introduce DDD (Demucs-Discriminator-Declipper), a real-time-capable speech-declipping deep neural network (DNN) that requires less response time by design. We first observe that a previously untested real-time-capable DNN model, Demucs, exhibits a reasonable declipping performance. Then we utilize adversarial learning objectives to increase the perceptual quality of output speech without additional inference overhead. Subjective evaluations on harshly clipped speech shows that DDD outperforms the baselines by a wide margin in terms of speech quality. We perform detailed waveform and spectral analyses to gain an insight into the output behavior of DDD in comparison to the baselines. Finally, our streaming simulations also show that DDD is capable of sub-decisecond mean response times, outperforming the state-of-the-art DNN approach by a factor of six.", "authors": "Jayeon Yi, Junghyun Koo, Kyogu Lee", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Gain Scheduling with a Neural Operator for a Transport PDE with Nonlinear Recirculation", "abstract": "To stabilize PDE models, control laws require space-dependent functional gains mapped by nonlinear operators from the PDE functional coefficients. When a PDE is nonlinear and its \"pseudo-coefficient\" functions are state-dependent, a gain-scheduling (GS) nonlinear design is the simplest approach to the design of nonlinear feedback. The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains obtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE computations in real time may be prohibitive. The recently introduced neural operators (NO) can be trained to produce the gain functions, rapidly in real time, for each state value, without requiring a PDE solution. In this paper we introduce NOs for GS-PDE backstepping. GS controllers act on the premise that the state change is slow and, as a result, guarantee only local stability, even for ODEs. We establish local stabilization of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear recirculation using both a \"full-kernel\" approach and the \"gain-only\" approach to gain operator approximation. Numerical simulations illustrate stabilization and demonstrate speedup by three orders of magnitude over traditional PDE gain-scheduling.

This study introduces a comprehensive system consisting of bee object detection and health evaluation. Additionally, it utilized a combination of visual and audio signals to analyze bee behaviors. An Attention-based Multimodal Neural Network (AMNN) was developed to adaptively focus on key features from each type of signal for accurate bee health assessment.

The role of the public charging station depot is to charge the vehicle, prioritizing the achievement of the desired state of charge (SoC) value for the EV battery or charging till the departure of the EV, whichever occurs first. The integration of cyber and physical components within EVCI defines it as a cyber physical power system (CPPS), increasing its vulnerability to diverse cyber attacks.

{"title": "Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality in Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis", "abstract": "Multi-modal Learning has attracted widespread attention in medical image analysis. Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is not easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited resources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure the training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing modality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to performance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the clinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation framework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The single-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the multi-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI from the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method.

While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data, unsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a scalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning (SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised frameworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online clustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative bottlenecks. Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels through online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the student model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input and model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated via an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past iterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for consistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples. Experiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current iterative approaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single training round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components like noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues.

With the current computational advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data. Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity automatically.

In recent years, deep learning models have been the go-to approach for the segmentation of brain tumors. U-Net and its' variants for semantic segmentation of medical images have achieved good results in the literature. However, U-Net and its' variants tend to over-segment tumor regions and may not accurately segment the tumor edges. The edges of the tumor are as important as the tumor regions for accurate diagnosis, surgical precision, and treatment planning. In the proposed work, the authors aim to extract edges from the ground truth using a derivative-like filter followed by edge reconstruction to obtain an edge ground truth in addition to the brain tumor ground truth. Utilizing both ground truths, the author studies several U-Net and its' variant architectures with and without tumor edges ground truth as a target along with the tumor ground truth for brain tumor segmentation.

LQ problems then become infinite-dimensional semidefinite programs, and the key tool used is that of linear-conic duality. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) emerge naturally as conal constraints on dual problems. Riccati equations characterize extrema of these special LMIs, and therefore provide solutions to the dual problems. The state-feedback structure of all optimal signals in these problems emerge out of alignment (complementary slackness) conditions between primal and dual problems. Perhaps the new insight gained from this approach is that first LMIs, and then second, Riccati equations arise naturally in dual, rather than primal problems. Furthermore, while traditional LQ problems are set up in $L^2$ spaces of signals, their equivalent covariance-representation problems are most naturally set up in $L^1$ spaces of matrix-valued signals.", "authors": "Bassam Bamieh", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Self-Supervised Millimeter Wave Indoor Localization using Tiny Neural Networks", "abstract": "The quasi-optical propagation of millimeter-wave signals enables high-accuracy localization algorithms that employ geometric approaches or machine learning models. However, most algorithms require information on the indoor environment, may entail the collection of large training datasets, or bear an infeasible computational burden for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. In this work, we propose to use tiny neural networks (NNs) to learn the relationship between angle difference-of-arrival (ADoA) measurements and locations of a receiver in an indoor environment. To relieve training data collection efforts, we resort to a self-supervised approach by bootstrapping the training of our neural network through location estimates obtained from a state-of-the-art localization algorithm. We evaluate our scheme via mmWave measurements from indoor 60-GHz double-directional channel sounding. We process the measurements to yield dominant multipath components, use the corresponding angles to compute ADoA values, and finally obtain location fixes. Results show that the tiny NN achieves sub-meter errors in 74\\% of the cases, thus performing as good as or even better than the state-of-the-art algorithm, with significantly lower computational complexity.", "authors": "Anish Shastri, Steve Blandino, Camillo Gentile, Chiehping Lai, Paolo Casari", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},

By incorporating a limited set of experimental room impulse responses as training data, this approach combines neural network processing capabilities with the underlying physics of sound propagation, as articulated by the wave equation. The network's ability to estimate particle velocity and intensity, in addition to sound pressure, demonstrates its capacity to represent the flow of acoustic energy and completely characterise the sound field with only a few measurements. Additionally, an investigation into the potential of this network as a tool for improving acoustic simulations is conducted. This is due to its profficiency in offering grid-free sound field mappings with minimal inference time. Furthermore, a study is carried out which encompasses comparative analyses against current approaches for sound field reconstruction. Specifically, the proposed approach is evaluated against both data-driven techniques and elementary wave-based regression methods. The results demonstrate that the physics-informed neural network stands out when reconstructing the early part of the room impulse response, while simultaneously allowing for complete sound field characterisation in the time domain.", "authors": "Xenofon Karakonstantis, Diego Caviedes-Nozal, Antoine Richard, Efren Fernandez-Grande", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "On the Parameter Estimation of Sinusoidal Models for Speech and Audio Signals", "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the parameter estimation performance of three well-known sinusoidal models for speech and audio. The first one is the standard Sinusoidal Model (SM), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The second is the Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Model (EDSM) which has been proposed in the last decade, and utilizes a subspace method for parameter estimation, and finally the extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model (eaQHM), which has been recently proposed for AM-FM decomposition, and estimates the signal parameters using Least Squares on a set of basis function that are adaptive to the local characteristics of the signal. The parameter estimation of each model is briefly described and its performance is compared to the others in terms of signal reconstruction accuracy versus window size on a variety of synthetic signals and versus the number of sinusoids on real signals. The latter include highly non stationary signals, such as singing voices and guitar solos. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are presented via synthetic signals and then the application on real signals is discussed. Conclusively, eaQHM outperforms EDS in medium-to-large window size analysis, whereas EDSM yields higher reconstruction values for smaller analysis window sizes. Thus, a future research direction appears to be the merge of adaptivity of the eaQHM and parameter estimation robustness of the EDSM in a new paradigm for high-quality analysis and resynthesis of general audio signals.", "authors": "George P.

{"title": "Detecting the presence of sperm whales echolocation clicks in noisy environments", "abstract": "Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) navigate underwater with a series of impulsive, click-like sounds known as echolocation clicks. These clicks are characterized by a multipulse structure (MPS) that serves as a distinctive pattern. In this work, we use the stability of the MPS as a detection metric for recognizing and classifying the presence of clicks in noisy environments. To distinguish between noise transients and to handle simultaneous emissions from multiple sperm whales, our approach clusters a time series of MPS measures while removing potential clicks that do not fulfil the limits of inter-click interval, duration and spectrum. As a result, our approach can handle high noise transients and low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of our detection approach is examined using three datasets: seven months of recordings from the Mediterranean Sea containing manually verified ambient noise; several days of manually labelled data collected from the Dominica Island containing approximately 40,000 clicks from multiple sperm whales; and a dataset from the Bahamas containing 1,203 labelled clicks from a single sperm whale. Comparing with the results of two benchmark detectors, a better trade-off between precision and recall is observed as well as a significant reduction in false detection rates, especially in noisy environments.

{"title": "Socially Compliant Control of Autonomous Vehicles with Application to Eco-Driving", "abstract": "Control design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has mostly focused on achieving a prespecified goal for an individually controlled AV or for a swarm of cooperatively controlled AVs. However, the impact of autonomous driving on human-driven vehicles (HVs) has been largely ignored in AV controller synthesis, which could result in egoistic AV behavior detrimental to the safety of passengers and surrounding traffic. In this study we develop a general framework for socially compliant control design of AVs with a useful metric of social psychology, called social value orientation (SVO), allowing AVs to leverage their impact on the behavior of the following HVs. This is critical since AVs that behave in a socially compliant manner enable human drivers to comprehend their actions and respond appropriately. Within the proposed framework, we define the utilities of the controlled AV and its following vehicle, to be maximized in a weighted fashion determined by the AV's SVO. The utility maximization covers an array of design objectives given the goal of the AV and the benefits for the following HV stemming from the courtesy of socially compliant AV controls. An optimal control problem is then formulated to maximize the utility function defined, which is numerically solved using Pontryagin's minimum principle with optimality guarantees. The methodology developed is applied to synthesize socially compliant control for eco-driving of AVs. A set of numerical results are presented to show the mechanism and effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world experimental data collected on Highway 55 in Minnesota.", "authors": "Shian Wang", "date": "1 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Using DCFT for Multi-Target Detection in Distributed Radar Systems with Several Transmitters", "abstract": "In distributed radar systems, when several transmitters radiate simultaneously, the reflected signals need to be distinguished at the receivers to detect various targets. If the transmit signals are in different frequency bands, they require a large overall bandwidth. Instead, a set of pseudo-orthogonal waveforms derived from the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences could be accommodated in the same band, enabling the efficient use of available bandwidth for better range resolution. In such a design, special care must be given to the 'near-far' problem, where a reflection could possibly become difficult to detect due to the presence of stronger reflections. In this work, a scheme to detect multiple targets in such distributed radar systems is proposed. It performs successive cancellations (SC) starting from the strong, detectable reflections in the domain of the Discrete Chirp-Fourier Transform (DCFT) after compensating for Doppler shifts, enabling the subsequent detections of weaker targets which are not trivially detectable.

The training performance can be improved by characterizing the vertical and horizontal data samples with a large latent feature space, while low-latency communication can be achieved with a reduced number of transmitted parameters during federated learning.

The focus is on control at the transcriptional level, serving as a means to modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes. Recent strategies in this field have employed constraint-based dynamic models for process optimization, control, and estimation. However, this results in bilevel dynamic optimization problems, which pose considerable numerical and conceptual challenges. In this study, we present an alternative hybrid physics-informed dynamic modeling framework for metabolic cybergenetics, aimed at simplifying optimization, control, and estimation tasks. By utilizing machine-learning surrogates, our approach effectively embeds the physics of metabolic networks into the process rates of structurally simpler macro-kinetic models coupled with gene expression. These surrogates, informed by flux balance analysis, link the domains of manipulatable intracellular enzymes to metabolic exchange fluxes. This ensures that critical knowledge captured by the system's metabolic network is preserved. The resulting models can be integrated into metabolic cybergenetic schemes involving single-level optimizations. Additionally, the hybrid modeling approach maintains the number of system states at a necessary minimum, easing the burden of process monitoring and estimation.

{"title": "Beyond Subspace Isolation: Many-to-Many Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution", "abstract": "The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.", "authors": "Zeke Zexi Hu, Xiaoming Chen, Vera Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen", "date": "1 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Nonasymptotic Regret Analysis of Adaptive Linear Quadratic Control with Model Misspecification", "abstract": "The strategy of pre-training a large model on a diverse dataset, then fine-tuning for a particular application has yielded impressive results in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic control. This strategy has vast potential in adaptive control, where it is necessary to rapidly adapt to changing conditions with limited data. Toward concretely understanding the benefit of pre-training for adaptive control, we study the adaptive linear quadratic control problem in the setting where the learner has prior knowledge of a collection of basis matrices for the dynamics. This basis is misspecified in the sense that it cannot perfectly represent the dynamics of the underlying data generating process. We propose an algorithm that uses this prior knowledge, and prove upper bounds on the expected regret after $T$ interactions with the system. In the regime where $T$ is small, the upper bounds are dominated by a term scales with either $\\texttt{poly}(\\log T)$ or $\\sqrt{T}$, depending on the prior knowledge available to the learner. When $T$ is large, the regret is dominated by a term that grows with $\\delta T$, where $\\delta$ quantifies the level of misspecification. This linear term arises due to the inability to perfectly estimate the underlying dynamics using the misspecified basis, and is therefore unavoidable unless the basis matrices are also adapted online. However, it only dominates for large $T$, after the sublinear terms arising due to the error in estimating the weights for the basis matrices become negligible. We provide simulations that validate our analysis. Our simulations also show that offline data from a collection of related systems can be used as part of a pre-training stage to estimate a misspecified dynamics basis, which is in turn used by our adaptive controller.", "authors": "Bruce D.

Instead of a single A exciton peak, vanadium-doped samples exhibit two photoluminescence peaks associated with transitions to occupied and unoccupied bands. Moreover, resonant Raman spectroscopy and resonant second-harmonic generation measurements revealed a blueshift in the B exciton but no energy change in the C exciton as vanadium is introduced in the monolayers. Density functional theory calculations showed that the band structure is sensitive to the Hubbard \\(U\\) correction for vanadium and several scenarios are proposed to explain the two photoluminescence peaks around the A exciton energy region.

Hence, their convergence suggests a remarkable robustness of the aforementioned scaling picture.

This suggests that, in terms of connectivity decay length, the Hopfield brain functions in a sort of intermediate \"turbulent liquid\"-like state, whose essential connections are the intermediate ones between the connectivity decay length and the global brain size.

We suggest a collective policy agenda - involving developers, deployers and users of AI, infrastructure providers, policymakers, and those involved in workforce training - that may help both realize and harness AI's economic potential and address its risks to our shared prosperity.", "authors": "Guy Ben-Ishai, Jeff Dean, James Manyika, Ruth Porat, Hal Varian, Kent Walker", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Conductivity scaling and absence of localization in disordered nodal line semimetals", "abstract": "Transport plays a key role in characterizing topological insulators and semimetals. Understanding the effect of disorder is crucial to assess the robustness of experimental signatures for topology. In this work, we find the absence of localization in nodal line semimetals for long-range scalar disorder and a large range of disorder strengths. Using a continuum transfer matrix approach, we find that the conductivity in the plane and out of the plane of the nodal line increases with system size and disorder strength. We substantiate these findings by a perturbative calculation and show that the conductivity increases with disorder strength using the Kubo formula in the self-consistent Born approximation. We also find that the system remains metallic for vector disorder and that vector disorder can drive a transition from an insulating to a metallic regime. Our results demonstrate the absence of localization in a bulk system.", "authors": "Carolina Paiva, Jan Behrends", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Finite Temperature Dynamics in 0-Flux and $π$-Flux Quantum Spin Ice: Self-Consistent Exclusive Boson Approach", "abstract": "Quantum spin ice (QSI) is an emblematic three-dimensional $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) on the pyrochlore lattice that hosts gapless photon-like modes and spinon excitations. Despite its notable status and the current rise of strong material candidates Ce$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf)$_2$O$_7$, there are still only a few analytical approaches to model the low-energy behavior of QSI. These analytical methods are essential to gain insight into the physical interpretation of measurements. We here introduce the self-consistent exclusive boson representation (SCEBR) to model emergent spinon excitations in QSI. By treating the presence of other emergent charges in an average way, the SCEBR extends the range of validity of the exclusive boson representation previously introduced by Hao, Day, and Gingras [Hao, Day, and Gingras, Physical Review B, 90, 214430 (2014)] to numerous cases of physical relevance. We extensively benchmark the approach and provide detailed analytical expressions for the spinon dispersion, the Bogoliubov transformation that diagonalizes the system, and the dynamical spin structure factor for 0- and $\\pi$-flux QSI. Finite temperature properties are further investigated to highlight essential differences between the thermodynamic behavior of the 0- and $\\pi$-flux phases. We notably show that the SCEBR predicts a reduction of the spinon bandwidth with increasing temperature, consistent with previous quantum Monte-Carlo results, through suppression of spinon hopping by thermal occupation. The SCEBR thus provides a powerful analytical tool to interpret experiments on current and future candidate material that has several advantages over other widely used methods.", "authors": "Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Dislocation loops by implanting boron into silicon and annealing represents an enticing strategy to transform highly inefficient silicon into a luminescent material. However, the emission at telecommunication wavelength suffers from the strong thermal quenching effect, resulting in low efficiency at room temperature. Here, we applied a new deep cooling process to address this issue. Interestingly, we find that electrons and holes recombine through defects emitting two photons, one in near infrared (NIR, 1.3~1.6 {\\mu}m) and the other in mid-infrared band (MIR, around 3.5 {\\mu}m). The PL intensity at NIR increases by three folds when the temperature increases from 77 K to 300K. Furthermore, the NIR light emission of reverse biased silicon diodes was significantly enhanced compared to forward bias, emitting the maximum output power of 42 nW at 60 mA.

We derive general bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting fermionic systems with and without disorder. We show, in particular, that in a localized system the norm does grow at most exponentially and that the contributions of operators to the total norm are exponentially suppressed with their length. We support our general results by considering one specific example, the XXZ chain with random magnetic fields. We solve the operator spreading in the XX case without disorder exactly. For the Anderson and Aubry-André models we provide strict upper bounds. We support our results by symbolic calculations of the commutator up to high orders. For the XXX case with random magnetic fields, these symbolic calculations show a growth of the operator norm faster than exponential and consistent with the general bound for a non-localized system. Also, there is no exponential decay of the contribution of operators as function of their length. We conclude that there is no indication for a many-body localization transition. Finally, we also discuss the differences between the interacting and non-interacting cases when trying to transform the microscopic to an effective Hamiltonian of local conserved charges by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. We find that such an approach is not well-defined in the interacting case because the transformation generates $\\sim 4^\\ell$ terms connecting sites a distance $\\ell$ apart which can overwhelm the exponential decay with $\\ell$ of the amplitude of each individual term.", "authors": "A.

Such stochasticity is desired for text-to-image generation tasks but problematic for SR tasks, where the image contents are expected to be well preserved. To improve the stability of diffusion prior-based SR, we propose to employ the diffusion models to refine image structures, while employing the generative adversarial training to enhance image fine details. Specifically, we propose a non-uniform timestep learning strategy to train a compact diffusion network, which has high efficiency and stability to reproduce the image main structures, and finetune the pre-trained decoder of variational auto-encoder (VAE) by adversarial training for detail enhancement.

{"title": "Colossal Layer Nernst Effect in Twisted Moiré Layers", "abstract": "Intriguing Nernst effects offer the prospect of engineering micro- and nano-sized thermoelectric devices, facilitating heat harvesting, energy conversion, and directional temperature control. In this Letter, we establish a theoretical analysis of the layer Nernst effect (LNE) in twisted moiré layers subjected to a temperature gradient. Our analysis reveals the emergence of a layer-contrasted Nernst voltage perpendicular to the direction of the temperature gradient. This phenomenon arises from the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface and the layer pseudomagnetic field. The Fermi surface's trigonal warping, breaking intra-valley inversion symmetry, leads to an imbalance between left and right movers, resulting in a non-vanishing LNE. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Importantly, our findings indicate that the Nernst coefficient in TBG can reach values as high as $\\mu$A/K, surpassing those of previously known materials by three orders of magnitude. These results provide a foundation for utilizing TBG and other twisted moiré layers as promising platforms to explore layer caloritronics and develop thermoelectric devices.", "authors": "Jin-Xin Hu, Chuanchang Zeng, Yugui Yao", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

We model the system as a Kuramoto chain of oscillators with coupling constant $k$ and noisy driving. The precision $p$ is a Fano-factor-like observable which obeys the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR), that is an upper bound related to dissipation. We first consider independent motor noises with diffusivity $D$: in this case the precision goes as $k/D$, coherently with the behavior of spatial order. The minimum observed precision is that of the uncoupled oscillator $p_{unc}$, the maximum observed one is $Np_{unc}$, saturating the TUR bound. Then we consider driving noises which are spatially correlated, as it may happen in the presence of some direct coupling between adjacent motors. Such a spatial correlation in the noise does not reduce evidently the degree of spatial correlation in the chain, but sensibly reduces the maximum attainable precision $p$, coherently with experimental observations. The limiting behaviors of the precision, in the two opposite cases of negligible interaction and strong interaction, are well reproduced by the precision of the single chain site $p_{unc}$ and the precision of the center of mass of the chain $N_{eff} p_{unc}$ with $N_{eff}<N$: both do not depend on the degree of interaction in the chain, but $N_{eff}$ decreases with the correlation length of the motor noises.", "authors": "Giulio Costantini, Andrea Puglisi", "date": "18 Jan 2024"},

Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in \\cite{chenhott} are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms.

Our main theorem, the counter-monotonic improvement theorem, states that for a given set of random variables that are either all bounded from below or all bounded from above, one can always find a set of counter-monotonic random variables such that each component is greater or equal than its counterpart in the convex order. We show that Pareto optimal allocations, if they exist, must be jackpot allocations when all agents are risk seeking.

We developed an econometric model of the determinants of passenger satisfaction in a survey conducted at the largest airport in Latin America, São Paulo GRU Airport. Our focus was on the role of flight delays in the perception of quality. The results of this study confirm the existence of a relationship between flight delays and the global satisfaction of passengers with airports. In addition, favorable evaluations regarding airports' food/beverage concessions and Wi-Fi services, but not their retail options, have a relevant moderating effect on that relationship. Furthermore, dissatisfaction arising from passengers' interaction with the airline can have negative spillover effects on their satisfaction with the airport. We also found evidence of blame-attribution behavior, in which only delays of internal origin, such as failures in flight management, are significant, indicating that passengers overlook weather-related flight delays. Finally, the results suggest that an empirical specification that does not consider the latent psychosituational traits of passengers produces a relevant overestimation of the absolute effect of flight delays on passenger satisfaction.", "authors": "Alessandro V.

It can be stated that there is no longer a way back to producing environmentally harmful products, and gradually, governmental pressures, competition, and changing customer attitudes are obliging companies to adopt and implement a green marketing approach. Over time, concepts such as green marketing have penetrated marketing literature, making environmental considerations one of the most important activities of companies. For this purpose, this research examines the effects of green marketing strategy on brand loyalty (case study: food exporting companies). The population of this study consists of 345 employees and managers of companies like Kalleh, Solico, Pemina, Sorben, Mac, Pol, and Casel, out of which 182 were randomly selected as a sample using Cochran's formula. This research is practical; the required data were collected through a survey and questionnaire. The research results indicate that (1) green marketing strategy significantly affects brand loyalty.

{"title": "Female Entrepreneur on Board:Assessing the Effect of Gender on Corporate Financial Constraints", "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of female leadership on the financial constraints of firms, which are publicly listed entrepreneurial enterprises in China. Utilizing data from 938 companies on the China Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) over a period of 2013-2022, this paper explores how the female presence in CEO positions, senior management, and board membership influences a firm's ability to manage financial constraints. Our analysis employs the Kaplan-Zingales (KZ) Index to measure these constraints, encompassing some key financial factors such as cash flow, dividends, and leverage. The findings reveal that companies with female CEOs or a higher proportion of women in top management are associated with reduced financial constraints. However, the influence of female board members is less clear-cut. Our study also delves into the variances of these effects between high-tech and low-tech industry sectors, emphasizing how internal gender biases in high-tech industries may impede the alleviation of financing constraints on firms. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the role of gender dynamics in corporate financial management, especially in the context of China's evolving economic landscape. It underscores the importance of promoting female leadership not only for gender equity but also for enhancing corporate financial resilience.", "authors": "Ruiying Xiao", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},

This study traces historical and projected changes in global food systems toward alignment with the new Healthy Diet Basket (HDB) used by UN agencies and the World Bank to monitor the cost and affordability of healthy diets worldwide. We use HDB as a standard to measure adequacy of national, regional and global supply-demand balances, finding substantial but inconsistent progress toward closer alignment with dietary guidelines, with large global shortfalls in fruits, vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and seeds, and large disparities among regions in use of animal source foods. Projections show that additional investments in the supply of agricultural products would modestly accelerate improvements in adequacy where shortfalls are greatest, revealing the need for complementary investments to increase purchasing power and demand for under-consumed food groups especially in low-income countries.", "authors": "Leah Costlow, Anna Herforth, Timothy B.

Cities are essential for defining global emissions, influencing warming levels and associated damages. High exposure and concurrent socioenvironmental problems exacerbate climate change risks in cities.

Urban SCC dominates, with both urban exposure and the UHI contributing significantly.

{"title": "Efficient Computation of Confidence Sets Using Classification on Equidistributed Grids", "abstract": "Economic models produce moment inequalities, which can be used to form tests of the true parameters. Confidence sets (CS) of the true parameters are derived by inverting these tests. However, they often lack analytical expressions, necessitating a grid search to obtain the CS numerically by retaining the grid points that pass the test. When the statistic is not asymptotically pivotal, constructing the critical value for each grid point in the parameter space adds to the computational burden. In this paper, we convert the computational issue into a classification problem by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Its decision function provides a faster and more systematic way of dividing the parameter space into two regions: inside vs. outside of the confidence set. We label those points in the CS as 1 and those outside as -1. Researchers can train the SVM classifier on a grid of manageable size and use it to determine whether points on denser grids are in the CS or not. We establish certain conditions for the grid so that there is a tuning that allows us to asymptotically reproduce the test in the CS. This means that in the limit, a point is classified as belonging to the confidence set if and only if it is labeled as 1 by the SVM.", "authors": "Lujie Zhou", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

We provide characterizations for distributional parallel trends, a concept central to our approach, within a general threshold-crossing model framework. In cases where outcomes are assumed to be reported correctly, we propose a framework for identifying and estimating treatment effects across the entire distribution. This framework is then extended to modeling underreported outcomes, allowing the reporting decision to depend on treatment status. A simulation study documents the finite sample performance of the estimators.

Using a novel dataset covering regional SLR and economic growth from 1900 to 2020, we quantify the relationships between SLR and regional GDP per capita across 79 coastal EU & UK regions. Our results reveal that the current SLR has already negatively influenced GDP of coastal regions, leading to a cumulative 4.7% loss at 39 cm of SLR. Over the 120 year period studied, the actualised impact of SLR on the annual growth rate is between -0.02% and 0.04%. Extrapolating these findings to future climate and socio-economic scenarios, we show that in the absence of additional adaptation measures, GDP losses by 2100 could range between -6.3% and -20.8% under the most extreme SLR scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5 High-end Ice, or -4.0% to -14.1% in SSP5-RCP8.5 High Ice). This statistical analysis utilising a century-long dataset, provides an empirical foundation for designing region-specific climate adaptation strategies to mitigate economic damages caused by SLR.

{"title": "Minimalist Market Design: A Framework for Economists with Policy Aspirations", "abstract": "Earlier in my career, prevalent approaches in the emerging field of market design largely represented the experiences and perspectives of leaders who were commissioned to design or reform various institutions. Since being commissioned for a similar task seemed unlikely for me as an aspiring design economist, I developed my own minimalist approach to market design. Using the policy objectives of stakeholders, my approach creates a new institution from the existing one with minimal interference with its elements that compromise the objectives. Minimalist market design initially evolved through my integrated research and policy efforts in school choice from 1997 to 2005 and in kidney exchange from 2003 to 2007. Given its success in school choice and kidney exchange, I systematically followed this approach in many other, often unusual real-world settings. In recent years, my efforts in minimalist market design led to the 2021 reform of the US Army's branching system for its cadets to military specialties, the adoption of reserve systems during the Covid-19 pandemic for vaccine allocation in 15 states and therapies in 2 states, and the deployment of a highly efficient liver exchange system in Türkiye. This same methodology also predicted the rescission of a 1995 Supreme Court judgment in India, resulting in countless litigations and interruptions of public recruitment for 25 years, as well as the mandates of its replacement. In this monograph, I describe the philosophy, evolution, and successful applications of minimalist market design, contrasting it with the mainstream paradigm for the field. In doing so, I also provide a paradigm for economists who want to influence policy and change institutions through their research.", "authors": "Tayfun Sönmez", "date": "30 Dec 2023"},

The findings show that there is a moderate association between decreased costs of starting a business and growth of FDI. Mauritius, South Africa and the DRC reduced their total cost of starting a business by 71.7%, 143.7% and 122.9% for the entire period, and saw inward FDI increases of 167.6%, 79.8% and 152.21%, respectively.

{"title": "Forecasting CPI inflation under economic policy and geo-political uncertainties", "abstract": "Forecasting a key macroeconomic variable, consumer price index (CPI) inflation, for BRIC countries using economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk is a difficult proposition for policymakers at the central banks. This study proposes a novel filtered ensemble wavelet neural network (FEWNet) that can produce reliable long-term forecasts for CPI inflation. The proposal applies a maximum overlapping discrete wavelet transform to the CPI inflation series to obtain high-frequency and low-frequency signals. All the wavelet-transformed series and filtered exogenous variables are fed into downstream autoregressive neural networks to make the final ensemble forecast. Theoretically, we show that FEWNet reduces the empirical risk compared to single, fully connected neural networks. We also demonstrate that the rolling-window real-time forecasts obtained from the proposed algorithm are significantly more accurate than benchmark forecasting methods. Additionally, we use conformal prediction intervals to quantify the uncertainty associated with the forecasts generated by the proposed approach. The excellent performance of FEWNet can be attributed to its capacity to effectively capture non-linearities and long-range dependencies in the data through its adaptable architecture.", "authors": "Shovon Sengupta, Tanujit Chakraborty, Sunny Kumar Singh", "date": "30 Dec 2023"},

{"title": "Discrete differential geometry-based model for nonlinear analysis of axisymmetric shells", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel one-dimensional (1D) discrete differential geometry (DDG)-based numerical method for geometrically nonlinear mechanics analysis (e.g., buckling and snapping) of axisymmetric shell structures. Our numerical model leverages differential geometry principles to accurately capture the complex nonlinear deformation patterns exhibited by axisymmetric shells. By discretizing the axisymmetric shell into interconnected 1D elements along the meridional direction, the in-plane stretching and out-of-bending potentials are formulated based on the geometric principles of 1D nodes and edges under the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis, and elastic force vector and associated Hession matrix required by equations of motion are later derived based on symbolic calculation. Through extensive validation with available theoretical solutions and finite element method (FEM) simulations in literature, our model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the nonlinear behavior of axisymmetric shells. Importantly, compared to the classical theoretical model and three-dimensional (3D) FEM simulation, our model is highly computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale real-time simulations of nonlinear problems of shell structures such as instability and snap-through phenomena. Moreover, our framework can easily incorporate complex loading conditions, e.g., boundary nonlinear contact and multi-physics actuation, which play an essential role in the use of engineering applications, such as soft robots and flexible devices. This study demonstrates that the simplicity and effectiveness of the 1D discrete differential geometry-based approach render it a powerful tool for engineers and researchers interested in nonlinear mechanics analysis of axisymmetric shells, with potential applications in various engineering fields.", "authors": "Weicheng Huang, Tianzhen Liu, Zhaowei Liu, Peifei Xu, Mingchao Liu, Yuzhen Chen, K.

In an adaptive experiment, a decision maker draws one of multiple treatment arms based on past observations and observes the outcome of the drawn arm.

We evaluate the decision based on the expected simple regret, which is the difference between the expected outcomes of the best arm and the recommended arm. Due to inherent uncertainty, we evaluate the regret using the minimax criterion. First, we derive asymptotic lower bounds for the worst-case expected simple regret, which are characterized by the variances of potential outcomes (leading factor). Based on the lower bounds, we propose the Two-Stage (TS)-Hirano-Imbens-Ridder (HIR) strategy, which utilizes the HIR estimator (Hirano et al., 2003) in recommending the best arm. Our theoretical analysis shows that the TS-HIR strategy is asymptotically minimax optimal, meaning that the leading factor of its worst-case expected simple regret matches our derived worst-case lower bound.

{"title": "Classification and Treatment Learning with Constraints via Composite Heaviside Optimization: a Progressive MIP Method", "abstract": "This paper proposes a Heaviside composite optimization approach and presents a progressive (mixed) integer programming (PIP) method for solving multi-class classification and multi-action treatment problems with constraints. A Heaviside composite function is a composite of a Heaviside function (i.e., the indicator function of either the open $( \\, 0,\\infty )$ or closed $[ \\, 0,\\infty \\, )$ interval) with a possibly nondifferentiable function. Modeling-wise, we show how Heaviside composite optimization provides a unified formulation for learning the optimal multi-class classification and multi-action treatment rules, subject to rule-dependent constraints stipulating a variety of domain restrictions. A Heaviside composite function has an equivalent discrete formulation, and the resulting optimization problem can in principle be solved by integer programming (IP) methods. Nevertheless, for constrained learning problems with large data sets, a straightforward application of off-the-shelf IP solvers is usually ineffective in achieving global optimality. To alleviate such a computational burden, our major contribution is the proposal of the PIP method by leveraging the effectiveness of state-of-the-art IP solvers for problems of modest sizes. We provide the theoretical advantage of the PIP method with the connection to continuous optimization and show that the computed solution is locally optimal for a broad class of Heaviside composite optimization problems.

Most of the existing literature on platform recommendation algorithms largely focuses on user preferences and decisions, and does not simultaneously address creator incentives. We propose a model of content recommendation that explicitly focuses on the dynamics of user-content matching, with the novel property that both users and creators may leave the platform permanently if they do not experience sufficient engagement. In our model, each player decides to participate at each time step based on utilities derived from the current match: users based on alignment of the recommended content with their preferences, and creators based on their audience size. We show that a user-centric greedy algorithm that does not consider creator departures can result in arbitrarily poor total engagement, relative to an algorithm that maximizes total engagement while accounting for two-sided departures. Moreover, in stark contrast to the case where only users or only creators leave the platform, we prove that with two-sided departures, approximating maximum total engagement within any constant factor is NP-hard. We present two practical algorithms, one with performance guarantees under mild assumptions on user preferences, and another that tends to outperform algorithms that ignore two-sided departures in practice.", "authors": "Daniel Huttenlocher, Hannah Li, Liang Lyu, Asuman Ozdaglar, James Siderius", "date": "30 Dec 2023 ("},

{"title": "The inherent goodness of well educated intelligence", "abstract": "This paper will examine what makes a being intelligent, whether that be a biological being or an artificial silicon being on a computer. Special attention will be paid to the being having the ability to characterize and control a collective system of many identical conservative sub-systems conservatively interacting. The essence of intelligence will be found to be the golden rule -- \"the collective acts as one\" or \"knowing the global consequences of local actions\". The flow of the collective is a small set of twinkling textures, that are governed by a puppeteer who is pulling a small number of strings according to a geodesic motion of least action, determined by the symmetries. Controlling collective conservative systems is difficult and has historically been done by adding significant viscosity to the system to stabilize the desirable meta stable equilibriums of maximum performance, but it degrades or destroys them in the process. There is an alternative. Once the optimum twinkling textures of the meta stable equilibriums are identified by the intelligent being (that is the collective system is characterized), the collective system can be moved by the intelligent being to the optimum twinkling textures, then quickly vibrated by the intelligent being according to the textures so that the collective system remains at the meta stable equilibrium. Well educated intelligence knows the global consequences of its local actions so that it will not take short term actions that will lead to poor long term outcomes. In contrast, trained intelligence or trained stupidity will optimize its short term actions, leading to poor long term outcomes. Well educated intelligence is inherently good, but trained stupidity is inherently evil and should be feared.

We study whether there are significant gains from being a small or a large country in terms of certain socioeconomic indicators and how large this premium is. Using panel data for 200 countries over 50 years, we estimate premia for various sizes of nations across a variety of key economic and socioeconomic performance indicators. We find that smaller countries are richer, have larger governments, and are more prudent in terms of fiscal policies than larger ones. On the other hand, smaller countries seem to be subject to higher absolute and per capita costs for the provision of essential public goods, which may lower their socioeconomic performance in terms of health and education. In terms of economic performance, small countries seem to do better than large countries, compensating for smallness by relying on foreign trade and foreign direct investment. The latter comes at the cost of higher vulnerability to external shocks, resulting in higher volatility of growth rates.

{"title": "Effect on New Loan Repayment Fine Clause on Bank Jaya Artha's Customer Satisfaction and Recommendation", "abstract": "The growing population of older people in Indonesia--the world's fourth-most populous country--makes a larger cake for the pension business, including in the banking sector. PT Bank Jaya Artha is one of the Indonesian banks that provide products and services for people who are set to enter retirement age. In the wake of tight competition in the pension business market, Bank Jaya Artha has since 2019 imposed a fine of three times of installments in addition to 5% of outstanding debt on customers planning to repay their debt in a mission to prevent them from leaving for competitors. While the clause is not included in loan agreements signed before the implementation, it applies to past loan agreements as well. This, in turn, has led to customer complaints. The research is meant to find out how the implementation of the unconsented clause has affected customer satisfaction and willingness to recommend the bank and what the bank should do to become more customer-centric, according to customers. Using a design thinking framework, the research collects quantitative and qualitative data from the bank's pension customers through questionnaires and forum group discussions. Statistical analysis is utilized on quantitative data from questionnaires, and content analysis is utilized on qualitative data from questionnaires. A narrative analysis is also used to explain qualitative data from forum group discussions. The result shows that there are problems in the way the bank communicates information to customers, particularly information about the loan repayment fine. Lack of transparency, a reactive approach instead of a proactive one, the obscurity of the information, and the time the information is delivered have affected customers' satisfaction toward the bank.", "authors": "Mustaqim Adamrah, Yos Sunitiyoso", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "World Wine Exports: What Determines the Success of New World Wine Producers?", "abstract": "By using an econometric approach this paper looks at the evolution of the world wine industry in the period 1961-2005. A particular stylized fact is the appearance of nontraditional producing and exporting countries of wine from the beginning of the nineties. We show that the success of these new producing and exporting countries can be explained by the importance of the demand from non-producing countries with little or no tradition of wine consumption, relative to the world demand. This stylized fact is consistent with a testable implication of the switching cost literature and to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this implication is tested.", "authors": "Osiris Jorge Parcero, Emiliano Villanueva", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},

The evidence presented considers two measurements of scientific production (published articles and citations) and three levels of aggregation in the areas (a minor one with 5 large areas, a more detailed one with 27 disciplines and another even more granular with more than 300 disaggregations). Within Health Sciences there is a RCA in Veterinary, Nursing and Medicine.

{"title": "Robust Bayesian Method for Refutable Models", "abstract": "We propose a robust Bayesian method for economic models that can be rejected under some data distributions. The econometrician starts with a structural assumption which can be written as the intersection of several assumptions, and the joint assumption is refutable. To avoid the model rejection, the econometrician first takes a stance on which assumption $j$ is likely to be violated and considers a measurement of the degree of violation of this assumption $j$. She then considers a (marginal) prior belief on the degree of violation $(\\pi_{m_j})$: She considers a class of prior distributions $\\pi_s$ on all economic structures such that all $\\pi_s$ have the same marginal distribution $\\pi_m$. Compared to the standard nonparametric Bayesian method that puts a single prior on all economic structures, the robust Bayesian method imposes a single marginal prior distribution on the degree of violation. As a result, the robust Bayesian method allows the econometrician to take a stance only on the likeliness of violation of assumption $j$. Compared to the frequentist approach to relax the refutable assumption, the robust Bayesian method is transparent on the econometrician's stance of choosing models. We also show that many frequentists' ways to relax the refutable assumption can be found equivalent to particular choices of robust Bayesian prior classes. We use the local average treatment effect (LATE) in the potential outcome framework as the leading illustrating example.", "authors": "Moyu Liao", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},

The core contribution of this research is the illumination of five interdependent but interrelated orchestration practices: strategic design, relational, resource integration, technological, and innovation. Together, these practices are synthesized into an integrative framework termed the \"Stirring Model,\" which serves as a practical guide to the orchestration practices. Furthermore, the conceptual framework clarifies the synergy between the identified practices and highlights their collective impact.

Under a dynamic network we understand a network with a fixed vertex set and an edge set which changes randomly over time. We will assume that the spatial dependence-structure of the processes conditional on the network behaves in the following way: Close vertices (or pairs of vertices) are dependent, while we assume that the dependence decreases conditionally on that the distance in the network increases. We make this intuition mathematically precise by considering three concepts based on correlation, beta-mixing with time-varying beta-coefficients and conditional independence. These concepts allow proving weak-dependence results, e.g. an exponential inequality, which might be of independent interest. In order to demonstrate the use of these concepts in an application we study the asymptotics (for growing networks) of a goodness of fit test in a dynamic interaction network model based on a Cox-type model for counting processes. This model is then applied to bike-sharing data.", "authors": "Alexander Kreiss", "date": "7 Jun 2019 ("},
{"title": "Economic Forces in Stock Returns", "abstract": "When analyzing the components influencing the stock prices, it is commonly believed that economic activities play an important role. More specifically, asset prices are more sensitive to the systematic economic news that impose a pervasive effect on the whole market. Moreover, the investors will not be rewarded for bearing idiosyncratic risks as such risks are diversifiable. In the paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an attribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces influencing the market. They first defined and examined five classic factors from previous research papers: Industrial Production, Unanticipated Inflation, Change in Expected Inflation, Risk Premia, and The Term Structure. By adding in new factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they examined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The paper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic news, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the significant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by such motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general framework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic factors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.", "authors": "Yue Chen, Mohan Li", "date": "6 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Anonymous and Strategy-Proof Voting under Subjective Expected Utility Preferences", "abstract": "We study three axioms in the model of constrained social choice under uncertainty where (i) agents have subjective expected utility preferences over acts and (ii) different states of nature have (possibly) different sets of available outcomes. Anonymity says that agents' names or labels should never play a role in the mechanism used to select the social act. Strategy-proofness requires that reporting one's true preferences be a (weakly) dominant strategy for each agent in the associated direct revelation game. Range unanimity essentially says that a feasible act must be selected by society whenever it is reported as every voter's favorite act within the range of the mechanism. We first show that every social choice function satisfying these three axioms can be factored as a product of voting rules that are either constant or binary (always yielding one of two pre-specified outcomes in each state). We describe four basic types of binary factors: three of these types are novel to this literature and exploit the voters' subjective beliefs. Our characterization result then states that a social choice function is anonymous, strategy-proof and range-unanimous if and only if every binary factor (in its canonical factorization) is of one of these four basic types.", "authors": "Eric Bahel", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

Simply relying on aggregate measures or summary statistics, such as the impact of average country temperature changes on HICP headline inflation, conceals a large heterogeneity across (sub-)sectors of the economy. Additionally, the impact of a weather anomaly on consumer prices depends not only on its sign and magnitude, but also on its location and the size of the area affected by the shock. This is especially true for larger countries or regions with diverse climate zones, since the geographical distribution of climatic effects plays a role in shaping economic outcomes. Using time series data of geolocations, we demonstrate that relying solely on country averages fails to adequately capture and explain the influence of weather on consumer prices in the euro area. We conclude that the information content hidden in rich and complex surface data can provide valuable insights into the role of weather and climate variables for price stability, and more generally may help to inform economic policy.", "authors": "Paulo M.

This result has two major implications. First, it is possible to measure a respondent's ideal answer to a survey using only ordinal relations between possible answers.

At the same time, there is some tentative evidence suggesting that oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality, which can potentially influence the estimated empirical relationships between oil richness and income inequality. In this paper we contribute to the literature in a twofold manner. First, we explore in depth the empirical relationship between oil and income inequality by making use of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database; the most comprehensive dataset on income inequality providing comparable data for the broadest set of country-year observations. Second, this is the first study to our knowledge that adopts an empirical framework to examine whether oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality and the possible implications thereof. We make use of Heckman selection models to validate the tendency of oil rich countries to under-report and correct for the bias that might arise as a result of this; we find that oil is associated with lower income inequality with the exception of the very oil-rich economies.", "authors": "Osiris Jorge Parcero, Elissaios Papyrakis", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

To achieve identification we complement one excluded but possibly endogenous quasi-IV (e.g., ``relevant proxies'' such as previous treatment choice) with one exogenous (conditional on the excluded quasi-IV) but possibly included quasi-IV (e.g., random assignment or exogenous market shocks). In practice, our identification strategy should be attractive since complementary quasi-IVs should be easier to find than standard IVs. Our approach also holds if any of the two quasi-IVs turns out to be a valid IV.", "authors": "Christophe Bruneel-Zupanc, Jad Beyhum", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

The latter, however, are not clearly associated to a chaotic phase space, and the connection between the single- and many-body notions of quantum scars remains therefore incomplete. Here, we find the first quantum many-body scars originating from UPOs of a chaotic phase space. Remarkably, these states verify the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and we thus refer to them as thermal quantum many-body scars. While they do not preclude thermalization, their spectral structure featuring approximately equispaced towers of states yields an anomalous oscillatory dynamics preceding thermalization for wavepackets initialized on an UPO. Remarkably, our model hosts both types of scars, thermal and nonthermal, and allows to study the crossover between the two.

Here, we derive a semiclassical theory to thermal emission from time-varying media based on fluctuational electrodynamics, and compare it to the quantum theory. Our results show that a quantum theory is needed to correctly capture the contribution from quantum vacuum amplifications effects, which can be relevant even at room temperature and mid-infrared frequencies.

{"title": "Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products", "abstract": "Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.", "authors": "Shengjie Luo, Tianlang Chen, Aditi S.

The nonlinear system is solved numerically, revealing that the results are consistent with the linear predictions in the case of repulsive inter-component interactions. On the other hand, inter-component attraction creates the GS in the form of mixed-mode states in a vicinity of the GS phase-transition points.

Through the previous studies of various mixed halide double perovskite materials as potential absorber layer materials, it has been observed that Cs$_2$TiI$_{6-x}$Br$_x$ possesses promising characteristics.

In their regimes with real spectra, within this family of similarity transformations, there is a map from the non-Hermitian theory to its Hermitian similarity partner. We promote the similarity transformation to a local symmetry, which requires the introduction of a new vector similarity field as a connection in the similarity space of non-Hermitian theories. In the case of non-Hermitian two-flavour scalar or fermion mixing, and by virtue of a novel IR/UV mixing effect, the effect of inhomogeneous non-Hermiticity then reveals itself via anomalous dispersion, instabilities and superluminal group velocities at very high momenta, thus setting an upper bound on the particle momentum propagating through inhomogeneous backgrounds characterised by Lagrangians with non-Hermitian mass matrices.

{"title": "Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph Neural Networks", "abstract": "Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used disordered materials. Understanding the relationship between the local structure and physical properties of MGs is one of the greatest challenges for both material science and condensed matter physics. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the atomic graph structure and study the connection between the structure and the corresponding local energy barrier, which is believed to govern many critical physical properties in MGs. One of our key contributions is to propose a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model for predicting the energy barriers, which is invariant under orthogonal transformations of the structure, e.g., rotations and reflections. Such invariance is a desired property that standard GNNs like Graph Convolutional Networks cannot capture. SymGNNs handle the invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure for representation learning, and an optimal distribution over all 3D orthogonal transformations $\\mathcal{O}_3$ is learned to maximize the benefit of invariance. We demonstrate in our experiments that SymGNN can significantly improve the energy barrier prediction over other GNNs and non-graph machine learning models. With such an accurate model, we also apply graph explanation algorithms to better reveal the structure-property relationship of MGs.

We study eigenstates which are characterised by cyclic supercurrents per each triangular plaquette (\"loop\" states). For noninteracting systems we find at least three classes of loop eigenmodes: standard; chaotic and periodic. Standard modes are those inherited from the basic three-site ring of condensates with phase differences locked to $2\\pi/3$. Standard modes become unstable in the interacting system but only when interaction exceeds a certain critical value $u_c$. Chaotic modes are characterised by very different circular currents per plaquette, so that the usual symmetry of loop currents is broken. Circular supercurrents associated with chaotic modes become chaotic for any finite interaction, signalling the loss of coherence between the condensates. Periodic modes are described by alternating populations and two different phase differences. The modes are self-similar and are present in all generations of Sierpinskii gasket. When interaction is included, circular current of such a mode becomes periodic in time with the amplitude growing linearly with interaction. Above a critical interaction the amplitude saturates signalling a transition to a macroscopic self-trapping state originally known from a usual Bose Josephson junction.

To evaluate the gate error, we used the Magnus expansion introducing generalized filter functions that describe decoupling while processing and allow us to derive an approximate analytic expression as a hierarchy of nested integrals of noise cumulants. The error is separated in contributions of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, the corresponding generalized filter functions being calculated up to the fourth order. By exploiting the properties of selected pulse sequences, we show that it is possible to extract the second-order statistics (spectrum and cross-spectrum) and to highlight non-Gaussian features contained in the fourth-order cumulant.

As the wetting transitions ensue, the gas diffuses into the water leading to the fully-water-filled state. However, the standard models for wetting do not account for the microtexture's topography. In other words, it is not clear whether the lifetime of n cavities arranged in a I-D line or a II-D (circular or square) lattice would be the same or not as a single 0-D cavity. In response, we tracked the time-dependent fates of gas pockets trapped in I-D and II-D lattices and compared them with wetting transitions in commensurate 0-D cavities. Interestingly, the wetting transitions in the I-D and the II-D arrays had a directionality such that the gas from the outermost cavities was lost the first, while the innermost got filled by water the last. In essence, microtexture's spatial organization afforded shielding to the loss of the gas from the innermost cavities, which we probed as a function of the microtexture's pitch, surface density, dimensionality, and hydrostatic pressure.

{"title": "Ultrafast evanescent heat transfer across solid interfaces via hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride", "abstract": "The efficiency of phonon-mediated heat transport is limited by the intrinsic atomistic properties of materials, seemingly providing an upper limit to heat transfer in materials and across their interfaces. The typical speeds of conductive transport, which are inherently limited by the chemical bonds and atomic masses, dictate how quickly heat will move in solids. Given that phonon-polaritons, or coupled phonon-photon modes, can propagate at speeds approaching 1 percent of the speed of light - orders of magnitude faster than transport within a pure diffusive phonon conductor - we demonstrate that volume-confined, hyperbolic phonon-polariton(HPhP) modes supported by many biaxial polar crystals can couple energy across solid-solid interfaces at an order of magnitude higher rates than phonon-phonon conduction alone. Using pump-probe thermoreflectance with a mid-infrared, tunable, probe pulse with sub-picosecond resolution, we demonstrate remote and spectrally selective excitation of the HPhP modes in hexagonal boron nitride in response to radiative heating from a thermally emitting gold source. Our work demonstrates a new avenue for interfacial heat transfer based on broadband radiative coupling from a hot spot in a gold film to hBN HPhPs, independent of the broad spectral mismatch between the pump(visible) and probe(mid-IR) pulses employed. This methodology can be used to bypass the intrinsically limiting phonon-phonon conductive pathway, thus providing an alternative means of heat transfer across interfaces. Further, our time-resolved measurements of the temperature changes of the HPhP modes in hBN show that through polaritonic coupling, a material can transfer heat across and away from an interface at rates orders of magnitude faster than diffusive phonon speeds intrinsic to the material, thus demonstrating a pronounced thermal transport enhancement in hBN via phonon-polariton coupling.", "authors": "William Hutchins, John A.

Although the TDE is about $2.6^\\circ$ off the direction of the reconstructed neutrino event (${outside}$ the 90% C.L. localization region), the TDE candidate shares some important characteristics with so far reported neutrino-TDE associations: a strong infrared dust echo, high bolometric luminosity, a neutrino time delay with respect to the peak mass accretion rate of the order of hundred days, and a high observed X-ray luminosity. We interpret this new association using an isotropic emission model, where neutrinos are produced by the collision of accelerated protons with infrared photons. After accounting for the high redshift of AT2021lwx (by interpreting the data in the SMBH frame), we find that the expected neutrino fluences and neutrino time delays are qualitatively comparable to the other TDEs.

We demonstrate that such a system naturally realizes correlated hopping interactions and provides a sharp connection between such interactions and flux attachment. Starting with a simple, nearest-neighbor, free boson model, we find evidence -- from both a coupled wire analysis and large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations -- that Floquet flux attachment stabilizes the bosonic integer quantum Hall state at $1/4$ filling (on a square lattice), and the Halperin-221 fractional quantum Hall state at $1/6$ filling (on a honeycomb lattice). At $1/2$ filling on the square lattice, time-reversal symmetry is instead spontaneously broken and bosonic integer quantum Hall states with opposite Hall conductances are degenerate.

This role becomes crucial, for example, in the strong disorder limit, where the mean length of the optimal path for a fixed end-to-end distance diverges as the lattice size increases. We propose a unified scaling ansatz for the mean length of the optimal path in $D-$dimensional disordered lattices. The ansatz is supported by a comprehensive numerical study of the problem on $2D$ lattices, yet we also present results in $D=3$.

Unlike traditional methods, this model does not possess a fundamental graph network architecture but utilizes the Transformer architecture to extract latent atomic features. This allows the CrystalTransformer to mitigate the inherent topological information bias of graph neural networks while maximally preserving the atomic chemical information, making it more accurate in encoding complex atomic features and thereby offering a deeper understanding of the atoms in materials.

Here we report that a circularly polarised light not only opens up a topological gap at the $\\Gamma$-point but also lifts the valley degeneracy at that point. Endowed with Floquet dynamics and by devising a scheme of high-frequency approximation, we have proposed that the handedness (left/right) in polarised light offers the possibility to realise the valley-selective circular dichroism in Kek-Y shaped graphene superlattice. Also, the non-vanishing Berry curvature and enumeration of valley resolved Chern number $\\mathcal{C}_{K}/\\mathcal{C}_{K^\\prime}=+1/-1$ enable us to assign two pseudo-spin flavors (up/down) with the two valleys. Thereby, the above observations confirm the topological transition suggesting the ease of realising the valley quantum anomalous Hall (VQAH) state within the photon-dressed Kek-Y. These findings further manifest a non-zero optical valley polarisation which is maximum at the $\\Gamma$-point.

Those phases are for increasing power: (i) Larmor precession of pseudo-spins - a signature of continuous TC, (ii) locking of the frequency of precession to self-sustained coherent phonons - stabilized TC, (iii) doubling of TC frequency by phonons - a discrete TC with continuous excitation.

This describes large collections of self-propelled entities all spontaneously moving in the same direction, each emitting a substance which attracts the others (e.g., ants). The theory combines features of the Keller-Segel model for autochemotaxis with the Toner-Tu theory of flocking. We find that sufficiently strong autochemotaxis leads to an instability of the uniformly moving state (the ``flock\"), in which bands of different density form moving parallel to the mean flock velocity with different speeds. These bands, which are reminiscent of ant trails, coarsen over time to reach a phase-separated state, in which one high density and one low density band fill the entire system. The same instability, described by the same hydrodynamic theory, can occur in flocks phase separating due to any microscopic mechanism (e.g., sufficiently strong attractive interactions). Although in many ways analogous to equilibrium phase separation via spinodal decomposition, the two steady state densities here are determined not by a common tangent construction, as in equilibrium, but by an uncommon tangent construction very similar to that found for motility induced phase separation (MIPS) of disordered active particles.

Most studies concentrate on the interfacial thermal conductance between either crystalline-crystalline or amorphous-amorphous materials. Here, we investigate the interfacial thermal conductance at crystalline-amorphous interfaces using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, gold and two different materials, silicon and silica, in both their crystalline and amorphous structures, have been considered. The findings reveal that the interfacial thermal conductance between amorphous structures and gold is found to be $300 \\%$ higher as compared to crystalline structures for both planar and rough interfaces ($\\approx$ 152 MW/m$^2$K for gold-amorphous silicon and $\\approx$ 56 MW/m$^2$K for gold-crystalline silicon). This threefold increase could not be captured by the diffuse mismatch model, neither be explained by phonon localization at the interface.

The commonly used formulation is based on managing Maxwell's equations in exactly the same form as in Minkowski spacetime and expressing the effect of gravity as a set of constitutive relations. We show that such a set of Maxwell's equations is, in fact, a combination of the electric and magnetic fields defined in two different non-covariant ways, both of which fail to identify the associated observer's four-vectors. The suggested constitutive relations are also ad hoc and unjustified. To an observer with a proper four-vector, the effect of gravity can be arranged as effective polarizations and magnetizations appearing in both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts. Modifying the homogeneous part by gravity is inevitable to any observer, and the result cannot be interpreted as the medium property.

Measurements from the Waves instrument onboard the Juno spacecraft permitted to establish the distribution of nKOM occurrence and intensity as a function of frequency and latitude. We have developed a 3D geometrical model that can simulate at large scale the plasma emissions occurrence observed by a spacecraft based on an internal Jovian magnetic field model and a diffusive equilibrium model of the plasma density in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere. With this model, we propose a new method to discriminate the generation mechanism, wave mode, beaming and radio source location of plasma emissions. Here, this method is applied to the study of the nKOM observed from all latitudes by the Juno/Waves experiment to identify which conditions reasonably reproduce the observed occurrence distribution versus frequency and latitude. The results allow us to exclude the two main nKOM models published so far, and to show that the emission must be produced at the local plasma frequency and beamed along its local gradient in the direction of decreasing frequencies. We also propose that depending on its latitude, Juno observes two distinct kinds of nKOM: the low frequency nKOM in ordinary mode at high latitudes and high frequency nKOM on extraordinary mode at low latitudes. Both radio source locations are found to be distributed near the centrifugal equator from the outer edge to the inner edge of the Io plasma torus.", "authors": "Adam Boudouma, Philippe Zarka, Corentin Louis, Carine Briand, Masafumi Imai", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

We study the interface dynamics of strongly coupled immiscible binary superfluids by using holographic duality. The full nonlinear evolution of the binary superfluids with a relative velocity shows rich nonlinear patterns toward quantum turbulence, which is reminiscent of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The wave number of the fast growing modes $k_0$ extracted from the interface pattern yields a non-monotonic dependence of the relative velocity, independent of the temperature and interaction. The value of $k_0$ first increases with the velocity difference and then decreases, which stands in sharp contrast to the results of mean-field theory described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and is confirmed by using the linear analyses on top of the stationary configuration. We uncover that the critical velocity associated with the maximum correspond to the case when the mean separation of vortices generated by interface instabilities becomes comparable to the vortex size, which could be a universal physical mechanism at strongly interacting superfluids and is directly testable in laboratory experiments.", "authors": "Yu-Ping An, Li Li, Chuan-Yin Xia, Hua-Bi Zeng", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Here, we present a map of differently stacked graphene sheets, at arbitrary rotation angles corresponding to precise interplanar distances, into an equivalence class represented by magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We determine the equivalence relation in the class within a continuum model, and extend its definition to a tight-binding approach. Then, we use density functional theory to suggest that the magic-angle physics may be characterized by costly computational strategies on a twisted bilayer geometry, with conveniently large stacking angles.

Beside reproducing earlier results from the literature for those bulk magnets, the effect of the lattice compression is also studied for Fe bulk, and significant changes for the Gilbert damping are found. Furthermore, (001)-oriented surfaces of Fe and Co are also investigated. It is found that the on-site Gilbert damping increases in the surface atomic layer and decreases in the subsurface layer, and approaches the bulk value moving further inside the magnets. Realistic atomic relaxation of the surface layers enhances the identified effects. The first-neighbor damping parameters are extremely sensitive to the surface relaxation.

{"title": "Search for interacting galaxy clusters from SDSS DR-17 employing optimized friend-of-friend algorithm and multi-messenger tracers", "abstract": "In the theoretical framework of hierarchical structure formation, galaxy clusters evolve through continuous accretion and mergers of substructures. Cosmological simulations have revealed the best picture of the Universe as a 3-D filamentary network of dark-matter distribution called the cosmic web. Galaxy clusters are found to form at the nodes of this network and are the regions of high merging activity. Such mergers being highly energetic, contain a wealth of information about the dynamical evolution of structures in the Universe. Observational validation of this scenario needs a colossal effort to identify numerous events from all-sky surveys. Therefore, such efforts are sparse in literature and tend to focus on individual systems. In this work, we present an improved search algorithm for identifying interacting galaxy clusters and have successfully produced a comprehensive list of systems from SDSS DR-17. By proposing a set of physically motivated criteria, we classified these interacting clusters into two broad classes, 'merging' and 'pre-merging/postmerging' systems. Interestingly, as predicted by simulations, we found that most cases show cluster interaction along the prominent cosmic filaments of galaxy distribution (i.e., the proxy for DM filaments), with the most violent ones at their nodes. Moreover, we traced the imprint of interactions through multi-band signatures, such as diffuse cluster emissions in radio or X-rays. Although we could not find direct evidence of diffuse emission from connecting filaments and ridges; our catalogue of interacting clusters will ease locating such faintest emissions as data from sensitive telescopes like eROSITA or SKA, becomes accessible", "authors": "Tejas Oak, Surajit Paul", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

To this end, we formulate the viscoelastic behavior in terms of the (Helmholtz) free energy potential and a dissipation potential. Assuming the availability of full-field interior kinematic data, the constitutive mismatch between the kinematic quantities (strains and internal thermodynamic variables) and their ``stress'' counterparts (Cauchy stress tensor and that of thermodynamic tensions), commonly referred to as the ECR functional, is established with the aid of Legendre-Fenchel gap functionals linking the thermodynamic potentials to their energetic conjugates. We then proceed by introducing the modified ECR (MECR) functional as a linear combination between its ECR parent and the kinematic data misfit, computed for a trial set of constitutive parameters. The affiliated stationarity conditions then yield two coupled evolution problems, namely (i) the forward evolution problem for the (trial) displacement field driven by the constitutive mismatch, and (ii) the backward evolution problem for the adjoint field driven by the data mismatch. This allows us to establish compact expressions for the MECR functional and its gradient with respect to the viscoelastic constitutive parameters. For generality, the formulation is established assuming both time-domain (i.e. transient) and frequency-domain data. We illustrate the developments in a two-dimensional setting by pursuing the multi-frequency MECR reconstruction of (i) piecewise-homogeneous standard linear solid, and (b) smoothly-varying Jeffreys viscoelastic material.", "authors": "Marc Bonnet, Prasanna Salasiya, Bojan B.

{"title": "In-plane Density Gradation of Shoe Midsoles for Optimized Cushioning Performance", "abstract": "Midsoles are important components in footwear as they provide shock absorption and stability, thereby improving comfort and effectively preventing certain foot and ankle injuries. A rationally tailored midsole can potentially mitigate plantar pressure, improving performance and comfort levels. Despite the importance of midsole design, the potential of using in-plane density gradation in midsole has been rarely explored in earlier studies. The present work investigates the effectiveness of in-plane density gradation in shoe midsoles using a new class of polyurea foams as the material candidate. Their excellent cushioning properties justify the use of polyurea foams. Different polyurea foam densities, ranging from 95 to 350 kg/m3 are examined and tested to construct density-dependent correlative mathematical relations required for the optimization process. An optimization framework is then created to allocate foam densities at certain plantar zones based on the required cushioning performance constrained by the local pressures. The interior-point algorithm was used to solve the constrained optimization problem. The optimization algorithm introduces a novel approach, utilizing the maximum specific energy absorption as the objective function. The optimization process identifies specific foam densities at various plantar regions for maximum biomechanical energy dissipation without incurring additional weight penalties. Our results suggest midsole design can benefit from horizontal (in-plane) density gradation, leading to potential weight reduction and localized cushioning improvements. With local plantar peak pressure data analysis, the optimization results indicate low-density polyurea foams (140 kg/m3) for central and lateral phalanges, whereas stiffer foams (185-230 kg/m3) are identified as suitable candidates for metatarsal and arch regions in an in-plane density graded midsole design.", "authors": "Kazi Zahir Uddin, Hai Anh Nguyen, Thanh T.

The energy spectrum under open boundary condition is composed of real and imaginary eigenenergies when the nonreciprocal hopping is weak. Interestingly, the real eigenenergies form an equally spaced ladder, and the corresponding eigenstates are localized at the boundary with a Gaussian distribution due to NHSE. By increasing the nonreciprocity, the number of real eigenenergies will decrease while more and more eigenenergies become imaginary. Accompanied by the real-imaginary transition in the spectrum, the eigenstates are shifted from the boundary into the bulk of the lattice. When the nonreciprocity gets strong enough, the whole spectrum will be imaginary and the NHSE disappears completely in the system, i.e., all the eigenstates become Gaussian bound states localized inside the bulk.

We discuss two observational scenarios in which it may be possible to place interesting constraints on such models through monitoring repeating FRB sources: 1) By sending radio receivers to space to form a baseline of tens of AU or more and measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between receivers. 2) By measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between two lensed images of one strongly lensed repeater. In both scenarios, obtaining interesting constraints requires correlating the voltage time series to measure the radio-signal arrival time to sub-nanosecond precision. We find that two radio dishes separated by $20\\,$AU may be sensitive to the enhancement of small-scale structures at $\\sim 10^{-8}M_\\odot$ masses in the QCD axion dark matter scenario or from an early epoch of matter-domination with a reheating temperature up to 60 MeV.

We further show that a strong lensing situation of multiple images provides an equivalent $\\sim 2000\\,$AU baseline, which can be much more sensitive but with the uncertainty that intervening ISM decoherence may degrade the timing precision and that spatial variation in the FRB emission spot may result in confounding signals.

We found that the dust disk model passively heated by the central protostar cannot reproduce the observed peak brightness temperature of the 1.3-mm continuum emission ($\\sim$195 K), regardless of the assumptions about the dust opacity. Our calculation suggests that viscous accretion heating in the disk is required to reproduce the observed high brightness temperature.

Our modeling reveals that such an asymmetric intensity distribution requires flaring of the dust along the disk's vertical direction with the scale-height following $h/r \\sim r^{0.3}$ as function of radius.

First, the gap-lens-assisted extractor mode reduces the field strength at the sample while mitigating image aberrations. This mode gave good results in all spectral ranges. Secondly, by compensating the field at the sample surface with a negative voltage at the ring electrode we can operate in zero-field mode, which is beneficial for operando experiments. Finally, higher negative voltages establish the repeller mode, which removes all slow electrons below a certain kinetic energy to eliminate the primary contribution to the space-charge interaction in pump-probe experiments.

{"title": "Universal Vortex Statistics and Stochastic Geometry of Bose-Einstein Condensation", "abstract": "The cooling of a Bose gas in finite time results in the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate that is spontaneously proliferated with vortices. We propose that the vortex spatial statistics is described by a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) with a density dictated by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). We validate this model using numerical simulations of the two-dimensional stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE) for both a homogeneous and a hard-wall trapped condensate. The KZM scaling of the average vortex number with the cooling rate is established along with the universal character of the vortex number distribution. The spatial statistics between vortices is characterized by analyzing the two-point defect-defect correlation function, the corresponding spacing distributions, and the random tessellation of the vortex pattern using the Voronoi cell area statistics. Combining the PPP description with the KZM, we derive universal theoretical predictions for each of these quantities and find them in agreement with the SGPE simulations. Our results establish the universal character of the spatial statistics of point-like topological defects generated during a continuous phase transition and the associated stochastic geometry.", "authors": "Mithun Thudiyangal, Adolfo del Campo", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Quantum Phase Transitions and Dynamics in Perturbed Flatbands", "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in flatband systems which exhibit macroscopic degeneracies. These systems offer a valuable mathematical framework for the extreme sensitivity to perturbations and interactions. This sensitivity unveils a wide variety of exotic and unconventional physical phenomena. Moreover, the progress in their experimental realization contributes to the expanding landscape of exploration in this field. This thesis aims to summarize all the works throughout the Ph.D. program. Firstly, an in-depth exploration was conducted on the impact of weak quasiperiodic perturbations on one-dimensional two-band all-bands-flat lattices. These tight-binding Hamiltonian are diagonalized through a sequence of local unitary transformations. By adjusting the quasiperiodic potential parameters, the key achievement involves finding a critical-to-insulator transition and identifying fractality edges in the flatband systems with quasiperiodic perturbations. Next, the investigation delved into the effects of on-site interactions among hard-core bosons in one- and two-dimensional cross-stitch lattices. One key finding is that groundstate energy primarily depends on compact localized states. Moreover, the presence of barriers of compact localized states trap bosons, leading to the emergence of non-ergodic excitation and Hilbert space fragmentation. Lastly, a compact localized eigenstate of the one-dimensional diamond chain using an electric circuit was successfully generated via local (linear and non-linear) driving. This achievement opens up a versatile circuit platform for the generation of flatbands and holds promise for potential applications in the field of quantum information. I hope these collective efforts have expanded the frontiers of the field and made a meaningful contribution to the scientific community.", "authors": "Sanghoon Lee", "date": "16 Jan 2024"},

To study its dependence on the values of cosmological parameters and physical conditions in the intergalactic medium, the evolution of the global (sky-averaged) differential brightness temperature in this line was computed in standard and non-standard cosmological models with different parameters. The standard $\\Lambda$CDM model with post-Planck parameters predicts a value of the differential brightness temperature in the center of the absorption line $\\delta T_{br}\\approx35$ mK at $z\\approx87$. The frequency of the line in the absorption maximum is 16 MHz, the effective half-width of the line is 17 MHz. The depth of line is moderately sensitive to $\\Omega_b$ and $H_0$, weakly sensitive to $\\Omega_{dm}$, and insensitive to other parameters of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. But line is very sensitive to the additional mechanisms of heating or cooling of baryonic matter during the Dark Ages, so it can be a good test of non-standard cosmological models. In the models with decaying and self-annihilating dark matter, as well as with a primordial stochastic magnetic field, the temperature of baryonic matter in this period is higher if the larger is the fraction of these energy components of dark matter and magnetic field strength. The absorption line becomes shallower, desappers and transitions to emission at values of the component parameters lower than the upper limits on them following from the current observational data.

{"title": "Parameterizing black hole orbits for adiabatic inspiral", "abstract": "Adiabatic binary inspiral in the small mass ratio limit treats the small body as moving along a geodesic of a large Kerr black hole, with the geodesic slowly evolving due to radiative backreaction. Up to initial conditions, geodesics are typically parameterized in two ways: using the integrals of motion energy $E$, axial angular momentum $L_z$, and Carter constant $Q$; or, using orbit geometry parameters semi-latus rectum $p$, eccentricity $e$, and (cosine of ) inclination $x_I \\equiv \\cos I$. The community has long known how to compute orbit integrals as functions of the orbit geometry parameters, i.e., as functions expressing $E(p, e, x_I)$, and likewise for $L_z$ and $Q$. Mappings in the other direction -- functions $p(E, L_z, Q)$, and likewise for $e$ and $x_I$ -- have not yet been developed in general. In this note, we develop generic mappings from ($E$, $L_z$, $Q$) to ($p$, $e$, $x_I$). The mappings are particularly simple for equatorial orbits ($Q = 0$, $x_I = \\pm1$), and can be evaluated efficiently for generic cases.

{"title": "Reservoir computing with logistic map", "abstract": "Recent studies on reservoir computing essentially involve a high dimensional dynamical system as the reservoir, which transforms and stores the input as a higher dimensional state, for temporal and nontemporal data processing. We demonstrate here a method to predict temporal and nontemporal tasks by constructing virtual nodes as constituting a reservoir in reservoir computing using a nonlinear map, namely logistic map, and a simple finite trigonometric series. We predict three nonlinear systems, namely Lorenz, Rössler, and Hindmarsh-Rose, for temporal tasks and a seventh order polynomial for nontemporal tasks with great accuracy. Also, the prediction is made in the presence of noise and found to closely agree with the target. Remarkably, the logistic map performs well and predicts close to the actual or target values. The low values of the root mean square error confirm the accuracy of this method in terms of efficiency. Our approach removes the necessity of continuous dynamical systems for constructing the reservoir in reservoir computing. Moreover, the accurate prediction for the three different nonlinear systems suggests that this method can be considered a general one and can be applied to predict many systems. Finally, we show that the method also accurately anticipates the time series for the future (self prediction).", "authors": "R. Arun, M. Sathish Aravindh, A. Venkatesan, M.

As a result of cosmological expansion, this line is shifted to the decameter range of wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}\\approx18$ m, $\\nu_{obs}\\approx16$ MHz) and is in the band of operating frequencies of these telescopes. The brightness temperature of the predicted sky-averaged global signal ranges from $\\sim-0.08$ to $\\sim0.02$ K, depending on the cosmological model. Such a weak signal is a big challenge even for the world's largest radio telescope in the decameter wavelength range UTR-2, since the signal level of the synchrotron radiation of the Galaxy at these frequencies is 20,000-40,000 K. The paper highlights the peculiarities of spectroscopy at decameter waves, interfering factors of natural and instrumental origin and ways to eliminate them in order to reliably detect the signal in the 21 cm line, which can become an important source of information both about the environment in which the first stars and galaxies were born, and about the nature of dark matter particles and the magnitude of primordial magnetic fields.

In our scenario, large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally but without forming a black hole. This rapid process can lead to a maximal baryogenesis in those regions at the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) epoch at thermal temperatures between 20 MeV and 50 MeV. Compared to another mechanism relying on shock waves associated to the formation of PBHs, our mechanism instead applies to aborted PBHs. Using simulations in numerical relativity, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis and show that the baryon-to-photon ratio is generically between two and three times larger than the relative abundance of PBHs formed at those temperatures. Finally, we show that PBH formation models at the QCD epoch leading to an abundance comparable to the dark matter could have generated a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.", "authors": "Emilie Despontin, Sebastien Clesse, Albert Escrivà, Cristian Joana", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

Moreover, based on this level statistics, we derive the ratio of adjacent gaps and find that for a single sample, it is a $\\delta-$function, which is in excellent agreement with numerical studies. Additionally, unlike disordered systems, in quasiperiodic systems, there are variations in the level spacing distribution across different regions of the spectrum, and increasing the size and increasing the sample are non-equivalent.

{"title": "Strategy for sensing petal mode in presence of AO residual turbulence with pyramid wavefront sensor", "abstract": "With the Extremely Large Telescope-generation telescopes come new challenges. The complexity of these telescopes' pupil creates new problems for Adaptive Optics. In particular, the large spiders necessary to support the massive optics of these telescopes create discontinuities in the wavefront measurement. These discontinuities appear as a new phase error dubbed the `petal mode'. This error is described as a differential piston between the fragment of the pupil separated by the spiders and is responsible for reducing the European Extremely Large Telescope's (ELT) resolution to a 15m telescope resolution. The aim of this paper is to study the measurement of the petal mode by adaptive optics sensors. We want to understand why the Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PyWFS) cannot measure this petal mode under normal conditions and how to allow this measurement by adapting the Adaptive optics control scheme and the PyWFS. To facilitate our study, we consider a simplified version of the petal mode, featuring a simpler pupil than the ELT. We studied specifically how a system that separates the atmospheric turbulence from the petal measurement would behave. The unmodulated PyWFS (uPyWFS) but the uPyWFS does not make accurate measurements in the presence of atmospheric residuals.

We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter.

We provide here an analysis of locally reflection symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonian which attempts at identifying the key features that lead to the localized eigenstates. A weak coupling expansion of closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors demonstrates that the degeneracy of on-site energies occuring at the center of the locally symmetric domains represents the nucleus for eigenstates spreading across the domain. Since the symmetry-related subdomains constituting a locally symmetric domain are isospectral we encounter pairwise degenerate eigenvalues that split linearly with an increasing coupling strength of the subdomains. The coupling to the (non-symmetric) environment in an extended setup then leads to the survival of a certain system specific fraction of linearly splitting eigenvalues. The latter go hand in hand with the eigenstate localization on the locally symmetric domain.

Most of the planetesimals that first reached 500 AU from Proxima Centauri first reached 1200 AU from the star in less than 1 million years. In the considered model, the disk of planetesimals in the outer part of the star's Hill sphere was rather flat. The results may be of interest for understanding the motion of bodies in other exoplanetary systems, especially those with a single dominant planet. The strongly inclined orbits of bodies in the outer part of Proxima Centauri's Hill sphere can primarily result from bodies that entered the Hill sphere from outside. The radius of Proxima Centauri's Hill sphere is an order of magnitude smaller than the radius of the outer boundary of the Hills cloud in the Solar System and two orders of magnitude smaller than the radius of the Sun's Hill sphere. Therefore, it is difficult to expect the existence of a similarly massive cloud around this star as the Oort cloud around the Sun.", "authors": "S. I. Ipatov", "date": "17 Jan 2024"},

The stations of the Square Kilometer Array-Low (SKA-Low) are such digital arrays, where the station calibration is currently performed using conventional interferometric techniques. An alternative calibration technique similar to holography of dish based telescopes has been suggested in the past. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical framework for holography employing tensors, which are multi-way data structures. Self-holography using a reference beam formed with the station under test itself and cross-holography using a different station to obtain the reference beam are unified under the same formalism. Besides, the relation between the two apparently distinct holographic approaches in the literature for phased arrays is shown, and we show that under certain conditions the two methods yield the same results. We test the various holographic techniques on an SKA-Low prototype station Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2) with the Sun as the calibrator. We perform self-holography of AAVS2 and cross-holography with simultaneous observations carried out with another station Engineering Development Array 2.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we introduce a new generation metric inspired by Frechet Inception Distance, but based on GNN energy prediction rather than InceptionV3 used in computer vision. In addition to commonly used metrics like validity, which assesses the plausibility of a structure, this new metric offers a more comprehensive evaluation of our model's capabilities.

{"title": "On the flattening trend of thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7 at ultra-high temperatures", "abstract": "Many crystals, such as lanthanum zirconate (La2Zr2O7), exhibit a flattening trend in thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon has recently been attributed to the inter-band phonon tunneling (or diffuson) contribution using different formalisms. However, the contributions of finite-temperature corrections (e.g., higher-order phonon-scattering, phonon renormalization, and phonon scattering cross-section softening effects) remain unclear. In this work, we predict and compare the thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7 using three distinct first-principles methods. The first method is Green-Kubo molecular dynamics (MD) based on temperature-dependent machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained from ab initio MD simulations, which successfully predict the flattening trend at ultra-high temperatures. The second method is the Peierls Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), within the phonon particle framework, using phonon lifetime that includes all the finite-temperature corrections. Four-phonon scattering is found large but is cancelled by the phonon scattering cross-section softening effect. As a result, BTE with temperature corrections does not reproduce the flattening of thermal conductivity. The third method is Wigner formalism, which includes both phonon particle and wave contributions, which successfully reproduce the flattening of thermal conductivity. Diffuson and phonon contribute about 67% and 28% of thermal conductivity at 1800 K, respectively. The radiation contribution to thermal conductivity is around 5%. The scaling laws of the phonon, diffuson, radiation, and total thermal conductivity are found to be ~T^-1, ~T^0.4, ~T^2, and ~T^-0.4, respectively.

{"title": "Nematic Superconductivity and Its Critical Vestigial Phases in the Quasi-crystal", "abstract": "We propose a general mechanism to realize nematic superconductivity (SC) and reveal its exotic vestigial phases in the quasi-crystal (QC). Starting from a Penrose Hubbard model, our microscopic studies suggest that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism driven SC in the QC is usually gapless due to violation of Anderson's theorem, rendering that both chiral and nematic SCs are common. The nematic SC in the QC can support novel vestigial phases driven by pairing phase fluctuations above its $T_c$. Our combined renormalization group and Monte-Carlo studies provide a phase diagram in which, besides the conventional charge-4e SC, two critical vestigial phases emerge, i.e. the quasi-nematic (Q-N) SC and Q-N metal. In the two Q-N phases, the discrete lattice rotation symmetry is counter-intuitively ``quasi-broken'' with power-law decaying orientation correlations. They separate the phase diagram into various phases connected via Brezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. These remarkable critical vestigial phases, which resemble the intermediate BKT phase in the $q$-state ($q\\ge 5$) clock model, are consequence of the five- (or higher-) fold anisotropy field brought about by the unique QC symmetry, which are absent in conventional crystalline materials.", "authors": "Yu-Bo Liu, Jing Zhou, Fan Yang", "date": "1 Jan 2024 ("},
{"title": "A Dyson Brownian motion model for weak measurements in chaotic quantum systems", "abstract": "We consider a toy model for the study of monitored dynamics in a many-body quantum systems. We study the stochastic Schrodinger equation resulting from the continuous monitoring with a rate $\\Gamma$ of a random hermitian operator chosen at every time from the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Due to invariance by unitary transformations, the dynamics of the eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha=1}^n$ of the density matrix can be decoupled from that of the eigenvectors. Thus, stochastic equations are derived that exactly describe the dynamics of $\\lambda$'s. We consider two regimes: in the presence of an extra dephasing term, which can be generated by imperfect quantum measurements, the density matrix has a stationary distribution, and we show that in the limit of large sizes the distribution of $\\lambda$'s is described by an inverse Marchenko Pastur distribution. In the case of perfect measurements instead, purification eventually occurs and we focus on finite-time dynamics. In this case, remarkably, we find an exact solution for the joint probability distribution of $\\lambda$'s at each time $t$ and for each size $n$. Two relevant regimes emerge: at small times $t\\Gamma= O(1)$, the spectrum is in a Coulomb gas regime, with a well-defined continuous spectral distribution in the limit of $n\\to\\infty$. In that case, all moments of the density matrix become self-averaging and it is possible to characterize the entanglement spectrum exactly. In the limit of large times $t \\Gamma = O(n)$ one enters instead a regime in which the eigenvalues are exponentially separated $\\log(\\lambda_\\alpha/\\lambda_\\beta) = O(\\Gamma t/n)$, but fluctuations $\\sim O(\\sqrt{\\Gamma t/n})$ play an essential role.

{"title": "Origin of zigzag antiferromagnetic orders in XPS3 (X= Fe, Ni) monolayers", "abstract": "Recently, two monolayer magnetic materials, i.e., FePS3 and NiPS3, have been successfully fabricated. Despite that they have the same atomic structure, the two monolayers exhibit distinct magnetic properties. FePS3 holds an out-of-plane zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM-ZZ) structure, while NiPS3 exhibits an in-plane AFM-ZZ structure. However, there is no theoretical model which can properly describe its magnetic ground state due to the lack of a full understanding of its magnetic interactions. Here, by combining the first-principles calculations and the newly developed machine learning method, we construct an exact spin Hamiltonian of the two magnetic materials. Different from the previous studies which failed to fully consider the spin-orbit coupling effect, we find that the AFM-ZZ ground state in FePS3 is stabilized by competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, and combining single-ion anisotropy. Whereas, the often ignored nearest-neighbor biquadratic exchange is responsible for the in-plane AFM-ZZ ground state in NiPS3. We additionally calculate spin-wave spectrum of AFM-ZZ structure in the two monolayers based on the exact spin Hamiltonian, which can be directly verified by the experimental investigation. Our work provides a theoretical framework for the origin of AFM-ZZ ground state in two-dimensional materials.", "authors": "Ping Li, Xueyang Li, Junsheng Feng, Jinyang Ni, Zhi-Xin Guo, Hongjun Xiang", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},

However, this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments. Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response.

{"title": "Strong and Highly Switchable Soft Sticky Adhesives", "abstract": "Many biological systems can form strong adhesion to various materials with complex shapes. The adhesion is further switchable between strongly adhering and completely non-adhering in a simple and fast manner. By contrast, no engineering system has yet achieved the same robust adherence and switching. This limitation severely hinders the advancement of several emerging technologies including biomimetic robots, assembly-based manufacturing, precision medicine, wearable and implantable devices, as well as on-demand material dismantling and recycling for sustainability. Here we present a design approach for strong and highly switchable adhesion by synergizing the surface stickiness, bulk energy dissipation, and stimuli-responsive polymer chains in a thermo-switchable soft sticky adhesive. The adhesive has a high adhesion strength of about 80 kPa with diverse materials at room temperature. The adhesion is highly switchable to near-vanishing (about 0.6 kPa) at an elevated temperature due to the thermo-responsive surface polymer chain retraction. This adhesion switching is reversible and repeatable for many cycles, enabling selective pick-and-release of objects with various materials, shapes, sizes, and weights. The switching time is around 10 s with an adhesive layer of 1 mm, governed by thermal conduction through the adhesive, faster than or comparable to most state-of-the-art methods. The adhesive is self-healing, and can be recycled, dried, stored, reswollen, and reused with nearly intact adhesion and switching properties. The synergistic design combining strong adhesion and stimuli-responsive switching can be potentially extended to various polymer systems, and further enhanced by optimized surface architectures.", "authors": "Qianfeng Yin, Yilmaz Arin Manav, Yichen Wan, Benyamin Davaji, Ruobing Bai", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

We find a critical phase dominated by phase fluctuations of a $Z_{6}$ nematic order parameter and bounded by two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, which displays only quasi-long-range nematic order. The electronic spectrum in the critical phase displays a thermal pseudogap-like behavior, whose properties depend on the anomalous critical exponent. We also show that an out-of-plane magnetic field induces nematic phase fluctuations that suppress the two BKT transitions via a mechanism analogous to the Hall viscoelastic response of the lattice, giving rise to a putative nematic quantum critical point with emergent continuous symmetry. Finally, we demonstrate that even in the case of an untwisted bilayer, a critical phase emerges when the nematic order parameter changes sign between the two layers, establishing an odd-parity nematic state.", "authors": "Virginia Gali, Matthias Hecker, Rafael M.

Spin polarization is clearly identified as the emergence of a spin component parallel to either magnetic field. We show that Onsager's reciprocity is fulfilled when time reversal symmetry is present and no spin polarization arises, no matter the barrier parameters or the SO strength. Introducing a Buttiker's decoherence probe, that preserves unitarity of time evolution, we show that breaking of TRS results in a strong spin polarization for realistic SO, and barrier strengths.

It is one of the tools to diagnose quantum chaos and unravel the universal dynamics therein. The definition of SFF in most literature only encapsulates the two-level correlation. In this manuscript, we extend the definition of SSF to include the high-order correlation. Specifically, we introduce the standard deviation of energy levels to define correlation functions, from which the generalized spectral form factor (GSFF) can be obtained by Fourier transforms. GSFF provides a more comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of chaotic systems. Using random matrices as examples, we demonstrate new dynamics features that are encoded in GSFF. Remarkably, the GSFF is complex, and both the real and imaginary parts exhibit universal dynamics. For instance, in the two-level correlated case, the real part of GSFF shows a dip-ramp-plateau structure akin to the conventional counterpart, and the imaginary part for different system sizes converges in the long time limit. For the two-level GSFF, the closed analytical forms of the real part are obtained and consistent with numerical results. The results of the imaginary part are obtained by numerical calculation.

Herein, the layered příbramite CuSbSe2 is investigated and discovered to have delocalized free carriers, as shown through optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy and temperature-dependent mobility measurements. Using a combination of theory and experiment, it is found that the underlying factors are: 1) weak coupling to acoustic phonons due to low deformation potentials, as lattice distortions are primarily accommodated through rigid inter-layer movement rather than straining inter-atomic bonds, and 2) weak coupling to optical phonons due to the ionic contributions to the dielectric constant being low compared to electronic contributions.

We consider Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves: (a) that travel in an elastically isotropic, non-piezoelectric substrate, or (b) that propagate along the X direction at the surface of a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ substrate, or (c) that are guided in a thin Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ film grown on a sapphire substrate.

Our results augment the model of active Brownian particles with rigorous expressions for the dissipation that cannot be inferred from their equations of motion, and we illustrate consequences for wall aggregation and motility-induced phase separation.

We find that, for the certain range of hole doping in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\\delta}$, a singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry emerges as long as we keep the doping below the critical value $x_{c}$. Interestingly upon hole doping, the dominant pairing symmetry undergoes a transition to a triplet (odd paring) type from the singlet state. This change in pairing is driven by the competition between the nesting vectors coming from the Fermi surface of $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the CuO$_6$ octahedra. This triplet state is attainable through hole doping, while supressing inter-layer self-doping effects. Furthermore, we present the density of states within the superconducting phase, offering a potential comparison with tunnelling spectra in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\\delta}$.

{"title": "Aqueous Laponite Dispersions are Attractive Gels, Not Repulsive Wigner Glasses: A Critical Commentary", "abstract": "An aqueous dispersion of Laponite has been studied in the literature for over the past three decades. Typically, the aqueous dispersion of Laponite undergoes incessant evolution of its microstructure, wherein its elastic modulus and the mean relaxation time show a continuous increase as a function of time. A considerable amount of discussion has revolved around the nature of this dispersion, specifically whether it can be classified as a repulsive Wigner glass state, characterized by disconnected Laponite particles stabilized by electrostatic repulsions, or an attractive gel state, in which the particles form a percolated space-spanning network. The proponents of the Wigner glass state also conjecture that this system experiences a glass-glass transition after a period of two days has elapsed since its preparation. In this commentary, we explore this topic from a rheological point of view analyzing the published literature and performing new experiments. Aided by additional evidence from the literature, we propose that rheological behavior overwhelmingly suggests that an aqueous dispersion of Laponite undergoes sol - attractive gel transition and remains in the attractive gel state over at least up to 7 days without undergoing any additional transition. Importantly, rheology, despite being a macroscopic tool governed by principles of mechanics, offers profound insight into the microstructure of this particular system. The corresponding analysis conclusively determines the state of an aqueous dispersion of Laponite to be an attractive gel.", "authors": "Yogesh M Joshi, Shrajesh Patel, Khushboo Suman", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

We find strong EPC and a softening of phonon modes in the lowest acoustic branch. While the single MoS$_2$ layer does not actively contribute to the EPC, it significantly elevates the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) compared to monolayer NbSe$_2$. This is attributed to the degradation of the charge-density wave (CDW) by the MoS$_2$ layer. Notably, we observe a two-gap superconductivity in $\\rm{NbSe_2}$/$\\rm{MoS_2}$ and extend our study to three layers of NbSe$_2$. A reduction in $T_c$ with increasing thickness of NbSe$_2$ is observed. We confirm that this trend is consistent with recent experiments, if one goes beyond three layers of NbSe$_2$. We incorporated spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and suggest a possible mechanism for Ising superconductivity.

We observed a softening of one polar phonon in the THz range on cooling towards 460 and 300 K, i.e., temperatures at which $BiMn_{7}O_{12}$ undergoes subsequent structural phase transitions from monoclinic $\\textit{I2/m}$ to polar monoclinic $\\textit{Im}$ and triclinic $\\textit{P1}$ phases. The soft phonon causes dielectric anomalies typical for displacive ferroelectric phase transitions. Microwave measurements performed at 5.8 GHz up to 400 K qualitatively confirmed not only the dielectric anomaly at 300 K, but also revealed two other weak dielectric anomalies near the magnetic phase transitions at 60 K and 28 K. This evidences the multiferroic nature of the low-temperature phases, although the relatively high conductivity in the kHz and Hz spectral range prevented us from directly measuring the permittivity and ferroelectric polarization. Some Raman modes sense the magnetic phase transitions occurring near 60 and 25 K, showing that spin-phonon coupling is relevant in this compound and in this temperature range. The deviation of the Mn-O stretching mode frequency from the anharmonic temperature behavior was successfully explained by the spin correlation function calculated from the magnetic contribution to the specific heat.", "authors": "A.

In this paper, we consider a different class of oscillators, namely a system of (non-Abelian) SU(2)-Lohe oscillators that can also be defined on the 3-sphere, i.e., an oscillator is generalized to be defined as a unit vector in 4D Euclidean space. We demonstrate that such higher-dimensional Kuramoto models with reciprocal and nonreciprocal random interactions represented by a low-rank matrix exhibit a volcano transition as well. We determine the critical coupling strength at which a volcano-like transition occurs, employing an Ott-Antonsen ansatz. Numerical simulations provide additional validations of our analytical findings and reveal the differences in observable collective dynamics prior to and following the transition.

However, despite numerous studies using both analytical and numerical approaches, the nature of the ground state and low-energy excitations in this system remain elusive. This is related to the difficulty in determining the spin gap in various calculations. We present the results of our investigation of the Kagome AFM using the recently developed group equivariant convolutional neural networks - an advanced machine learning technique for studying strongly frustrated models. The approach, combined with variational Monte Carlo, introduces significant improvement of the achievable results accuracy in comparison with approaches based on other neural network architectures that lack generalization quality for frustrated spin systems. Contrary to the results obtained previously with various methods, that predicted Z_2 or U(1) Dirac spin liquid states, our results strongly indicate that the ground state of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet is a spinon pair density wave that does not break time-reversal symmetry or any of the lattice symmetries. The found state appears due to the spinon Cooper pairing instability close to two Dirac points in the spinon energy spectrum and resembles the pair density wave state studied previously in the context of underdoped cuprate superconductors in connection with the pseudogap phase.

{"title": "Spontaneous Supersymmetry Breaking and Nambu-Goldstone Modes in Interacting Majorana Chains", "abstract": "In modern physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the most important and ubiquitous ideas. It is well known that the breakdown of global and continuous symmetry gives rise to gapless excitations called Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons. This is called NG theorem. Since the generators of broken symmetries are bosonic, the excitations are also bosons. On the other hand, excitations are thought of as fermionic when a generator of broken symmetry is fermionic. The most famous example of fermionic symmetry is supersymmetry (SUSY). SUSY is a symmetry that exchanges bosons and fermions. In high-energy physics, it is known that spontaneous SUSY breaking gives rise to massless modes called NG fermions or Nambu- Goldstinos. In non-relativistic systems, fewer examples of models with SUSY are studied. Therefore, spontaneous SUSY breaking in non-relativistic systems is less understood than that in nonrelativistic systems or spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this thesis, we introduce interacting Majorana models with supersymmetry (SUSY) and discuss the properties in terms of spontaneous SUSY breaking and NG modes.", "authors": "Noriaki Sannomiya", "date": "15 Jan 2024"},

In contrast to all previous attempts in this direction, in this work, it is shown that the distribution of margins is driven by that of voter turnout. We use empirical data from $34$ countries to demonstrate that a scaled measure depending on margin and turnout leads to robust universality. Further, a random voting model is introduced which reproduces all the observed universal features. It is also shown that deviations from universality indicate possible electoral malpractices.

This analysis highlight the strong link between linear Boltzmann equations and stochastic optimization methods governed by Markov processes.

{"title": "Skyrmions with a high topological number and phase transition in two-dimensional frustrated J1-J2 magnets", "abstract": "With the rapidly expanded field of two-dimensional(2D) magnetic materials, the frustrated magnetic skyrmions are attracting growing interest recently. Here, based on hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice of $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg spins model, we systematically investigate the frustrated skyrmions and phase transition by micromagnetic simulations and first-principles calculations. The results show that four spin phases of antiferromagnetic, labyrinth domain, skyrmion and ferromagnetic textures are determined by the identified ranges of $J_1$-$J_2$. Importantly, skyrmion phase with an increasing topological number ($Q$) covers a wider $J_1$-$J_2$ area. Then, the diameter of skyrmions can be tuned by the frustration strength ($|J_2/J_1|$) or external magnetic field. Besides, a phase transition from N$\\acute{e}$el to Bloch type skyrmion is observed due to the change of the helicity with the variation of $|J_2/J_1|$. Furthermore, as increasing magnetic field, the skyrmions with high $Q$ ($\\ge 3$) tend to split into the ones with $Q=1$, thereby achieving a lower systematic energy. Additionally, we find that the CoCl$_2$ monolayer satisfies the requirement of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ magnet, and the related magnetic behaviors agree with the above conclusions. The frustration-induced skyrmions are stable without the manipulation of temperature and magnetic field.

The rare paths from laminar to turbulent flow are computed using Adaptive Multilevel Splitting, a rare event simulation method, and are validated against Direct Numerical Simulations at moderately small energy injection rate. The flow is forced outside its natural scales and redistribute energy to the unforced large scales so that the reactive trajectories display forced streamwise velocity tubes at the natural scale of velocity streaks. As the trajectory proceeds, these tubes gradually grow in amplitude until they cross the separatrix between laminar and turbulent flow. Streamwise vortices are visible after velocity tubes have reached near turbulent amplitude. As the domain size is increased from Lx * Lz=6 *4 to 36*24, spatial localisation then extension of the generated coherent streaks and vortices in the spanwise direction is observed. The paths computed in MFU display many of the characteristics of instantons, that often structure noise induced transitions: concentration of trajectories, exponentially increasing waiting times before transition, and Gumbel distribution of trajectory durations. However, bisections started on the reactive trajectories indicate that the trajectory lack two key ingredients of instantons. They do not visit the neighbourhood of the nearest saddle point and do not display the natural relaxation path from that saddle to transitional wall turbulence. The reactive paths do not concentrate more and more around the same trajectory as energy injection rate is decreased, but instead gradually move in phase space.

Recently, a simple system-plus-bath model has been proposed which shows a similar behaviour. Here, we make a general argument as to why such a Page-curve-like entanglement dynamics should be expected to hold generally for system-plus-bath models at small coupling and low temperatures, when the system is initialised in a pure state far from equilibrium. The interaction with the bath will then generate entanglement entropy, but it eventually has to decrease to the value prescribed by the corresponding mean-force Gibbs state. Under those conditions, it is close to the system ground state. We illustrate this on two paradigmatic open-quantum-system models, the exactly solvable harmonic quantum Brownian motion and the spin-boson model, which we study numerically. In the first example we find that the entanglement entropy peaks at intermediate times even if the impurity state stays close to the ground state during the whole evolution.

Using the saddle-point approximation, we derive a set of coupled nonlinear equations which describe competition between the crossover to a heavy-fermion or mixed-valence regimes and conventional superconductivity. We find that superconductivity at strong coupling emerges on par with the development of the many-body coherence in a Kondo lattice. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed with the onset of the Kondo screening and for strong electron-phonon coupling the Kondo screening exhibits a characteristic re-entrant behavior. Even though for both weak and strong coupling limits the suppression of superconductivity is weaker in the mixed-valence regime compared to the local moment one, superconducting critical temperature still remains nonzero. In the weak coupling limit the onset of the many body coherence develops gradually, in the strong coupling limit it emerges abruptly in the mixed valence regime while in the local moment regime the $f$-electrons remain effectively decoupled from the conduction electrons.

In addition, within the magnetically ordered zigzag phase there is a 60$^{\\circ}$ period (i.e. six-fold) sawtooth pattern, which can be explained by reorientation of the zigzag domains as the crystal rotates in the applied field. Suppressing the zigzag order with an applied field above ${\\sim}$ 8 T at low temperature, a six-fold sinusoidal signal remains, suggesting that there is fluctuating zigzag order in the putative field-induced quantum spin liquid state. Finally, our key finding is a sharp, step-like feature that appears at low temperature for fields just above the zigzag phase boundary, at the so-called B2-axes.

The conventional theoretical framework used ubiquitously for interpreting multidimensional spectra of discrete quantum level systems is, however, insufficient for the continua of collective excitations in strongly correlated materials. Here, we develop a theory for 2DTS of a model collective excitation, the Josephson plasma resonance in layered superconductors. Starting from a mean-field approach at temperatures well below the superconducting phase transition, we obtain expressions for the multidimensional nonlinear responses that are amenable to intuition derived from the conventional single-mode scenario. We then consider temperatures near the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, where dynamics beyond mean-field become important and conventional intuition fails. As fluctuations proliferate near $T_c$, the dominant contribution to nonlinear response comes from an optical parametric drive of counter-propagating Josephson plasmons, which gives rise to 2D spectra that are qualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. As such, and in contrast to one-dimensional spectroscopy techniques, such as third harmonic generation, 2DTS can be used to directly probe thermally excited finite-momentum plasmons and their interactions. Our theory provides a clear interpretation of recent 2DTS measurements on cuprates, and we discuss implications beyond the present context of Josephson plasmons.", "authors": "Alex Gómez Salvador, Pavel E.

We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely, a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid (NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS) phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Furthermore, we delve into a comprehensive discussion on the nature of the NSL, exploring aspects such as ground state degeneracy, the local bond energy landscape, and the singlet and triplet gaps on various tori. These analysis provide substantial evidence supporting the nematic nature of the NSL.", "authors": "Jianwei Yang, Zhao Liu, Ling Wang", "date": "7 Jan 2024"},

We begin the investigation by deriving the leading-order magnetic energy associated with a curved planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbon. The sum of the magnetic and the elastic energy is the total energy of the ribbon. We derive the equilibrium equations by taking the first variation of the total energy. We then systematically determine and analyse solutions to these equilibrium equations under various canonical boundary conditions. We also analyse the stability of the equilibrium solutions. Comparing our findings with the well-studied Euler's Elastica provides insights into the magnetic effects on the deformation behaviour of elastic ribbons.

We observe unexpected characteristics that challenge the conventional temperature-dependent behavior of heavy fermion systems, revealing unexpected characteristics. At temperatures above the anticipated coherence temperature (T$^*$), we observe itinerant U 5f electrons at temperatures higher than previously postulated. Additionally, a previously unidentified dispersionless band emerges around 600 meV below the Fermi energy, potentially linked to spin-orbit splitting within the U 5f states. Hybridization between the 5f electrons and conduction band was observed with an energy dispersion of 10 meV at low temperatures, suggesting that U 5f electrons near and at the Fermi surface have an itinerant nature. Temperature-dependent 5d-5f resonance spectra reveal that the 5f electron spectrum weight increases with lowering temperature and begins to decrease at temperatures significantly higher than the Neel temperature (T$_N$). We further show that the competition between the Kondo effect and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions may be responsible for the relocalization of 5f electrons, making relocalization a precursor to the establishment of magnetic order at lower temperatures. Our experiments also provide evidence that 5f electrons with the same orbital are involved in both the Kondo effect and RKKY interactions, suggesting that the two coexist at lower temperatures.", "authors": "Jiao-Jiao Song, Chen Zhang, Qi-Yi Wu, Yin-Zou Zhao, Jan Rusz, John.

Using first-principles calculations, we propose two C4N monolayers with a zigzag buckled (ZB) structure. The ZB C4N monolayers contain raised-C (raised-N) atoms with sp3 hybridization, different from the traditional 2D graphene-like carbon nitride materials with sp2 hybridization. Interestingly, the band structures of the ZB C4N monolayers exhibit quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Dirac nodal line that results from the corresponding quasi-1D structure of the zigzag carbon chains, which is essentially different from the more common ring-shaped nodal line. The quasi-1D Dirac nodal line exhibits the following features: (i) gapless Dirac points, (ii) varying Fermi velocity, and (iii) slightly curved band along the high-symmetry path. All these features are successfully explained by our proposed tight-binding model that includes interactions up to the third nearest-neighbor. The Fermi velocity of the 2D system can reach 105 m/s, which is promising for applications in high-speed electronic devices. The topological flat band structure determined by the Zak phase and band inversion of the corresponding 1D system is edge-dependent, which is corresponding to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, providing to rich physical phenomena.", "authors": "Linyang Li, Jialei Li, Yawei Yu, Yuxuan Song, Jia Li, Xiaobiao Liu, François M.

However, not much is known about how the physical properties are modified by the power of microwaves. We synthesized LaMnO3+d by irradiating oxide precursors with microwaves and studied the impact of microwave power (P = 1000 W, 1200 W, 1400 W and 1600 W) on magnetism, resistivity, magnetoresistance, thermopower, magnetic entropy change, magnetostriction, and electron spin resonance. It is found that paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition becomes sharper, saturation magnetization increases, and electrical resistivity at low temperatures dramatically decreases as P increases. While the resistivity of samples irradiated with MW power of P less than or equal to 1400 W show insulating-like behavior down to 50 K, an insulator-metal transition occurs in the sample exposed to P = 1600 W and this sample also shows a maximum magnetoresistance (= -55%), magneto-thermopower (=-87%), magnetostriction (-180 x10-6) for H = 50 kOe and magnetic entropy change of 4.78 J/kg. K for H = 30 kOe around the Curie temperature. The intensity of electron spin resonance spectra at 300 K increases with P. We postulate that the much enhanced physical properties observed for the P = 1600 W sample arise from the creation of higher hole density, chemical homogeneity, and increased grain size.

Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations, we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress.

Here, through realistic computation of electronic structure, we identify a systematic trend that superconductivity appears to emerge only upon alteration of the low-energy electronic lattice from the underlying honeycomb atomic structure. We then demonstrate that this inhibition can result from from geometric frustration of the bond lattice that disables quantum phase coherence of the order parameter residing on it. In comparison, upon deviating from the honeycomb lattice, relief of geometric frustration allows robust superfluidity with non-trivial spatial structure. For the specific examples of bilayer and trilayer graphene under an external electric field, such bond centered order parameter would develop superfluidity with staggered flux that breaks the time-reversal symmetry.

We find the chaos to be non-maximal almost over the entire phase diagram. Very similar results for chaos indicators are found for the $p$-spin glass chain as a function of temperature and a suitable quantum parameter $\\Gamma$, with some important qualitative differences. In particular, $\\lambda_\\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ exhibit a maximum, coinciding with onset of complex glassy relaxation, above the glass transition as a function of $T$ and $\\Gamma$ in the PM phase of the $p$-spin glass model. In contrast, the maximum is only observed as a function of $S$, but not with temperature, in the PM phase of SY model.

Despite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by large-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, examples of large-scale computational discovery carried through experimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product applicability. Here we demonstrate how this vision became reality by first combining state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models and traditional physics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to quickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around half a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state electrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further identified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a decade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. By employing around one thousand virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, this process took less than 80 hours. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized the structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the Na$_x$Li$_{3-x}$YCl$_6$ ($0 < x < 3$) series, demonstrating the potential of these compounds to serve as solid electrolytes. Additional candidate materials that are currently under experimental investigation could offer more examples of the computational discovery of new phases of Li- and Na-conducting solid electrolytes.

Here, we demonstrate an effective strategy to modulate the thermal transport property of hybrid perovskites by halide alloying. A highly tunable thermal conductivity of mixed-halide hybrid perovskites is achieved due to halide-alloying and structural distortion. Our experimental measurements show that the room temperature thermal conductivity of MAPb(BrxI1-x)3 (x = 0-1) can be largely modulated from 0.27 W/mK (x = 0.5) to 0.47 W/mK (x = 1). Molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that the thermal conductivity reduction of hybrid halide perovskites results from the suppression of the mean free paths of the low-frequency acoustic and optical phonons. It is found that halide alloying and the induced structural distortion can largely increase the scatterings of optical and acoustic phonons, respectively. The confined diffusion of MA+ cations in the octahedra cage is found to act as an additional thermal transport channel in hybrid perovskites and can contribute around 10-20% of the total thermal conductivity. Our findings provide a strategy for tailoring the thermal transport in hybrid halide perovskites which may largely benefit their related applications.", "authors": "Guang Wang, Hongzhao Fan, Zhongwei Chen, Yufei Gao, Zuankai Wang, Zhigang Li, Haipeng Lu, Yanguang Zhou", "date": "1 Jan 2024"},

Carbon ions are expected to transfer larger amounts of energy accordingly to the linear response theory. However, the molecular-level details of the electronic excitation under heavier ion irradiation remain unknown. In this work, we use real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations to examine the quantum-mechanical details of DNA electronic excitations in water under proton, alpha-particle, and carbon ion irradiation. Our results show that the energy transfer does indeed increase for the heavier ions, while the excitation remains highly conformal. However, the increase in the energy transfer rate, measured by electronic stopping power, does not match the prediction by the linear response model, even when accounting for the velocity-dependence of the irradiating ions charge. The simulations also reveal that while the number of holes generated on DNA increases for heavier ions, the increase is only partially responsible for the larger stopping power.

Some of them also change under the application of a weak bias magnetic field at room temperature. Three lowest-frequency modes seen between 200 MHz and 3 GHz were assigned to the dynamics of the magnetic domains. The mode attributed to the natural ferromagnetic resonance exhibits a dramatic critical slowing-down from 25 GHz at 390 K to 5 GHz near the 305 K phase transition, and again a hardening to ~11 GHz on further cooling.

The high sensitivity of the MW spectra to the weak magnetic bias field $H$ < 700 Oe at room temperature is shown to be caused by the transformation of the polydomain magnetic structure in randomly oriented ceramic grains to a monodomain one.

To this end, we report a benchmark on excitation energies computed with the $\\Delta$CCSD and EOM-CCSD methods, for a set of molecular excited-state energies that encompasses not only doubly excited states but also doublet-doublet transitions and (singlet and triplet) singly-excited states of closed-shell systems.

Their extension to periodically driven systems gives rise to exotic new phenomena that are forbidden in thermal equilibrium. Here, we report the observation of signatures of such a phenomenon -- a prethermal topologically ordered time crystal -- with programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a square lattice. By periodically driving the superconducting qubits with a surface-code Hamiltonian, we observe discrete time-translation symmetry breaking dynamics that is only manifested in the subharmonic temporal response of nonlocal logical operators.

To alleviate the covariance-expressiveness dilemma, we propose a hybrid framework with two cascaded regression stages. The first stage, i.e., a theoretically-guaranteed covariant neural network modeling symmetry properties of 3D atom systems, predicts baseline Hamiltonians with theoretically covariant features extracted, assisting the second stage in learning covariance. Meanwhile, the second stage, powered by a non-linear 3D graph Transformer network we propose for structural modeling of atomic systems, refines the first stage's output as a fine-grained prediction of Hamiltonians with better expressiveness capability. The combination of a theoretically covariant yet inevitably less expressive model with a highly expressive non-linear network enables precise, generalizable predictions while maintaining robust covariance under coordinate transformations.

Also, frequent in vitro concentration measurements rely on fluorescence-based methods or direct slicing of the matrix for analyses. These traditional approaches become unreliable if localized and in situ analyses are needed. In contrast, for in situ and real-time analysis of target analytes, surface-engineered optical fibers can be leveraged as a powerful miniaturized tool, which has shown promise from bio to environmental studies. Herein, we demonstrate an optical fiber functionalized with gold nanoparticles using a dip-coating process to investigate the interaction of light with molecules at or near the surface of the optical fiber. Localized surface plasmon resonance from the light-matter interaction enables the detection of minute changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium. We used this principle to assess the in situ molecular distribution of a synthetic drug (methylene blue) in an in vitro matrix (agarose gel) having varying concentrations. Leveraging the probed Z-height in diffused analytes, combined with its in silico data, our platform shows the feasibility of a simple optofluidic tool.

{"title": "Energy balance and damage for brittle fracture: nonlocal formulation", "abstract": "A nonlocal model of peridynamic type for dynamic brittle damage is introduced consisting of two phases, one elastic and the other inelastic. Evolution from the elastic to the inelastic phase depends on material strength. Here inelasticity corresponds to material failure. Existence and uniqueness of the elastic displacement-failure set pair follow from the initial value problem. The displacement-failure pair satisfies energy balance. The length scale of nonlocality $\\epsilon$ is taken to be small relative to the domain in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$. The new nonlocal model delivers a two point strain dynamics on a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\mathbb{R}^d$. This dynamics provides an energy that interpolates between volume energy corresponding to recoverable strain and surface energy corresponding to non recoverable strain. The deformation energy resulting in material failure over a region $R$ is given by a $d-1$ dimensional integral that is uniformly bounded as $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$. For fixed $\\epsilon$, this energy is nonzero for $d-1$ dimensional regions $R$ associated with flat crack surfaces. The failure energy is the Griffith fracture energy for a given crack $R$ in terms of its area for $d=3$ (or length for $d=2$). This energy follows directly from the nonlocal model without sending $\\epsilon$ to zero.

{"title": "The Impact of Thermosolutal Convection on Melting Dynamics of Nano-enhanced Phase Change Materials (NePCM)", "abstract": "Nanoparticle-Enhanced Phase Change Materials (NePCM) have been a subject of intensive research owing to their potential for enhanced thermo-physical properties. However, their behavior during phase change processes, such as melting or solidification, remains inadequately understood\\@. This investigation focuses on the melting process of NePCM in a square cavity, exploring distinct cases of melting from both the top and bottom sides. The NePCM comprises copper nanoparticles (2 nm in size) suspended in water. Our study involves different combinations of constant temperature boundary conditions and particle volume fractions\\@. Utilizing a numerical model based on the one-fluid mixture approach combined with the single-domain enthalpy-porosity model, we account for the phase change process and particles' interaction with the solid-liquid interface. When melting NePCM from the top side, convection effects are suppressed, resulting in a melting process primarily governed by conduction. Both NePCM and pure water melt at the same rate under these conditions. However, melting NePCM from the bottom side induces convection-dominated melting. For pure water, thermal convection leads to the formation of convection cells during melting. Contrastingly, melting NePCM triggers thermosolutal convection due to temperature and particle concentration gradients. The flow cells formed from thermosolutal convection in NePCM differ from those in pure water driven by pure thermal convection. Our simulations reveal that thermosolutal convection contributes to decelerating the solid-liquid interface, thereby prolonging NePCM melting compared to pure water. Surprisingly, the viscosity increase in NePCM plays a minimal role in the deceleration process, contrary to prior literature attributing slow-downs of the melting process of the NePCM primarily to increased viscosity.", "authors": "Yousef El Hasadi", "date": "30 Dec 2023"},

The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process.

Following Syrwid, Kosior, and Sacha (SKS), the notion is that a precise position measurement of one particle can lead to spontaneous formation of a bright soliton that in a time crystal should rotate intact for at least a few revolutions around the ring. In their work SKS find spontaneous formation of a soliton due to the position measurement, but quantum fluctuations cause the soliton to subsequently decay before it has a chance to perform even one revolution of the ring. Based on this they conclude that time crystal dynamics are impossible. In contrast, for our few boson chiral soliton model, and allowing for imprecise (weak) measurements of the particle position, we show that time crystal behavior is possible allowing for several revolutions of the spontaneously formed soliton around the ring.

Even so, it is widely acknowledged that the velocity of waves is irretrievably randomized in scattering media. Here we demonstrate in microwave measurements and numerical simulations that the statistics of velocity of different transmission eigenchannels remain distinct on all length scales and are identical on the incident and output surfaces. The interplay between eigenchannel velocities and transmission eigenvalues determines the energy density within the medium, the diffusion coefficient, and the dynamics of propagation. the diffusion coefficient and all scatter9ng parameters, including the scattering mean free path, oscillate with width of the sample as the number and shape of the propagating channels in the medium change.", "authors": "Azriel Z.

The central idea is to perform a quench from a separable impurity-bath initial state as in the non-equilibrium scenario. The retarded Green's function $G(t+t_0, t'+t_0)$ is then calculated after an equilibration time $t_0$ such that the impurity and bath are approximately in thermal equilibrium. There are two major advantages of this method. First, since we focus on real-time dynamics, we do not need to perform the numerically ill-posed analytic continuation in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo case that relies on imaginary-time evolution. Second, the entanglement growth of the matrix product states in real-time calculations is observed to be much slower than that in imaginary-time calculations, leading to a significant improvement in numerical efficiency.

Specifically, Al can be easily replaced by Ge in the $I4_1md$ phase of LaAlGe, forming the Ge-on-Al antisite, Ge$_{\\rm Al}$. The counterpart, Al-on-Ge (Al$_{\\rm Ge}$), is also probable.

However, the intrinsic spin excitations across the entire Brillouin zone in detwinned FeSe, which forms the basis for a microscopic understanding of the magnetic state and superconductivity, remain to be determined. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to map out the spin excitations of FeSe dewtinned with a uniaxial-strain device. We find that the stripe spin excitations (Q=(1, 0)/(0, 1)) exhibit the $C_2$ symmetry up to $E\\approx120$ meV, while the N{é}el spin excitations (Q=(1, 1)) retain their $C_4$ symmetry in the nematic state. The temperature dependence of the difference in the spin excitations at Q=(1, 0) and (0, 1) for temperatures above the structural phase transition unambiguously shows the establishment of the nematic quantum disordered state. The similarity of the Néel excitations in FeSe and NaFeAs suggests that the Néel excitations are driven by the enhanced electron correlations in the $3d_{xy}$ orbital. By determining the key features of the stripe excitations and fitting their dispersions using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with biquadratic interaction ($J_1$-$K$-$J_2$), we establish a spin-interaction phase diagram and conclude that FeSe is close to a crossover region between the antiferroquadrupolar, Néel, and stripe ordering regimes.

In the present study, we expand upon the analysis of binary colloid mixtures and additionally introduce a third particle species to further our understanding of colloidal systems. Gravitationally driven, spherical colloids immersed in an implicit solvent are confined in two-dimensional linear microchannels. The interaction between the colloids is modeled by the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential, and the confinement of the colloids is realized by hard walls based on the solution of the Smoluchowski equation in half space. In binary and ternary colloidal systems, a difference in the driving force is achieved by differing colloid sizes, but fixed mass density. We observe for both the binary and ternary systems that a driving force difference induces a nonequilibrium phase transition to lanes. For ternary systems, we study the tendency of lane formation in dependence of the diameter of the medium-sized colloids. Here, we find a sweetspot for lane formation in ternary systems. Furthermore, we study the interaction of two differently sized colloids at the channel walls. Recently, we observed that driven large colloids push smaller colloids to the walls. This results in small particle lanes at the walls at early simulation times. In this work, we additionally find that thin lanes are unstable and dissolve over very long time frames. Furthermore, we observe a connection between lane formation and the nonuniform distribution of particles along the channel length. This nonuniform distribution occurs either alongside lane formation or in shared lanes (i.e. lanes consisting of two colloid types).", "authors": "Kay Hofmann, Marc Isele, Artur Erbe, Paul Leiderer, Peter Nielaba", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

Our measurements on a dispersion of silica nanoparticles once again revealed the phenomenology commonly observed for such systems: the formation of a porous solid with linear growth in the channel at short times, slowing down at longer times as the evaporation rate decreases. The growth of the solid is also accompanied by mechanical stresses that are released by the delamination of the solid from the channel walls and the formation of cracks. In addition to these observations, we report original measurements using hydrophilic filler in the PDMS formulation used (Sylgard-184). When the PDMS matrix is in contact with water, water molecules pool around these hydrophilic sites, resulting in the formation of microscopic water clusters whose size depends on the water potential $\\psi$. In our work, we have used these water clusters to estimate the water potential profile in the channel as the porous solid grows. Using a transport model that also takes into account solid delamination in the channel, we then linked these water potential measurements to the hydraulic permeability of the porous solid. These measurements finally enabled us to show that the slowdown in the evaporation rate is due to the invasion of the porous solid by air/water nanomenisci at a critical capillary pressure $\\psi_\\text{cap}$.", "authors": "Hrishikesh Pingulkar, Sonia Maréchal, Jean-Baptiste Salmon", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

These models aim at preserving interactions among coarse-grained variables in a manner that mirrors the underlying atomistic description. We explore here a method for testing coarse-grained vs. all-atom models using stiffness matrices in Fourier space ($q$-stiffnesses), which are particularly suited to probe DNA elasticity at different length scales. We focus on a class of coarse-grained rigid base DNA models known as cgDNA and its most recent version cgDNA+. Our analysis shows that while cgDNA+ follows closely the $q$-stiffnesses of the all-atom model, the original cgDNA shows some deviations for twist and bending variables which are rather strong in the $q \\to 0$ (long length scale) limit. The consequence is that while both cgDNA and cgDNA+ give a suitable description of local elastic behavior, the former misses some effects which manifest themselves at longer length scales. In particular, cgDNA performs poorly on the twist stiffness with a value much lower than expected for long DNA molecules. Conversely, the all-atom and cgDNA+ twist is strongly length scale dependent: DNA is torsionally soft at a few base pair distances, but becomes more rigid at distances of a few dozens base pairs. Our analysis shows that the bending persistence length in all-atom and cgDNA+ is somewhat overestimated.", "authors": "Wout Laeremans, Midas Segers, Aderik Voorspoels, Enrico Carlon, Jef Hooyberghs", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

We observe a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, where the uniform nematic state is kneaded into a continously twisting state, corresponding to a helical director configuration akin to a cholesteric liquid crystal. The transition arises from the hydrodynamic coupling between the liquid crystalline elasticity and the swimmer flow fields, leading to a twist-bend instability of the nematic order.

Our findings in the weak coupling regime agree with field-theory predictions within the ladder approximation.

Recently it was shown experimentally that surface accumulation of microswimmers is impacted primarily by steric forces and short-ranged hydrodynamics.

In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional(3D) model of a microswimmer navigating a volume bounded by a top and bottom surface. We describe the swimmer-surface interaction with an effective short-ranged hydrodynamic alignment force, and study numerically the effect of surface textures, modelled by convex obstacles, on the surface accumulation of chiral and non-chiral microswimmers. We find that, depending on the angular velocity of the swimmer, and the alignment force, convex obstacles can either hinder or enhance surface accumulation.

NMR spectra establish the absence of any dipolar order there, whereas the weak field dependence of the magnetization above $H_{c1}$ is accounted for by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction terms. The low-energy spin dynamics (fluctuations), measured by nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ($T_1^{-1}$), confirms the continuity of this phase and the absence of any low-temperature phase transition. Unexpectedly, the spin dynamics above $H_{c1}$ is largely dominated by two-magnon processes, which is expected above the saturation field of a spin-nematic phase, but not inside. This shows that BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$ is indeed close to a spin-nematic instability, however, this phase is not stabilized.

Specific heat measurements provide evidence for long-range magnetic order below TN = 0.21 K (0.25 K) for YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4). On the other hand, a rather broad maximum is found in the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, located at Tmax = 0.33 K (0.38 K) in YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4), consistent with the quasi-2D magnetism expected for the large separation between the magnetic layers. Estimation of the magnetic entropy supports the expected Kramers' doublet ground state for Yb3+ and the observed paramagnetic behavior is consistent with a well-isolated doublet. Roughly two-thirds of the entropy is consumed above TN, due to a combination of the quasi-2D behavior and magnetic frustration. The impact of frustration is examined from the viewpoint of a simplified J1-J2 square lattice model, which is frustrated for antiferromagnetic interactions. Specifically, a high-temperature series expansion analysis of the temperature-dependent specific heat and magnetization data yields J2/J1 = 0.30 (0.23) for YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4).

In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the escape time of adsorbates from prevalent surface topographies, including holes/pits, pillars, and grooves. Analytical expressions for the probability density function and the mean of the escape time are derived. A particularly interesting scenario is that of very deep and narrow confining spaces within the surface. In this case, the joint effect of the entrapment and stickiness prolongs the escape time, resulting in an effective desorption rate that is dramatically lower than that of the untextured surface. This rate is shown to abide a universal scaling law, which couples the equilibrium constants of adsorption with the relevant confining length scales. While our results are analytical and exact, we also present an approximation for deep and narrow cavities based on an effective description of one dimensional diffusion that is punctuated by motionless adsorption events.

First we derive for the general N-particle FPUT system the transformation to the normal mode representation. Then we specialize to the three-particle FPUT case, and derive analytically the semiclassical energy density of states, and its derivatives in which different singularies are determined, using the Thomas-Fermi rule. The result perfectly agrees with the numerical energy density from the Krylov subspace method, as well as with the energy density obtained by the method of quantum typicality. Here, in paper I, we concentrate on the energy level statistics (level spacing and spacing ratios), in all classical dynamical regimes of interest: the almost entirely regular, the entirely chaotic, and the mixed-type regimes. We clearly confirm, correspondingly, the Poissonian statistics, the GOE statistics, and the Berry-Robnik-Brody (BRB) statistics in the mixed-type regime. It is found that the BRB level spacing distribution perfectly fits the numerical data. The extracted quantum Berry-Robnik parameter is found to agree with the classical value within better than one percent. We discuss the role of localization of chaotic eigenstates, and its appearances, in relation to the classical phase space structure (Poincaré and SALI plots), whose details will be presented in paper II, where the structure and the statistical properties of the Husimi functions in the quantum phase space will be studied.", "authors": "Hua Yan, Marko Robnik", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

In contrast to the ferromagnetic metallic ground state obtained from density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$ gives three ferromagnetic solutions converging to integer moment values (1, 2 \\& 3 $\\mu_B$/f.u) over a range of $U$. Interestingly, two of the solutions are found to exhibit half-metallicity with correspondingly $S$=1/2 and S=3/2 spin states. The half-metallic ferromagnetic state with $S$=3/2 is found to be the ground state solution for SCO. Co atoms show a large deviation from the formal +4 oxidation state indicating the presence of strong covalency effects. Our results suggest a plausible metal to half-metal phase transition around $U$($J$)=4.4(1.16) eV. The Fermi surface study shows gradual collapse in states leading to half-metallicity suggesting \\textit{\\textbf{k}}-dependence of effective $U$ around the critical region. Surprisingly, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), unexpectedly large orbital moment ($L_{z}$=0.6) is noted in SCO putting it among the class of 3$d$ based transition metal compounds exhibiting pronounced orbital magnetization. The calculations give large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of $\\sim$48 meV.

Lithium thiophosphates are among the most promising solid electrolytes, as they exhibit superionic conductivity at room temperature. However, the lack of comprehensive understanding regarding their ion conduction mechanism, especially the effect of structural disorder on ionic conductivity, is a long-standing problem that limits further innovations of all-solid-state LIBs. Here, we address this challenge by establishing and employing a deep learning potential to simulate Li3PS4 electrolyte systems with varying levels of disorder. The results show that disorder-driven diffusion dynamics significantly enhances the room-temperature conductivity. We further establish bridges between dynamical characteristics, local structural features, and atomic rearrangements by applying a machine learning-based structure fingerprint termed \"softness\". This metric allows the classification of the disorder-induced \"soft\" hopping lithium ions.

{"title": "Strictly one dimensional behavior emerging from dispersive two dimensional system: implications on metallic nanowires on semiconducting substrates", "abstract": "We studied single and two Su-Shreiffer-Heeger wires on simple cubic semiconducting substrate. The wire-wire coupling is either perpendicular or diagonal hopping respecting the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries. The hybridization to substrate renormalizes the model parameters of the wires towards the hopping parameter of the substrate without changing the basic nature of perpendicular or diagonal coupling and it can mediate effective perpendicular hopping but not diagonal hopping in the absence of direct wire-wire coupling. This justifies the investigation of multi uniform tight binding wires with perpendicular or diagonal hopping parameters while neglecting the substrate. Perpendicularly coupled uniform wires reveal anisotropic two dimensional band dispersion. Diagonally coupled uniform wires reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel to the wires direction if the intra-wire hopping parameter is larger than twice the diagonal hopping parameter despite strong dispersion perpendicular to the wires. Otherwise, they reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel and perpendicular to the wires direction simultaneously. We established the possibility of realizing strictly one dimensional properties emerging from dispersive two dimensional system if time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries are respected.

We find general analytical expression to support this observation for quadratic fermionic networks. We then apply these ideas to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with periodic boundary conditions and a tight binding model with unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches. In both these cases, we find the specific conditions required for observing CC and study the behavior of these currents with various system parameters. We find that having an unequal number of fermionic sites in the upper and lower branches is enough for generating CC in the SSH model. However, this asymmetry is not adequate for the tight-binding model and we require unequal hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches to induce CC in this model. Finally, we observe that for certain system parameters, the onset point of particle and heat CC are not the same. Based on all these observations, we describe how carefully examining the energy spectrum of the system gives a great deal of information about the possibility and behavior of CC in fermionic systems with asymmetries.", "authors": "Vipul Upadhyay, Rahul Marathe", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

The PPMS and XMCD measurements give information regarding the composition in the bulk of the alloys. The XPS measurements show non-homogeneous composition at the surface of the alloys with a strongly increased Gd content within the first layers compared to the nominal bulk values.

Key structural features in the alloy systems, including crystal phase, chemical ordering, and morphology, are challenging to control at the nanoscale, making it difficult to transfer their usage to industrial applications. In this contribution, we focus on the gold/silver system that has two of the most prevalent noble metals, and combine experiments with simulations to uncover the formation mechanisms at the atomic-level. Nanoparticles are produced using state-of-the-art inert-gas aggregation source and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are employed to model the crystallization process from liquid droplets to nanocrystals. Our study finds a preponderance of nanoparticles with five-fold symmetric morphology, including icosahedron and decahedron which is consistent with previous results on mono-metallic nanoparticles. However, we observe that gold atoms, rather than silver atoms, segregate at the surface of the obtained nanoparticles for all the considered alloy compositions. These segregation tendencies are in contrast to previous studies and have consequences on the crystallization dynamics and the subsequent crystal ordering. We finally show that the underpinnings of this surprising segregation dynamics is due to charge transfer and electrostatic interactions rather than surface energy considerations.", "authors": "Quentin Gromoff, Patrizio Benzo, Wissam A.

In linear spin-wave theory, this electrically induced torque causes a lasing of the chiral edge magnons along certain edge directions, leading to an enhancement of the spin-wave amplitude.

{"title": "Nearly optimal quasienergy estimation and eigenstate preparation of time-periodic Hamiltonians by Sambe space formalism", "abstract": "Time-periodic (Floquet) systems are one of the most interesting nonequilibrium systems. As the computation of energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians is a central problem in both classical and quantum computation, quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates are the important targets. However, their computation has difficulty of time dependence; the problem can be mapped to a time-independent eigenvalue problem by the Sambe space formalism, but it instead requires additional infinite dimensional space and seems to yield higher computational cost than the time-independent cases. It is still unclear whether they can be computed with guaranteed accuracy as efficiently as the time-independent cases. We address this issue by rigorously deriving the cutoff of the Sambe space to achieve the desired accuracy and organizing quantum algorithms for computing quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates based on the cutoff. The quantum algorithms return quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates with guaranteed accuracy like Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which is the optimal algorithm for outputting energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians. While the time periodicity provides the additional dimension for the Sambe space and ramifies the eigenstates, the query complexity of the algorithms achieves the near-optimal scaling in allwable errors. In addition, as a by-product of these algorithms, we also organize a quantum algorithm for Floquet eigenstate preparation, in which a preferred gapped Floquet eigenstate can be deterministically implemented with nearly optimal query complexity in the gap.

Comparing within the various configurations of a particular charge (electron or hole) selective layer, the structural distortion of the Si slab is the lowest for $\\alpha$--As/Si and $\\beta$-Bi/Si.

{"title": "Stability of Hydrides in Sub-Neptune Exoplanets with Thick Hydrogen-Rich Atmospheres", "abstract": "Many sub-Neptune exoplanets have been believed to be composed of a thick hydrogen-dominated atmosphere and a high-temperature heavier-element-dominant core. From an assumption that there is no chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicates/metals at the atmosphere-interior boundary, the cores of sub-Neptunes have been modeled with molten silicates and metals (magma) in previous studies. In large sub-Neptunes, pressure at the atmosphere-magma boundary can reach tens of gigapascals where hydrogen is a dense liquid. A recent experiment showed that hydrogen can induce the reduction of Fe$^{2+}$ in (Mg,Fe)O to Fe$^0$ metal at the pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the atmosphere-interior boundary. However, it is unclear if Mg, one of the abundant heavy elements in the planetary interiors, remains oxidized or can be reduced by H. Our experiments in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell found that heating of MgO + Fe to 3500-4900 K (close to or above their melting temperatures) in a H medium leads to the formation of Mg$_2$FeH$_6$ and H$_2$O at 8-13 GPa. At 26-29 GPa, the behavior of the system changes, and Mg-H in an H fluid and H$_2$O were detected with separate FeH$_x$. The observations indicate the dissociation of the Mg-O bond by H and subsequent production of hydride and water. Therefore, the atmosphere-magma interaction can lead to a fundamentally different mineralogy for sub-Neptune exoplanets compared with rocky planets.

For a wide frequency range of the CCP, the minimal current density obtained is significantly smaller compared to the current density of conventional SOT-reversal.

We also verified the robustness of the CCP-driven magnetization reversal at room temperature. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to switch the magnetic states of perpendicular synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) and ferrimagnetic (SFi) nanodevices.

Our method computes the nonuniform polarization charge distribution induced in a colloidal particle by both externally applied electric fields and local electric fields arising from other charged objects in the dispersion. This leads to expressions for electrostatic energies, forces, and torques that enable efficient molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations of colloidal dispersions in electrolytes, which can be harnessed to accurately predict structural and transport properties. We describe an implementation in which colloidal particles are modeled as rigid composites of small spherical beads that tessellate the surface of the particle. The electrostatics calculations are accelerated using a spectrally-accurate particle-mesh-Ewald technique implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of calculations, including the induced dipole moments and forces for one, two, and lattices of spherical colloids in an electric field; the induced dipole moment and torque for anisotropic particles in an electric field; the equilibrium distribution of ions in the double layer around charged colloids; the dynamics of charged colloids; and ions in the double layer around a polarizable colloid exposed to an electric field.", "authors": "Emily Krucker-Velasquez, James W.

Their nexus yields three significant research directions: competition between distinct interactions, as in the multiple intertwined phases, interplay between interactions and topology that drives the phenomena in twisted layered materials and topological magnets, and the coalescence of multiple topological orders to generate distinct novel phases. The first two examples have grown into major areas of research, while the last example remains mostly untouched, mainly because of the lack of a material platform for experimental studies. Here, using tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical analysis, we unveil a \"hybrid\" and yet novel topological phase of matter in the simple elemental solid arsenic. Through a unique bulk-surface-edge correspondence, we uncover that arsenic features a conjoined strong and higher-order topology, stabilizing a hybrid topological phase. While momentum-space spectroscopy measurements show signs of topological surface states, real-space microscopy measurements unravel a unique geometry of topology-induced step edge conduction channels revealed on various forms of natural nanostructures on the surface. Using theoretical models, we show that the existence of gapless step edge states in arsenic relies on the simultaneous presence of both a nontrivial strong Z2 invariant and a nontrivial higher-order topological invariant, providing experimental evidence for hybrid topology and its realization in a single crystal.

{"title": "Sensitivity of peptide conformational dynamics in carbon nanotubes to directional mechanical forces", "abstract": "In living organisms, proteins and peptides are often under the influence of mechanical forces, especially in confined spaces such as membrane channels, ribosome exit tunnel, or proteasome gate. Due to the directional nature of proteins as polymers with distinct ends, forces have the potential to influence protein conformational dynamics in a direction-dependent manner. In this study, we employed force-probe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of pulling a peptide through a confined environment versus pushing it in the same direction. Our model involves a carbon nanotube and one of three decapeptides with varying amino acid sequences. The simulations reveal that the difference between pulling the C-terminus and pushing the N-terminus is relatively minor when considering the conformational ensembles of the peptides. The loading rate of the force probe and the amino acid sequence of the peptide play a more important role. However, the application of force to the peptide significantly influences the relative motion of the peptides with respect to the nanotube. Pulling the peptide results in a smoother translocation through the nanotube compared to pushing, although the internal conformational dynamics of the peptide add complexity in either case. Our findings shed light on how short peptides navigate confined spaces within the cellular environment, emphasizing the importance of force-probe simulation studies in understanding these processes.", "authors": "Felipe C.

These low-symmetry crystals exhibit unique properties due to the embedded lattice of vacancies. A generalized folding method explains the band structure and the quasi-type-II Dirac point in the Suzuki phase, which is related to the underlying triangular lattice. In analogy to the acoustic valley Hall effect, the Suzuki phase contains three types of topological edge states on the four possible interfaces separating two Suzuki phase crystals with distinct topological phases. The edge states have defined symmetries with inherent directionality, which affect the topological sound transmission and are different from chirality, valley vorticity or helicity. Particularly, the existence of topological deaf bands is here reported. The propagation of topological eigenmodes on the same interface is also different, which is quantified using the acoustic Shannon entropy, making the topological transport dependent on the frequency of the edge states. Based on the abundant topological edge states of Suzuki phase crystals, a multifunctional device with acoustic diodes, multi-channel transmission, and selective acoustic transmission can be designed. Numerical simulations and measurements demonstrate the topological transmission.

However, when one limits themselves to superselection-resolved entanglement, that is, entanglement corresponding to specific gauge symmetry sectors (commonly denoted as superselection sectors), this problem disappears, and the entanglement becomes well-defined. The study of superselection-resolved entanglement is interesting in LGT for an additional reason: when the gauge symmetry is strictly obeyed, superselection-resolved entanglement becomes the only distillable contribution to the entanglement. In our work, we study the behavior of superselection-resolved entanglement in LGT systems. We employ a tensor network construction for gauge-invariant systems as defined by Zohar and Burrello (2016) and find that, in a vast range of cases, the leading term in superselection-resolved entanglement depends on the number of corners in the partition, that is, corner-law entanglement.

Lanthanide atoms show great potential in this endeavor due to their intrinsic transitions. Here, we investigate Er adatoms on Si(100)-2x1 at 9K using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) coupled to a tunable laser. Er adatoms display two main adsorption configurations that are optically excited between 800 nm and 1200 nm while the STM reads the resulting photocurrents. Our spectroscopic method reveals that various photocurrent signals stem from the bare silicon surface or Er adatoms. Additional photocurrent peaks appear as the signature of the Er adatoms relaxation, triggering efficient dissociation of nearby trapped excitons. Calculations using the density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling correction highlight the origin of the observed photocurrent peaks as specific 4f->4f or 4f->5d transitions.

In this Letter, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the effects of both temporally uncorrelated and correlated quantum noises on entanglement generation and information protection. This investigation reveals that entanglement within the system follows $q^{-1/3}$ scaling for both types of quantum noises, where $q$ represents the noise probability. The scaling arises from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\\text{eff}} \\sim q^{-1}$. Moreover, the timescales of information protection are explored and shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$ scaling for temporally uncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The former scaling can be interpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the latter is a direct consequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct extensive numerical simulations using stabilizer formalism to support the theoretical understanding.

{"title": "The $g$-function and Defect Changing Operators from Wavefunction Overlap on a Fuzzy Sphere", "abstract": "Defects are common in physical systems with boundaries, impurities or extensive measurements. The interaction between bulk and defect can lead to rich physical phenomena. Defects in gapless phases of matter with conformal symmetry usually flow to a defect conformal field theory (dCFT). Understanding the universal properties of dCFTs is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computational strategy applicable to a line defect in arbitrary dimensions. Our main assumption is that the defect has an UV description in terms of a local modification of the Hamiltonian, so that we can compute the overlap between low-energy eigenstates of a system with or without the defect insertion. We argue that these overlaps contains a wealth of conformal data, including the $g$-function, which is an RG monotonic quantity that distinguishes different dCFTs, the scaling dimensions of defect creation operators $\\Delta^{+0}_\\alpha$ and changing operators $\\Delta^{+-}_\\alpha$ that live on the intersection of different types of line defects, and various OPE coefficients. We apply this method to the fuzzy sphere regularization of 3D CFTs and study the magnetic line defect of the 3D Ising CFT. Using exact diagonalization, we report the non-perturbative results $g=0.6055(7),\\Delta^{+0}_0=0.1076(9)$ and $\\Delta^{+-}_0=0.84(4)$ for the first time.

It is commonly utilized in conjunction with the maximum entropy method to derive spectral functions from Euclidean time correlators produced by lattice QCD simulations. This study expands the application of the Bayesian reconstruction entropy to the reconstruction of spectral functions for Matsubara or imaginary-time Green's functions in quantum many-body physics. Furthermore, it extends the Bayesian reconstruction entropy to implement the positive-negative entropy algorithm, enabling the analytic continuations of matrix-valued Green's functions on an element-wise manner. Both the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the matrix-valued Green's functions are treated equally. Benchmark results for the analytic continuations of synthetic Green's functions indicate that the Bayesian reconstruction entropy, when combined with the preblur trick, demonstrates comparable performance to the Shannon-Jaynes entropy.

{"title": "Active fluid networks excite visco-elastic modes for efficient transport", "abstract": "Active fluid transport is a hallmark of many biological transport networks. While animal circulatory systems generally rely on a single heart to drive flows, other organisms employ decentralized local pumps to distribute fluids and nutrients. Here, we study the decentralized pumping mechanism in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum which is locally triggered by active release, uptake, and transport of a chemical solute within the organism's vascular network to drive global oscillations.Based on a conceptual network model combining active elasticity and fluid transport we identify a set of contractile modes specific to each network and show that modes corresponding to large-scale oscillations are preferentially and robustly excited both in model simulations and in experimental data obtained from living Physarum plasmodia. These dominant modes are computed explicitly and shown to drive large-scale flows within the organism. Furthermore, Physarum must transport nutrients over long distances. As each mode corresponds to pure shuttle flow, long-range, directed transport must rely on a non-linear coupling beyond harmonic dynamics. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the network's transport capability is optimized when two dominant modes are excited at a phase shift of $\\pi/2$, resulting in contractile excitations similar to those observed in real Physarum.

{"title": "Droplet morphology-based wettability tuning and design of fog harvesting mesh to minimize mesh-clogging", "abstract": "Fog harvesting relies on intercepting atmospheric or industrial fog by placing a porous obstacle, e.g., a mesh and collecting the deposited water. In the face of global water scarcity, such fog harvesting has emerged as a viable alternative source of potable water. Typical fog harvesting meshes suffer from poor collection efficiency due to aerodynamic bypassing of the oncoming fog stream and poor collection of the deposited water from the mesh. One pestering challenge in this context is the frequent clogging up of mesh pores by the deposited fog water, which not only yields low drainage efficiency but also generates high aerodynamic resistance to the oncoming fog stream, thereby negatively impacting the fog collection efficiency. Minimizing the clogging is possible by rendering the mesh fiber superhydrophobic, but that entails other detrimental effects like premature dripping and flow-induced re-entrainment of water droplets into the fog stream from the mesh fiber. Herein, we improvise on the traditional interweaved metal mesh designs by defining critical parameters, viz., mesh pitch, shade coefficient, and fiber wettability, and deduce their optimal values from numerically and experimentally observed morphology of collected fog-water droplets under various operating scenarios. We extend our investigations over a varying range of mesh-wettability, including superhydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers, and go on to find optimal shade coefficients which would theoretically render clog-proof fog harvesting meshes. The aerodynamic, deposition, and overall collection efficiencies are characterized. Hydrophobic meshes with square pores, having fiber diameters smaller than the capillary length scale of water, and an optimal shade coefficient, are found to be the most effective design of such clog-proof meshes.", "authors": "Arani Mukhopadhyay, Arkadeep Datta, Partha Sarathi Dutta, Amitava Datta, Ranjan Ganguly", "date": "10 Jan 2024"},

We revisit in this context the concept of density-functional derivative discontinuity for neutral excitations, without ever invoking nor using the asymptotic behavior of the ensemble electronic density.

Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases as a result of internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole thermalized by holographic matters. The reflected entropy between the bipartition of a large black hole exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time. In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in a global thermofield double state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting with an environment. The Rényi mutual information within the double-copied SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system and the external interaction with the baths.

A solution of ethane-dithiol in acetonitrile demonstrated rapid (~60 s) and controllable exchange of approximately 90% of the ligands, encompassing structures up to ~800 nm in thickness. Prolonged exposures (>1 h) led to the degradation of the microstructures, with a systematic removal of cQDs regulated by surface-to-bulk ratios and solvent interactions.

We find that at a finite value of the background superfluid velocity a hydrodynamic collective mode crosses to the upper half complex frequency plane, thereby signalling a dynamical instability. At the same time, however, this instability is also thermodynamic, as its onset is controlled by one of the second derivatives of the free energy changing sign. We carry out our analysis in two main setups: the \"probe limit\", where the fluctuations of the temperature and the normal fluid's velocity are frozen, and a complete approach, which includes them. In both cases we test our results with the help of gauge-gravity duality, finding good agreement between the hydrodynamic modes of the boundary theory and the quasinormal modes of the gravity theory. Our criterion for the onset of the instability, which is formulated in a model-independent way, applies to interacting systems irrespective of the strength of interactions, does not rely on boost invariance and does not assume any specific quantum statistics. As a final check, we also show that it yields the Landau critical velocity for Galilean superfluids with Bose-Einstein quasiparticles.", "authors": "Filippo Sottovia", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

However, a recent study (J. Phys. Chem. 2021, 12, 800-807) has highlighted the limitation of xDH methods in calculating the dissociation of the NaCl molecule. This issue has been related to the density and orbitals used for evaluating the energy in xDH methods, which are obtained from lower-rung hybrid density functional approximations (DFAs) and display substantial density errors in the dissociation limit. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of density on several challenging datasets and find that the xDH methods are less sensitive to the density errors compared to semi-local and hybrid DFAs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the self-interaction corrected SCAN density offers superior accuracy compared to the self-consistent SCAN density and Hartree-Fock (HF) density, as evidenced by the charge analysis on the dissociation of heterodimers, such as NaCl and LiF. Building on these insights, we propose a 5-parameter xDH method using the SCAN density and orbitals corrected by the PZ-SIC scheme.

Thermal density functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging phase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the exchange-correlation free energy. Approaches using the adiabatic connection formula are well known at zero temperature and have been recently leveraged at non-zero temperatures as well. In this work, a generalized thermal adiabatic connection (GTAC) formula is proposed, introducing a fictitious temperature parameter. This allows extraction of the exchange-correlation entropy $S_{xc}$ using simulated interaction strength scaling. This procedure, in turn, provides an avenue for approximating the exchange-correlation entropy in a way that preserves consistency with a chosen ground-state approximation. In addition, analysis of $S_{xc}$ as a function of interaction strength suggests new forms for approximations and GTAC itself offers a new framework for exploring both the exact and approximate interplay of temperature, density, and interaction strength across a wide range of conditions.", "authors": "Brittany P.

This paper delves into gradient descent-based learning algorithms, that display a linear structure in their parameter dynamics, reminiscent of the neural tangent kernel. We establish this apparent linearity arises due to weak correlations between the first and higher-order derivatives of the hypothesis function, concerning the parameters, taken around their initial values. This insight suggests that these weak correlations could be the underlying reason for the observed linearization in such systems. As a case in point, we showcase this weak correlations structure within neural networks in the large width limit. Exploiting the relationship between linearity and weak correlations, we derive a bound on deviations from linearity observed during the training trajectory of stochastic gradient descent.

We show that independently estimating thresholds for the $X_L$ (phase-flip), $Y_L$, and $Z_L$ (bit-flip) logical failure rates can give a more confident threshold estimate. Using this method for the XZZX model with a tensor-network based decoder we find that the thresholds converge with code distance to a single value at moderate bias ($\\eta=30, 100$), corresponding to an error rate above the hashing bound.

The impact of the symmetry-breaking dissipators on the long-time dynamics of the driven system are analyzed as functions of the drive strength and detuning, covering the deep quantum to near-classical regimes. Phase localization and frequency entrainment, which are required for synchronization, are discussed in detail. We identify a large parameter space where the oscillators exhibit appreciable phase localization but only weak or no entrainment, indicating the absence of synchronization.

The adjustment of the excitation position of the smaller pump and its combination with the bigger pump for the potential creation induce a position-dependent loss distribution across the system. The localization of the exciton polariton condensate and its control are independent of the orientation of the potential lattice, thus, even in slightly disordered system, one can selectively excite such localized polariton condensates.

{"title": "From ergodicity to Stark many-body localization in spin chains with single-ion anisotropy", "abstract": "The principles of ergodicity and thermalization constitute the foundation of statistical mechanics, positing that a many-body system progressively loses its local information as it evolves. Nevertheless, these principles can be disrupted when thermalization dynamics lead to the conservation of local information, as observed in the phenomenon known as many-body localization. Quantum spin chains provide a fundamental platform for exploring the dynamics of closed interacting quantum many-body systems. This study explores the dynamics of a spin chain with $S\\geq 1/2$ within the Majumdar-Ghosh model, incorporating a non-uniform magnetic field and single-ion anisotropy. Through the use of exact numerical diagonalization, we unveil that a nearly constant-gradient magnetic field suppress thermalization, a phenomenon termed Stark many-body localization (SMBL), previously observed in $S=1/2$ chains. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the sole presence of single-ion anisotropy is sufficient to prevent thermalization in the system. Interestingly, when the magnitudes of the magnetic field and anisotropy are comparable, they compete, favoring delocalization. Despite the potential hindrance of SMBL by single-ion anisotropy in this scenario, it introduces an alternative mechanism for localization. Our interpretation, considering local energetic constraints and resonances between degenerate eigenstates, not only provides insights into SMBL but also opens avenues for future experimental investigations into the enriched phenomenology of disordered free localized $S\\geq 1/2$ systems.", "authors": "M.

Conversely, in two dimensions, Weyl semimetals are believed to require additional symmetries including crystalline symmetries to exist. In this study, we demonstrate that a 2D Weyl semimetal phase can exist in systems with Hamiltonians possessing internal symmetries, such as time reversal ${\\cal T}$, charge conjugation ${\\cal C}$ , and their combined chiral symmetry ${\\cal S} = {\\cal CT}$, only. Starting from a minimal-dimension Dirac Hamiltonian, we establish the presence of a stable Weyl semimetal phase in each of the five chiral classes: AIII, BDI, CII, DIII, and CI in two dimension. Similar to 3D Weyl semimetals where Weyl points possess nontrivial topological charges (Chern number), the Weyl points in WSMs within the 2D chiral classes are characterized by the $Z$ winding numbers. In accordance with the bulk-boundary correspondence, protected Fermi arc edge states emerge, connecting the projections of Weyl points that carry opposite topological charges. Unlike the surface states in 3D WSMs, the edge states of WSMs within 2D chiral classes are completely dispersionless and are always at the zero energy due to the protecting chiral symmetry.", "authors": "Faruk Abdulla", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Binding potential and wetting behaviour of binary liquid mixtures on surfaces", "abstract": "We present a theory for the interfacial wetting phase behaviour of binary liquid mixtures on rigid solid substrates, applicable to both miscible and immiscible mixtures. In particular, we calculate the binding potential as a function of the adsorptions, i.e. the excess amounts of each of the two liquids at the substrate. The binding potential fully describes the corresponding interfacial thermodynamics. Our approach is based on classical density functional theory. Binary liquid mixtures can exhibit complex bulk phase behaviour, including both liquid-liquid and vapour-liquid phase separation, depending on the nature of the interactions between all the particles of the two different liquids, the temperature and the chemical potentials. Here we show that the interplay between the bulk phase behaviour of the mixture and the properties of the interactions with the substrate gives rise to a wide variety of interfacial phase behaviours, including mixing and demixing situations. We find situations where the final state is a coexistence of up to three different phases. We determine how the liquid density profiles close to the substrate change as the interaction parameters are varied and how these determine the form of the binding potential, which in certain cases can be a multi-valued function of the adsorptions. We also present profiles for sessile droplets of both miscible and immiscible binary liquids.", "authors": "Mounirah Areshi, Dmitri Tseluiko, Uwe Thiele, Benjamin D. Goddard, Andrew J.

Predicting this response for large classes of systems becomes particularly challenging if many degrees of freedom are involved and linear response theory cannot be applied. Here, we consider isolated many-body quantum systems which either start out far from equilibrium and then thermalize, or find themselves near thermal equilibrium from the outset. We show that time-periodic perturbations of moderate strength, in the sense that they do not heat up the system too quickly, give rise to the following phenomenon of stalled response: While the driving usually causes quite considerable reactions as long as the unperturbed system is far from equilibrium, the driving effects are strongly suppressed when the unperturbed system approaches thermal equilibrium. Likewise, for systems prepared near thermal equilibrium, the response to the driving is barely noticeable right from the beginning.

We trigger quantum crystallisation by preparing a Mott insulator with one exciton in every site of a shallow artificial lattice. In turn, the Mott phase self-defines a dipolar anti-lattice where additional excitons are confined and spontaneously realise a checkerboard solid at half-filling. We evidence that strong dipolar correlations effectively bound excitonic Mott and checkerboard phases, while screening the artificial lattice confinement. Our observations thus show that lattice models with extended interactions provide a fertile ground to emulate Wigner crystallisation.", "authors": "Camille Lagoin, Kirk Baldwin, Loren Pfeiffer, Francois Dubin", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},

The thermal response of 2M intriguingly shows signatures of correlation with phonons and control over their anharmonicity, depicting magnon-phonon interaction. Further, a few phonons exhibit anomalies across the magnetic transitions implying the presence of spin-phonon coupling. In particular, the phonon modes at ~ 194 cm-1 of Sr2CuTeO6 and ~ 168 cm-1 of Sr2CuWO6, that show a strong correlation with the 2M, exhibit the strongest spin-phonon coupling suggesting their roles in mediating magnon-phonon interactions in these systems.", "authors": "Shalini Badola, Aprajita Joshi, Akriti Singh, Surajit Saha", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Polymer translocation: Effects of confinement", "abstract": "We investigate the influence of varying confinement on the dynamics of polymer translocation through a cone shaped channel. For this, a linear polymer chain is modeled by a self voiding walks (SAWs) on a square lattice. The cis-side of a cone-shaped channel has a finite volume, whereas the trans-side has a semi-infinite space. The confining environment is varied either by changing the position of the back wall while keeping the apex angle fixed or altering the apex angle while keeping the position of the back wall fixed. In both cases, the effective space {\\phi}, which represents the number of monomers in a chain relative to the total number of accessible sites within the cone, is reduced due to the imposed confinement. Consequently, the translocation dynamics are affected. We analyze the entropy of the confined system as a function {\\phi}, which exhibits non-monotonic behaviour. We also calculate the free energy associated with the confinement as a function of a virtual coordinate for different positions of the back wall (base of the cone) along the conical axis for various apex angles.Employing the Fokker-Planck equation, we calculate the translocation time as a function of {\\phi} for different solvent conditions across the pore. Our findings indicate that the translocation time decreases as {\\phi} increases, but it eventually reaches a saturation point at a certain value of {\\phi}. Moreover, we highlight the possibility to control the translocation dynamics by manipulating the solvent quality across the pore.

In this joint theory-experiment work, we investigate the impact of the full exciton energy landscape on polariton absorption and reflectance. By changing the cavity detuning, we vary the polariton energy relative to the unaffected dark excitons in such a way that we open or close specific phonon-driven scattering channels.

{"title": "Information bath and learning processes along geodesics", "abstract": "Learning is a fundamental characteristic of living systems, enabling them to comprehend their environments and make informed decisions. These decision-making processes are inherently influenced by available information about their surroundings and specific objectives. An intriguing perspective is that each process could be optimal under a given set of conditions. Here, a geometric method is introduced for analytically exploring such a perspective. The probability distribution describing the state of the composite system of the environment, termed the information bath, and a decision-maker is discussed on the basis of the entropic concept. This enables one to study the system in analogy with thermodynamics. Learning processes are expressed as the changes of parameters contained in the distribution. For a geometric interpretation of the processes, the manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao metric as the Riemannian metric is considered. This framework allows one to conceptualize the optimality of each process as a state change along a geodesic curve on the manifold, which is referred to here as geodesic learning. Then, the bivariate Gaussian model is presented for illustrating this approach, and its rigorous solution is obtained. There, the correspondence between learning and cooling is made manifest. Evolution of the entropy is evaluated for geodesic learning. The findings are then interpreted in the context of adaptation.

In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of spin current generation under an external electric field due to chiral phonons in a chiral-structure superconductor based on the Bogoliubov de Gennes and the Boltzmann equations. In our mechanism, chiral phonons are induced by electric field due to inversion symmetry breaking and electron-phonon interaction. They work as an effective Zeeman field and hence spin-polarize Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the superconductor. As a result, the spin current carried by quasiparticles flows along the screw axis and shows a quadratic dependence on the electric field at the low-field range, leading to a nonreciprocal spin transport. The spin current also shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence and has a maximum at around the superconducting transition temperature.", "authors": "Dapeng Yao, Mamoru Matsuo, Takehito Yokoyama", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},

Recently their common nature was supposed due to similar doping dependence of their critical temperatures. In the CDW phase, a large frozen deformation of strongly ionic lattice is observed. Like for a single carrier in a highly polarizable lattice, for multiple carriers in it the choice between delocalized states of all the carriers and autolocalized states of some part of them is determined by minimum of free energy of interacting carrier and phonon fields. Applying variational approach, we calculate free energy of a two-liquid system of carriers with cuprates-like dispersion comprising liquid of autolocalized carriers (large polarons and bipolarons) and Fermi liquid of delocalized carriers. Comparing it with the free energy of pure Fermi liquid and calculating (with standard methods of Bose-liquid theory) a temperature of superfluid transition in the large-bipolaron liquid we identify areas with presence of pseudogap (caused by impact of (bi)polaron potential on delocalized quasiparticles), CDW and superconductivity in a phase diagram. They are in the same places as in hole-doped cuprates, and similarly to cuprates the shape of the calculated phase diagram is stable with respect to wide-range change of the system characteristics. Like in cuprates, the calculated temperature of the superconducting transition increases with the number of conducting planes in the unit cell, the calculated superfluid density decreases with doping at overdoping, and the bipolaron density (together with bipolaronic plasmon energy) saturates at optimal doping.

We emphasize the role of the Nambu-Goldstone phase field which is crucial to obtain the collective modes of the superconducting matter field.

For these applications, it is crucial for the module to operate without an external magnetic field, necessitating a combination of a large ANE and a substantial coercive force. However, most materials exhibiting a large ANE typically have a relatively small coercive force. In our research, we have explored the ANE in amorphous ferrimagnetic TbCo alloy films, noting that the coercive force peaks at the magnetization compensation point (MCP). We observed that transverse Seebeck coefficients are amplified with Tb doping, reaching more than 1.0 uV/K over a wide composition range near the MCP, which is three times greater than that of pure Co. Our findings indicate that this enhancement is primarily due to direct conversion, a product of the transverse thermoelectric component and electrical resistivity. TbCo films present several significant advantages for practical use: a large ANE, the capability to exhibit both positive and negative ANE, the flexibility to be deposited on any substrate due to their amorphous nature, a low thermal conductivity, and a large coercive force.

We find that the spin current leakage into the nonmagnetic metal plays a central role during the spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversion, leading to dissymmetric interconversion processes. In particular, spin-to-charge conversion is much less sensitive to the spin current absorption in the nonmagnetic metal than charge-to-spin conversion.

We use a single site DMFT(NRG) in order to study the impact of the conduction band mediated effective hopping of the correlated electrons between the correlated orbitals onto the heavy Fermi liquid formation. Whereas the hybridization of a single impurity model with two distinct conduction bands always adds up constructively, $T_{K}\\propto \\exp(-\\alpha U/(\\Gamma_1+\\Gamma_2))$, we show that this does not have to be the case in lattice models, where, in remarkable contrast, also an emerging low-energy Fermi liquid scale $T_0\\propto \\exp(-\\alpha U/(\\Gamma_1-\\Gamma_2))$ is possible due to quantum interference effects in multi band models. At high symmetry points, heavy Fermi liquid formation is suppressed which is associated with a breakdown of the Kondo effect. This results in an asymptotically scale-invariant (i.e., power-law) spectrum of the correlated orbitals $\\propto|\\omega|^{1/3}$ and a small Fermi surface including only the light quasi-particles.

{"title": "Geometrical frustration in nonlinear mechanics of screw dislocation", "abstract": "The existence of stress singularities and reliance on linear approximations pose significant challenges in comprehending the stress field generation mechanism around dislocations. This study employs differential geometry and calculus of variations to mathematically model and numerically analyse screw dislocations. The kinematics of the dislocation are expressed by the diffeomorphism of the Riemann--Cartan manifold, which includes both the Riemannian metric and affine connection. The modelling begins with a continuous distribution of dislocation density, which is transformed into torsion $\\tau$ through the Hodge duality. The plasticity functional is constructed by applying the Helmholtz decomposition to bundle isomorphism, which is equivalent to the Cartan first structure equation for the intermediate configuration $\\mathcal{B}$. The current configuration is derived by the elastic embedding of $\\mathcal{B}$ into the standard Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The numerical analysis reveals the elastic stress fields effectively eliminate the singularity along the dislocation line and exhibit excellent conformity with Volterra's theory beyond the dislocation core. Geometrical frustration is the direct source of dislocation stress fields, as demonstrated through the multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradients. By leveraging the mathematical properties of the Riemann--Cartan manifold, we demonstrate that the Ricci curvature determines the symmetry of stress fields.

We found that both strain and charge doping can tune the magnetic interactions, and the tuning by charge doping is more significant. Differential charge analysis revealed that the doped charges predominantly accumulate around Te atoms. Based on this insight, we introduced Fe$_{3}$GaI$_{2}$, Fe$_{3}$GaBr$_{2}$, and Fe$_{3}$GaSb$_{2}$ monolayers. The Fe$_{3}$GaI$_{2}$ and Fe$_{3}$GaBr$_{2}$ monolayers contain I and Br atoms rather than Te atoms, emulate electron-doped Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ monolayer, resulting in notably high T$_c$ values of 867 K and 844 K, respectively.

{"title": "Electronic effects in radiation-induced collision cascades in nickel", "abstract": "The accurate treatment of electronic effects in multi-million atom simulations of radiation-induced collision cascades is crucial for reliable predictions of primary radiation damage. In this work, we explore the performance of a recently developed two-temperature molecular dynamics model implementing an electron density-dependent coupling of electronic and atomic subsystems for cascade simulations in nickel. We show that the parameter-free model realistically captures the instantaneous energy losses during all stages of the highly non-equilibrium cascade process. Simulations predict two distinct coupling regimes, corresponding to the rapid electronic stopping energy losses in the early stages of the cascade and to the electron-phonon coupling mechanism in the later stages, without the use of separate coupling terms. The intermediate stage of the cascade dynamics displays a complex energy transfer between the subsystems, which cannot be validated by comparison to either electronic stopping or electron-phonon coupling theories. We therefore compare the predicted atomic mixing, which is sensitive to the energy losses during the intermediate cascade stage, with experimental ion beam mixing measurements. We find good agreement with the experiments, validating the coupling model for the intermediate stage of cascades. Predictions of final defect numbers and cluster sizes are found in line with the predictions of conventional electronic stopping-based methods, while significantly reducing the theoretical uncertainty in the predictions of conventional models stemming from arbitrary choices of thresholds for different coupling terms. Our results represent a notable improvement in cascade damage predictions in nickel, providing validation of the electron density-dependent coupling model for radiation damage simulations in general.", "authors": "Andrea E.

It is also known that if precipitates are connected by dislocations, coarsening is affected by the elastic fields of the dislocations and the pipe diffusivity. Although there is experimental evidence of accelerated coarsening in the presence of dislocations, these studies do not capture the effect of the elastic fields. There exist generic theoretical models that can predict the average sizes and size distributions of coarsening precipitates considering the coherency related elastic stress fields. In this paper, we use a phase field model to study the coarsening of precipitates connected by dislocations, incorporating its elastic fields and pipe diffusivity. Specifically, we study the effects of misfit strain, elastic moduli mismatch, faster pipe mobility and the elastic fields of the dislocation on the morphology and kinetics of the coarsening precipitates. The dilatational component, associated with the edge character of the dislocations interact with the precipitates in an elastically homogeneous system. In an elastically inhomogeneous system, the deviatoric elastic fields also interact with the precipitates influencing the morphology and kinetics of coarsening precipitates. The kinetics of coarsening is different as well, with hard precipitates coarsening faster as compared to soft precipitates, when connected by dislocations. Further, we note that the modified Gibbs-Thomson equation, which was originally derived for an isolated precipitate in an infinite matrix, is also applicable for coarsening precipitates at close proximity.", "authors": "Arjun Varma R, Prita Pant, M P Gururajan", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},

We characterize the golden braid state using different measures of topological entropy and the Lyapunov exponent.

Hence, this work extends quantum-mechanical accuracy to mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations and opens unprecedented possibilities in material design for extreme mechanical conditions with direct atomistic insight at the deformation mesoscale. To accomplish this, we construct a Bayesian machine-learned force field (MLFF) from ab initio quantum training data, enabling direct observations of high-temperature and high-stress dislocation dynamics in single-crystalline Cu with atomistic resolution. In doing so, a generalizable training protocol is developed for construction of MLFFs for dislocation kinetics, with wide-ranging applicability to other single element systems and alloys. The resulting FLARE MLFF provides excellent predictions of static bulk elastic properties, stacking fault widths and energies, dynamic evolutions and mobilities of edge and screw dislocations, as well as cross-slip energy barriers for screw dislocations, all of which are compared to available experimental measurements.

Most of the previous work on finite-time quenches assume that the system is initially in equilibrium and focus on the excess defect density at the end of the quench which decays algebraically in quench time with Kibble-Zurek exponent. Here we are interested in understanding the conditions under which the Kibble-Zurek scalings do not hold and in elucidating the full dynamics of the defect density. We find that depending on the initial conditions and quench time, the dynamics of the defect density can be characterized by coarsening and/or the standard finite-time quench dynamics involving adiabatic evolution and Kibble-Zurek dynamics; the time scales for crossover between these dynamical phases are determined by coarsening time and stationary state relaxation time. As a consequence, the defect density at the end of the quench is either a constant or decays following coarsening laws or Kibble-Zurek scaling. For the Glauber chain, we formulate a low temperature scaling theory and find exact expressions for the final defect density for various initial conditions. For the Kawasaki chain where the dynamic exponents for coarsening and stationary state dynamics are different, we verify the above findings numerically and also examine the effect of unequal dynamic exponents.", "authors": "Lakshita Jindal, Kavita Jain", "date": "9 Jan 2024"},

Previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown that chemically active colloids that consume or produce a chemical can self-organize into clusters with diverse characteristics depending on the effective phoretic interactions. In this paper, we investigate self-organization in systems with multiple chemical species that undergo a network of reactions and multiple colloidal species that participate in different reactions. Active colloids propelled by complex chemical reactions with potentially nonlinear kinetics can be realized using enzymatic reactions that occur on the surface of enzyme-coated particles. To demonstrate how the self-organizing behavior depends on the chemical reactions active colloids catalyze and their chemical environment, we consider first a single type of colloid undergoing a simple catalytic reaction, and compare this often-studied case with self-organization in binary mixtures of colloids with sequential reactions, and binary mixtures with nonlinear autocatalytic reactions. Our results show that in general active colloids at low particle densities can form localized clusters in the presence of bulk chemical reactions and phoretic attractions. The characteristics of the clusters, however, depend on the reaction kinetics in the bulk and on the particles and phoretic coefficients. With one or two chemical species that only undergo surface reactions, the space for possible self-organizations are limited. By considering the additional system parameters that enter the chemical reaction network involving reactions on the colloids and in the fluid, the design space of colloidal self-organization can be enlarged, leading to a variety of non-equilibrium structures.", "authors": "Zhiwei Peng, Raymond Kapral", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

A structural analysis of the transition state ensembles reveals that both the average size and location of the critical nucleation cluster are influenced by surface and nanoscale size effets. Furthermore, we also show that transition state structures in smaller nanodroplets exhibit a more ordered liquid phase, and differentiating between a well-ordered critical cluster and its surrounding disordered liquid phase becomes less evident.

Fluids \\textbf{33}, 023310 (2021)] is considered further to analyze two different problems. First, a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations with respect to the homogeneous steady state (HSS) is carried out to identify the conditions for stability as functions of the wave vector, the coefficients of restitution, and the parameters of the mixture. The analysis, which is based on the results obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in spatial gradients, takes into account the (nonlinear) dependence of the transport coefficients and the cooling rate on the coefficients of restitution and applies in principle to arbitrary values of the concentration, and the mass and diameter ratios. In contrast to the results obtained in the conventional inelastic hard sphere (IHS) model, the results show that all the hydrodynamic modes are stable so that, the HSS is linearly \\emph{stable} with respect to long enough wavelength excitations. As a second application, segregation induced by both a thermal gradient and gravity is studied. A segregation criterion based on the dependence of the thermal diffusion factor $\\Lambda$ on the parameter space of the mixture is derived.

Such a cluster formation frequently accompanies a change in the crystal system, leading to the presence of domains with different crystal orientations. In particular, the cubic symmetry is rarely retained after the cluster formation. Here, we identify a cubic-to-cubic phase transition in lacunar spinel GaNb$_4$Se$_8$, where the change in the lattice parameter is less than 0.0001%. Each Nb$^{3.25+}$ tetramer with seven 4d electrons is distorted into a Nb$^{3+}$ trimer and a Nb$^{4+}$ monomer induced by charge disproportionation among Nb ions. While the Nb$^{3+}$ trimer with six 4d electrons forms spin-singlets in the sigma-bonding orbitals for three Nb-Nb bonds, a localized S=1/2 spin remains on the Nb$^{4+}$ ion. Furthermore, a local electric dipole moment is induced along the three-fold rotation axis of each distorted tetramer by the cluster rearrangement. The electric dipole moments are regularly arranged to maintain the cubic symmetry, giving rise to chiral order.", "authors": "Shunsuke Kitou, Masaki Gen, Yuiga Nakamura, Yusuke Tokunaga, Taka-hisa Arima", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

These intricate structures are composed of cross-linked, semi-flexible bio-filaments, crucial to numerous biological processes. In many biological systems, active self-propelled particles like motor proteins or bacteria navigate these intricate polymer networks. In this study, we develop a computational model of three-dimensional cubic-topological, swollen polymer networks of semi-flexible filaments. We perform Langevin dynamics simulations to investigate the diffusion of active tracer particles navigating through these networks. By analyzing various physical observables, we investigate the effects of mesh-to-particle size ratio, Péclet number of active particles, and bending stiffness of the polymer networks upon active trapped-and-hopping diffusion of the tracer. When the tracer size is equal to or larger than the mesh size, the polymer stiffness substantially enhances trapping while suppressing the hopping process. Notably, the mean trapped time exhibits an exponential growth law to the bending stiffness with an activity-dependent slope. An analytic theory based on the mean first-passage time of active particles in a harmonic potential is developed. Our findings deepen the comprehension of the intricate interplay between the polymer's bending stiffness, tracer size, and the activity of tracer particles.

The rich exciton landscape of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provides potential intervalley scattering pathways via dark excitons to rapidly populate these polaritons. Here, we present a microscopic study exploring the time- and momentum-resolved relaxation of exciton polaritons supported by a \\ce{MoSe2} monolayer integrated within a Fabry-Perot cavity. By exploiting phonon-assisted transitions between momentum-dark excitons and the lower polariton branch, we demonstrate that it is possible to circumvent the bottleneck region and efficiently populate the polariton ground state.

In this approach, the phonon quasiparticle picture of each normal mode can be obtained directly by the velocity autocorrelation function and its power spectrum projected in $q$-space. By employing the retarded one phonon Green's function method, the phonon quasiparticle frequency and lifetime of each independent normal mode are effectively determined. On-the-fly machine learning force fields combine the precision of quantum mechanics and the scale of classical MD to analyze sizable supercells with long-wavelength phonons. This yields accurate LTC by using sufficient $q$-samples in the Brillouin zone, which cannot be achieved at the \\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics scale. The convergent LTC tensor of bulk and monolayer ZrSe$_2$ decays faster with increasing temperature than the well-known $\\frac{1}{T}$ scale, which is typically observed when considering only three-phonon scattering. The phonon lifetime and mean free path exhibit significant dependence on temperature. MD simulations encompass all orders of anharmonic effects, thereby enabling an accurate description of anharmonic interactions between phonons at finite temperatures.

However, various applications of superconductors require reconfigurable steering of fluxons, which is hard to realize with geometrically predefined vortex pinning landscapes. Here, on the basis of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, we present an approach for steering of vortex chains and vortex jets in superconductor nanotubes containing a slit. The idea is based on tilting of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ at an angle $\\alpha$ in the plane perpendicular to the axis of a nanotube carrying an azimuthal transport current. Namely, while at $\\alpha=0^\\circ$ vortices move paraxially in opposite directions within each half-tube, an increase of $\\alpha$ displaces the areas with the close-to-maximum normal component $|B_\\mathrm{n}|$ to the close(opposite)-to-slit regions, giving rise to descending (ascending) branches in the induced-voltage frequency spectrum $f_\\mathrm{U}(\\alpha)$.

In this study, we investigate on the relative resistance and current modulation of a 24-dimensional conductimetric electronic nose, which uses the exponential moving average as a floating reference in a low-cost information descriptor for environment recognition. In particular, we identified that depending on the structure of a linear classifier, the 'modema' descriptor is optimized for different material sensing elements' contributions to classify information patterns. The low-pass filtering optimization leads to opposite behaviors between unsupervised and supervised learning: the latter one favors longer integration of the reference, allowing to recognize five different classes over 90%, while the first one prefers using the latest events as its reference to clusterize patterns by environment nature.

These HOCA generate intricate patterns within the spacetime lattice, which can be utilized to create symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. The symmetries of these phases are not global, but act on lower-dimensional subsystems of the lattice, such as lines or fractals. These are referred to as HOCA generated SPT (HGSPT) phases. These phases naturally encompass previously studied phases with subsystem symmetries, including symmetry-protected topological phases protected by symmetries supported on regular (e.g., line-like, membrane-like) and fractal subsystems. Moreover, these phases include models with subsystem symmetries that extend beyond previously studied phases. They include mixed-subsystem SPT (MSPT) that possess two types of subsystem symmetries simultaneously (for example, fractal and line-like subsystem symmetries or two different fractal symmetries), and chaotic SPT (CSPT) that have chaos-like symmetries, beyond the classification of fractal or regular subsystems.

The electrocatalytic performance is evaluated based on several descriptors including electronic property, carrier mobility, Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta$G$_{HER}$), exchange current density etc. The electronic properties are crucially sensitive to the width (N) of BPRs transiting it from semiconducting to metallic nature at N=18.

Modeling the measured Doppler spectra from clean Au and Cu surfaces using gamma spectra obtained from ab initio calculations after considering the detector energy resolution and surface positronium formation pointed to an increase in the relative contribution of gamma from positron annihilation with valence shell electrons. The fit result also suggests that the surface-trapped positrons predominantly annihilated with the delocalized valence shell (s and p) electrons that extended into the vacuum as compared to the highly localized d electrons. Simultaneous DBS and PAES measurements from adsorbate (sulfur, oxygen, carbon) or thin film (selenium (Se), graphene) covered Cu surface showed that it is possible to distinguish and quantify the surface adsorbate and thin-film composition just based on DBS.

Simultaneously, a significant reduction of the out-of-plane component acts as a fingerprint of the emerging hole pocket. Comparison with infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$ uncovers a substantially enhanced optical response and anisotropy for the bilayer compound, reflecting fundamental differences in the electronic structure.

The effective tunability of spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) in bulk and at the interfaces of hybrid materials stacking is a prerequisite for scaling down the dimension and power consumption of these devices. In this work, we demonstrate the strong chemisorption of C60 molecules when grown on the high SOC $\\beta$-W layer. The parent CFB/$\\beta$-W bilayer exhibits large spin-to-charge interconversion efficiency, which can be ascribed to the interfacial SOC observed at the Ferromagnet/Heavy metal interface. Further, the adsorption of C60 molecules on $\\beta$-W reduces the effective Gilbert damping by $\\sim$15% in the CFB/$\\beta$-W/C60 heterostructures. The anti-damping is accompanied by a gigantic $\\sim$115% enhancement in the spin-pumping induced output voltage owing to the molecular hybridization. The non-collinear Density Functional Theory calculations confirm the long-range enhancement of SOC of $\\beta$-W upon the chemisorption of C60 molecules, which in turn can also enhance the SOC at the CFB/$\\beta$-W interface in CFB/$\\beta$-W/C60 heterostructures.

This band exhibits an unusual ground state at half filling in the presence of interaction -- a ferromagnetic Mott insulator. In this paper, we extend the study of this model to other fillings of the quasiflat band and explore the magnetic properties of the ground state at these fillings. In particular, we study four fillings: one-quarter, three-quarters, slightly above half filling (half filling plus two electrons), and slightly below half-filling (half filling minus two electrons). Incorporating interaction within the Hubbard model and using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method to find the ground states, we find that the spin-spin correlation is ferromagnetic at fillings less than half, similar to that observed at half filling, but is antiferromagnetic beyond half filling. Interestingly, these results hold only when mixing between the lowest quasiflat band and the next-to-lowest dispersive band is negligible; once mixing between the two bands is facilitated by increasing the interaction strength, the correlation becomes ferromagnetic above half filling as well. Additionally, by reducing the strength of the interaction in comparison to the bandwidth, a transition from the ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is observed in all the cases.", "authors": "Paban Kumar Patra, Yixuan Huang, Hridis K.

Our numerical results show that an X-shaped structure helps to manipulate its electronic and phononic properties. The transport energy gap can be tuned in the range of ~0.8 eV by changing one arm width. Due to the drastic decrease in the electronic conductance of HETX-CBN and the dominance of the phononic thermal conductance, the ZT performance is degraded despite the high S value (in the order of meV). However, HETX-C has better ZT performance due to better electronic conductance and lower phononic/electronic thermal ratio, it can enhance the ZT ~2.5 times compared to that of zigzag graphene nanoribbon.

When the normal hopping is zero, this model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by the breakdown condensate, while the Mott-condensate transition remains first order. Surprisingly, the breakdown condensate with spontaneously broken exponential U(1) symmetry does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1D. Moreover, we show that the model at non-equilibrium exhibits a dynamical transition from dielectric phase to breakdown phase with respect to the breakdown interaction.

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we perform a shear deformation test, obtaining the stress-strain curve for CuZr metallic glass samples. The atomic configurations of the metallic glass are mapped to a graph, where a node represents an atom whose stress/strain is above a certain threshold, and edges are connections between existing nodes at consecutive timesteps in the simulation. We made a statistical study of some physical descriptors such as shear stress, shear strain, volumetric strain and non-affine displacement to use them as construction tools for complex networks. We have calculated their probability density functions, skewness, kurtosis and gini coefficient to analyze the inequality of the distributions. We study the evolution of the resulting complex network, by computing topological metrics such as degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness and closeness centrality as a function of the strain. We have obtained correlations between the physical phenomena produced by the deformation with the data recorded by these metrics. By means the visual representation of the networks, we have also found direct correlations between metrics and the local atomic shear strain, so that they are able to predict the location of shear bands, as well as the formation of highly connected and interacting communities, which we interpret as shear transformation zones.

{"title": "Hyperelastic swelling of tough hydrogels", "abstract": "Hydrogels are biphasic, swollen polymer networks where elastic deformation is coupled to nanoscale fluid flow. As a consequence, hydrogels can withstand large strains and exhibit nonlinear, hyperelastic properties. For low-modulus hydrogel and semiflexible biopolymer networks, previous studies have shown that these materials universally contract when sheared on timescales much longer than the poroelastic relaxation timescale. Using rheological and tribological measurements, we find that tough polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid hydrogels, with moduli of order ~10-100 kPa, exclusively exhibit dilatancy when sheared. The poroelastic relaxation process was examined using strain-controlled compression, indicating a diffusion constant of order 10^-9 m^2/s. On short timescales (minutes), an applied shear stress induced an increase in normal stress that varied quadratically with shear strain. At long timescales (hours), creep experiments revealed that tough hydrogels can ``remember'' the initial direction of applied shear, suggesting an evolution of the polymer network. Moreover, we show that this dilatant behavior manifests as swelling during tribological sliding, imbibing the hydrogel with fluid. We suggest that this inherent, hyperelastic dilatancy is an important feature in all tough hydrogels, and may explain rehydration and mechanical rejuvenation in biological tissues such as cartilage.", "authors": "Jing Wang, Justin C.

In the case of internal energies or the general case of divalent electrolytes mainly governed by charge correlations, the improved accuracy of the CCDH theory is limited to submolar ion concentrations. Comparison with experimental data from the literature shows that via the adjustment of the hydrated ion radii, the CCDH formalism can equally reproduce the non-uniform effect of salt increment on the ionic activity coefficients up to molar concentrations.

To better understand the stability and surface chemistry of h-BN during plasma-assisted processing, we used polycrystalline Cu foils with single-layer h-BN, grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and tracked in real-time the plasma-induced reduction of the underlying Cu oxide using APXPS equipped with 22 kHz 75 W discharge plasma source operating at 13 Pa. Residual gas analysis (RGA) mass-spectra were concurrently collected during plasma-XPS to track reaction products formed during plasma exposure.

Depending on the Kondo coupling and filling number, three distinct phases, including a metallic paramagnetic, a metallic ferromagnetic, and a gapped spin-density wave phase, are obtained. The spin-density wave is characterized by an ordering wave vector which coincides with the nesting wave vector of the Fermi surface. This makes the corresponding magnetic transition a spin analog of the Peierls transition occurring in the one-dimensional metal. Moreover, by analyzing the momentum distribution function and charge correlation function, the conduction electrons are shown to behave like free spinless fermions in the ferromagnetic phase.

The impact of bending-induced strain on flexible films is studied quite well. However, little is known about the effect of other modes of flexibility, e.g., wrinkling, twisting, peeling, and stretching on the functional properties of flexible films. In this context, perpendicular magnetic anisotropic Co/Pt and Co/Pd thin films are prepared on flexible Kapton substrates, and the impact of the peeling mode is studied in detail. The peeling method generates numerous cracks, and buckling in the thin film, along with localized blister formation imaged by scanning electron microscopy. Further, the resistivity measurement confirms a significant enhancement in sample resistance owing to the severe damage of the films. The structural discontinuities strongly affect the magnetization reversal phenomena as measured by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE)-based microscopy. The bubble domains got converted to elongated-shaped domains due to several hindrances to the wall motion after strain application. Further, the relaxation measurements reveal that the thermal energy is insufficient to switch the magnetization at a few areas due to their high pinning potential associated with the damages.

X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements attest well the high quality of our polycrystalline samples that crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with the Pbam space group. The Raman phonon frequencies were carried out and compared with the lattice dynamics calculations to identify the vibrational properties of all detected modes at room temperature. As expected, our magnetic study reveals that the magnetization was enhanced by the substitution of Y$^{3+}$ by Dy$^{3+}$. The Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ sets the Néel transition [TN (Mn)] in the temperature range going from 40 to 45 K favoring the emergence of a transition at a very low temperature due to the long-range ordering of the Dy3+ magnetic moments below 13K [TN (Dy)]. Dual peaks in the magnetic entropy change curve are also observed being in good agreement with magnetization data, which enlarges the range of application of these materials. On the other hand, a large magnetocaloric effect is observed close to 13 K which is mainly due the ordering of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic moments.

These models exhibit quasi-particle-like excitations when $g=J_2/J_1$ is small, characterized by low-energy magnons, intermediate-energy doublons, and high-energy quartons. The low-energy magnons are associated with the magnetic ground states. They can be described by the linear spin wave theory (LSWT) of the effective block spin model and the original spin model. Doublons and quartons emerge from the corresponding internal excitations of the trimers with distinct energy levels, which can be effectively analyzed using perturbation theory when the ratio of exchange interactions $g$ is small. In this small $g$ regime, we observe a clear separation between the magnon and higher-energy spectra. However, as $g$ increases, these three spectra gradually merge into the magnon modes or continua. Nevertheless, the LSWT fails to provide quantitative descriptions of the higher-energy excitation bands due to significant quantum fluctuations. Notably, in the Collinear II and trimerized hexagon lattice, a broad continuum emerges above the single-magnon spectrum, originating from the quasi-1D physics due to the dilute connections between chains.

Along with the data, we propose that the observed non-monotonic field dependence results from the hybridization of acoustic phonons with spin-flip excitations across the Zeeman gap, where the magnetoelastic coupling arises via modulation of the magnetic $g$-tensor by local strain. This hypothesis aligns with a simple theoretical model that qualitatively reproduces key features of the data on CsYbSe$_2$. Our results provide a starting point to understand the magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity in a broad spectrum of magnetic insulators.", "authors": "Christopher A.

In the clean limit, the dynamics of the order parameter for short times, characterized by a fast exponential growth and an oscillatory pattern, agrees with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) prediction. However, unlike BCS, we observe for longer times an universal exponential decay of these time oscillations that we show explicitly to be induced by the full emergence of spatial inhomogeneities of the order parameter, even in the clean limit, characterized by the exponential growth of its variance. The addition of a weak disorder does not alter these results qualitatively. In this region, the spatial inhomogeneities rapidly develops into an intricate spatial structure consisting of ordered fragmented stripes in perpendicular directions where the order parameter is heavily suppressed especially in the central region. As the disorder strength increases, the fragmented stripes gradually turn into a square lattice of approximately circular spatial regions where the condensate is heavily suppressed. A further increase of disorder leads to the deformation and ultimate destruction of this lattice. We explore suitable settings for the experimental confirmation of these findings.", "authors": "Bo Fan, Antonio M. García-García", "date": "31 Dec 2023 ("},
{"title": "Ferromagnetic Materials for Josephson π Junctions", "abstract": "The past two decades have seen an explosion of work on Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials. Such junctions are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. In the presence of the strong exchange field, spin-singlet Cooper pairs from conventional superconductors undergo rapid oscillations in phase as they propagate through a ferromagnetic material. As a result, the ground-state phase difference across a ferromagnetic Josephson junction oscillates between 0 and $\\pi$ as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic material. $\\pi$-junctions have been proposed as circuit elements in superconducting digital logic and in certain qubit designs for quantum computing. If a junction contains two or more ferromagnetic layers whose relative magnetization directions can be controlled by a small applied magnetic field, then the junction can serve as the foundation for a memory cell. Success in all of those applications requires careful choices of ferromagnetic materials. Often, materials that optimize magnetic properties do not optimize supercurrent propagation, and vice versa. In this review we discuss the significant progress that has been made in identifying and testing a wide range of ferromagnetic materials in Josephson junctions over the past two decades. The review concentrates on metals, not only because that is the area of the authors' expertise, but also because eventual industrial applications of ferromagnetic Josephson junctions will most likely start with metals. We will briefly mention some of the exciting work on spin-triplet supercurrent in junctions containing noncollinear magnetic inhomogeneity, but that topic is not the focus of the review.", "authors": "Norman O.

{"title": "Influence of Surface Roughness on Linear Behavior and Mechanical Properties of Three Cyanoacrylate-Based Adhesives Used to Bond Strain Gages", "abstract": "The challenge of accessing specialized adhesives designed for strain gage applications has been highlighted due to failures in logistic chains, requiring the exploration of local alternatives. A direct simulation of strain gage bonding behavior with two steel plates is infeasible due to the unique construction of strain gages. Therefore, an indirect simulation method, comparing local alternatives to a widely accepted adhesive, Loctite 496, was employed in this study. Two potential replacements, Loctite 401 and Tekbond 793, were tested and matched against the benchmark adhesive, with a focus on the key mechanical properties: Proportional Shear Strain (PSS), Proportional Shear Stress (PSSt), and Apparent Shear Modulus (G*). Loctite 401 exhibited the highest G*, suggesting its potential use in strain gage installations if G* is considered most important. However, Tekbond 793 demonstrated superior PSS, Maximum Shear Stress (MSSt), and Rupture Shear Stress (RSSt) performance, displaying linear behavior even without an accelerator. Surface preparation considerations were also discussed, noting that hand abrading results in double the surface roughness than using an orbital sander. The study further identified two main regions concerning failure modes related to Ra, with values below 0.31 {\\mu}m causing significant variations in observed mechanical properties, pointing towards factors beyond adhesive layer thickness affecting bond properties. Lastly, the general recommendation is the use of an accelerator for all tested adhesives, while the use of a surface conditioner and neutralizer was found to negatively impact adhesive performance.", "authors": "L.

Inspired by recent experiments on integer or fractional quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH/FQAH) states in MoTe2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene, this work examines the archetypal correlated flat band model on a checkerboard lattice at filling {\\nu} = 2/3. Interestingly, at this filling level, we find that this topological flatband does not stabilize conventional FQAH states. Instead, the unique interplay between smectic charge order and topological order gives rise to two intriguing quantum states. As the interaction strength increases, the system first transitions from a Fermi liquid into FQAH smectic (FQAHS) states, where FQAH topological order coexists cooperatively with smectic charge order. With a further increase in interaction strength, the system undergoes another quantum phase transition and evolves into a polar smectic metal. Contrary to conventional smectic order and FQAHS states, this gapless state spontaneously breaks the two-fold rotational symmetry, resulting in a nonzero electric dipole moment and ferroelectric order. In addition to identifying the ground states, large-scale numerical simulations are also used to study low-energy excitations and thermodynamic characteristics. We find that FQAHS states exhibit two distinct temperature scales: the onset of charge order and the onset of the fractional Hall plateau, respectively. Interestingly, the latter is dictated by charge-neutral low-energy excitations with finite momenta, known as magnetorotons. Our studies suggest that these nontrivial phenomena could, in principle, be accessed in future experiments with moiré systems.", "authors": "Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Kai Sun, Zi Yang Meng", "date": "31 Dec 2023 ("},

{"title": "Force Propagation in Active Cytoskeletal Networks", "abstract": "In biological systems, molecular-scale forces and motions are pivotal for enabling processes like motility, shape change, and replication. These forces and motions are organized, amplified, and transmitted across macroscopic scales by active materials such as the cytoskeleton, which drives micron-scale cellular movement and re-organization. Despite the integral role of active materials, understanding how molecular-scale interactions alter macroscopic structure and force propagation remains elusive. This knowledge gap presents challenges to the harnessing and regulation of such dynamics across diverse length scales. Here, we demonstrate how mediating the bundling of microtubules can shift active matter between a global force-transmitting phase and a local force-dissipating phase. A fivefold increase in microtubule effective length results in the transition from local to global phase with a hundredfold increase in velocity autocorrelation. Through theory and simulation, we identify signatures of a percolation-driven transition between the two phases. This provides evidence for how force propagation can be generated when local molecular interactions reach a sufficient length scale. We show that force propagation in the active matter system enables material transport. Consequently, we demonstrate that the global phase is capable of facilitating millimeter-scale human cell transport and manipulation, as well as powering the movement of aqueous droplets. These findings underscore the potential for designing active materials capable of force organization and transmission.

From extensive determinantal and dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the half-filled and quarter-filled Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we show that for sufficiently strong interactions at either half- or quarter-filling, a transition between topological and trivial insulators occurs without the closing of a charge gap. To shed light on this behavior, we illustrate that an exactly solvable model reveals that while the single-particle gap remains, the many-body gap does in fact close. These two gaps are the same in the non-interacting system but depart from each other as the interaction turns on. We purport that for interacting systems, the proper probe of topological phase transitions is the closing of the many-body rather than the single-particle gap.", "authors": "Peizhi Mai, Jinchao Zhao, Thomas A.

The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function.

{"title": "The Kondo effect in the quantum $XX$ spin chain", "abstract": "We investigate the boundary phenomena that arise in a finite-size $XX$ spin chain interacting through an $XX$ interaction with a spin$-\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity located at its edge. Upon Jordan-Wigner transformation, the model is described by a quadratic Fermionic Hamiltonian. Our work displays, within this ostensibly simple model, the emergence of the Kondo effect, a quintessential hallmark of strongly correlated physics. We also show how the Kondo cloud shrinks and turns into a single particle bound state as the impurity coupling increases beyond a critical value. Using both \\textit{Bethe Ansatz} and \\textit{exact diagonalization} techniques, we show that the local moment of the impurity is screened by different mechanisms depending on the ratio of the boundary and bulk coupling. When the ratio falls below the critical value $\\sqrt{2}$, the impurity is screened via the multiparticle Kondo effect. However, when the ratio between the coupling exceeds the critical value , a bound mode is formed at the impurity site which screens the spin of the impurity. We show that the boundary phase transition is reflected in local ground state properties by calculating the spinon density of states, the magnetization at the impurity site in the presence of a global magnetic field, and the finite temperature susceptibility. We find that the spinon density of states in the Kondo phase has the characteristic Lorentzian peak that moves from the Fermi level to the maximum energy of the spinon as the impurity coupling is increased and becomes a localized bound mode in the bound mode phase. Moreover, the impurity magnetization and the finite temperature impurity susceptibility behave differently in the two phases. When the boundary coupling $J_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ exceeds the critical value $\\sqrt{2}J$, the model is no longer boundary conformal invariant as a massive bound mode appears at the impurity site.", "authors": "Pradip Kattel, Yicheng Tang, J.

The collective excitation spectrum, using Bogoliubov-de-Gennes theory, reveals the existence of a diverse range of phases in the SO and Rabi ($k_L-\\Omega$) coupling plane. Based on eigenvalue of the excitation spectrum, we categorize the $k_L-\\Omega$ plane into three distinct regions. In region I, a stable mode with phonon-like excitations is observed. In region IIa, single and multi-band instabilities are noted with a gapped mode, while multi-band instability accompanied by a gapless mode between low-lying and first excited states is realized in region IIb, which also provides evidence of unstable avoided crossing between low-lying and first excited modes The gap between low-lying and first-excited states increases upon increasing the Rabi coupling while decreases upon increase of SO coupling. Using eigenvector analysis, we confirm the presence of the spin-dipole mode in the spin-like modes in Region II. We corroborate the nature of the collective excitation through real-time dynamical evolution of the ground state perturbed with the quench of the trap using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii model. This analysis suggests the presence of dynamical instability leading to the disappearance of the $0$-th component of the condensate. In Region III, mainly encompassing $\\Omega \\sim 0$ and finite $k_L$, we observe phonon-like excitations in both the first excited and the low-lying state. The eigenvectors in this region reveal alternative in- and out-of-phase behaviours of the spin components. Numerical analysis reveals the presence of a super stripe phase for small Rabi coupling in this region, wherein the eigenvector indicates the presence of more complicated spin-like-density mixed modes.", "authors": "Sanu Kumar Gangwar, Rajamanickam Ravisankar, Henrique Fabrelli, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj Kumar Mishra", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},

Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time.

On the Nishimori line, we find the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern retrieval.

Outside of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive tolerance to noise.

Counterintuitively, the way to achieve the number of final particles and each of their masses does not need to rely on evolving the particle system; this result can be obtained by simply considering the initial conditions. Moreover, they can also be used to obtain an accurate approximation of the energy loss.

An outer biaxial-nematic core exhibits a spin half-quantum vortex structure with a uniaxial-nematic inner core. By numerical simulation we demonstrate a dynamical oscillation between the spin-Alice ring and a split-core hedgehog configuration via the appearance of ferromagnetic rings with associated vorticity inside an extended core region. We further show that a similar dynamics is exhibited by a spin-Alice ring surrounding a spin-vortex line resulting from the relaxation of a monopole situated on a spin-vortex line in the biaxial-nematic phase. In the cyclic phase similar states are shown instead to form extended phase-mixing cores containing rings with fractional mass circulation or cores whose spatial shape reflect the order-parameter symmetry of cyclic inner core, depending on the initial configuration.", "authors": "Giuseppe Baio, Magnus O.

Here, we focus on cold atomic gases in optical lattices and propose a novel driving scheme that breaks rotation symmetry but maintains inversion symmetry of the instantaneous Hamiltonian, and discover a novel type of anomalous Floquet topological phase with winding number larger than 1. By analyzing the condition of band touching under symmetry constraint, we map out the phase diagram exactly by varying the driving parameters and discuss the quasienergy spectra of typical topological phases, which can present multiple pairs of edge modes within a single gap.

Calculating and comparing the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of two deformation modes are the key to discussing the mechanical properties reflected by different mechanisms in crystals. Here, the paper proposes a model to predict the CRSS of discrete twins, resembling thin layers, using the elastic anisotropy theory and a macroscopic energy perspective. In addition, the directionality of deformation twinning is also verified. We investigated twinning in FCC crystals to illustrate the methodology, and predicted the CRSS of twinning under different variables such as temperature and strain rate, both of which were in excellent agreement with experimental and other theory results. It draws the conclusion that we can promote twinning nucleation by applying shear stress along the <112> direction to reduce the interface energy as a resistance term and increase the difference in strain energy for twinning nucleation. This conclusion provides a guiding direction for exploring and accurately predicting the conditions of twinning in FCC crystals in future.", "authors": "Jie Huang, Mingyu Lei, Guangpeng Sun, Guochun Yang, Bin Wen", "date": "2 Jan 2024"},

However, the requisite strong spin-orbital coupling in the Ising pairing mechanism generally renders these superconductors heavy-element dominant with notably low superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$). Here, based on the Migdal-Eliashberg theory and the mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of Ising superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$ through surface fluorination, as evidenced by concomitant improvements in $T_c$ and $B_{c2}$. This enhancement arises from three predominant factors. Firstly, fluorine atoms symmetrically and stably adhere to both sides of the monolayer NbSe$_2$, thereby maintaining the out-of-plane mirror symmetry and locking carrier spins out-of-plane. Secondly, fluorination suppresses the charge density wave in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and induces a van Hove singularity in the vicinity of the Fermi level, leading to a marked increase in the number of carriers and, consequently, strengthening the electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Lastly, the appearance of fluorine-related, low-frequency phonon modes further augments the EPC. Our findings suggest a promising avenue to elevate $T_c$ in two-dimensional Ising superconductors without compromising their Ising pairing.", "authors": "Jizheng Wu, Wujun Shi, Chong Wang, Wenhui Duan, Yong Xu, Chen Si", "date": "7 Jan 2024"},

Fyodorov on random linear systems with quadratic constraints, using tools from Random Matrix Theory and replicas. These notes illustrate and complement the material presented at the Summer School organised within the Puglia Summer Trimester 2023 in Bari (Italy). Consider a system of $M$ linear equations in $N$ unknowns, $\\sum_{j=1}^N A_{kj}x_j=b_k$ for $k=1,\\ldots,M$, subject to the constraint that the solutions live on the $N$-sphere, $x_1^2+\\ldots + x_N^2=N$. Assume that both the coefficients $A_{ij}$ and the parameters $b_i$ be independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Using two different approaches -- based on Random Matrix Theory and on a replica calculation -- it is possible to compute whether a large linear system subject to a quadratic constraint is typically solvable or not, as a function of the ratio $\\alpha=M/N$ and the variance $\\sigma^2$ of the $b_i$'s. This is done by defining a quadratic loss function $H({\\bf x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^M\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^NA_{kj} x_j-b_k\\right]^2$ and computing the statistics of its minimal value on the sphere, $E_{min}=\\min_{||\\bf x||^2=N}H({\\bf x})$, which is zero if the system is compatible, and larger than zero if it is incompatible. One finds that there exists a compatibility threshold $0<\\alpha_c<1$, such that systems with $\\alpha>\\alpha_c$ are typically incompatible.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), on the other hand, is a significant 2D transition metal dichalcogenide that has demonstrated promise in a variety of applications. Van der Waals heterostructures, which are created by stacking distinct 2D crystals on top of each other, are becoming increasingly important due to their unique optoelectronic and electromechanical properties. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the mechanical characteristics of vertically stacked Silicene/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructures are examined in this study. The response and structural stability of the heterostructures at various loading orientations and temperatures are given particular attention. The research findings highlight that the fracture strength of the Silicene/MoS2 heterostructure decreases by 40% in both armchair and zigzag orientations when the temperature is raised from 100K to 600K. Furthermore, a linear decrease in Young's modulus is observed as temperature rises. It is noteworthy that the Rule of Mixture (ROM) predictions for Young's Moduli are observed to be marginally lower than the simulation results. The analyses reveal that the silicene layer fractures first under both loading directions shows crack propagation at +-60°in the armchair and predominantly perpendicular in zigzag, followed by subsequent MoS2 layer failure. The study also shows that the MoS2 layer largely determines the elastic properties of the heterostructure, whereas the silicene layer primarily dictates the failure of the heterostructure.

Our findings show that the low pressure FM state is suddenly replaced by a new magnetically ordered phase that is most likely antiferromagnetic that spans from ~ 7 GPa to ~ 11 GPa. Whereas this could be described as an example of avoided quantum criticality, given that clear changes in resistance and Hall data are detected near 6.3 GPa for all temperatures below 300 K, it is also possible that the change in ground state is a response to a pressure induced change in structure. The lack of any discernible change in the pressure dependence of the room temperature unit cell parameter/volume across this whole pressure range suggests that this change in structure is either more subtle than could be detected by our measurements (i.e. development of weak, new wave vector) or the transition is electronic (such as a Lifshitz transition).", "authors": "S.

In order to separate phononic and electronic contributions in the measured longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity, the electronic contributions are estimated from corresponding electrical resisivity and Hall effect measurements on the same samples by using the Wiedemann-Franz law. As may be expected for charge-compensated topological insulators the longitudinal thermal conductivity is phonon-dominated in all samples. However, we also find a pronounced field-linear thermal Hall effect that becomes most pronounced in the low-temperature range, where all samples are good electrical insulators. This indicates an underlying phononic mechanism of the thermal Hall effect and in this respect the topological insulators resemble other, mainly ionic, insulators, which have been reported to show a phonon-induced thermal Hall effect, but its underlying phononic mechanism remains to be identified.

In this work, we present an expansion of the anomalous Hall tensor into symmetrically invariant objects, encoding the magnetic configuration up to arbitrary power of spin. We show that these symmetric invariants can be utilized in conjunction with advanced regularization techniques in order to build models for the electric transport in magnetic textures which are, on one hand, complete with respect to the point group symmetry of the underlying lattice, and on the other hand, depend on a minimal number of order parameters only. Here, using a four-band tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the developed method can be used to address the importance and properties of higher-order contributions to transverse transport.

Despite these applications, the origin of such anisotropy, namely the complex structural and bonding environments in GaTe nanostructures remain to be fully understood. In the present work, we report a comprehensive atomic-scale characterization of m-GaTe by state-of-the-art element-resolved atomic-scale microscopy experiments. By performing imaging for two different view directions, we are able to directly measure the in-plane anisotropy of m-GaTe at the sub-Angstrom level, and show that it compares well with the results of first-principles modeling. Quantum-chemical bonding analyses provide a detailed picture of the atomic neighbor interactions within the layers, revealing that vertical Ga-Ga homopolar bonds get stronger when they are distorted and rotated, inducing the strong in-plane anisotropy.", "authors": "Jieling Tan, Jiang-Jing Wang, Hang-Ming Zhang, Han-Yi Zhang, Heming Li, Yu Wang, Yuxing Zhou, Volker L.

Upon lifting the energy offset, different tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the circular trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet regimes.", "authors": "S. I. Mistakidis, K. Mukherjee, S. M. Reimann, H. R.

However, the measurement of the topological invariants of HOTIs remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose the multipole winding number (MWN) for chiral-symmetric HOTIs, achieved by applying a corner twisted boundary condition. The MWN, arising from both bulk and boundary states, may accurately capture the bulk-corner correspondence in finite systems. To address the measurement challenge, we leverage the perturbative nature of the corner twisted boundary condition and develop a real-space approach for determining the MWN in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. The real-space formula provides an experimentally viable strategy for directly probing the topology of chiral-symmetric HOTIs through dynamical evolution. Our findings not only highlight the twisted boundary condition as a powerful tool for investigating HOTIs, but also establish a paradigm for exploring real-space formulas for the topological invariants of HOTIs.", "authors": "Ling Lin, Chaohong Lee", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

Distinguishing from traditional machine learning models that only predict dynamics from the structural input, the adapted neural network additionally tries to learn structural prototypes under various dynamic patterns in the training phase. Such learned structural constraints can serve as a breakthrough in explaining how structural differences impact dynamics. We further use the proposed model to explore the correlation between the local structure and activation energy in the CuZr metallic glass. Building upon this interpretable model, we demonstrated significant structural differences among particles with distinct activation energies.

{"title": "Thermal fluctuations (eventually) unfold nanoscale origami", "abstract": "There has been a resurgence of interest in using origami principles--along with $2$D materials--to design a wide array of nanoscale devices. In this work, we take cognizance of the fact that small-scale devices are vulnerable to entropic thermal fluctuations and thus a foundational question underlying small-scale origami pertains to its stability. To properly understand the behavior of these origami-based nanodevices, we must simultaneously consider the geometric mechanics of origami along with the interplay between thermal fluctuations, entropic repulsive forces, van der Waals attraction, and other molecular-scale phenomena. In this work, to elucidate the rich behavior underpinning the evolution of an origami device at the nanoscale, we develop a minimal statistical mechanics model of folded nanoscale sheets. We use the model to investigate (1) the thermodynamic multistability of nanoscale origami structures and (2) the rate at which thermal fluctuations drive its unfolding--that is, its temporal stability. We identify, for the first time, an entropic torque that is a critical driving force for the unfolding process. Both the thermodynamic multistability and temporal stability have a nontrivial dependence on the origami's bending stiffness, the radii of curvature of its creases, the ambient temperature, its thickness, and its interfacial energy (between folded layers). Specifically, for graphene, we show that there is a critical side length below which it can no longer be folded with stability; similarly, there exists a critical crease diameter, membrane thickness (e.g. for multilayer graphene), and temperature above which a crease cannot be stably folded. To investigate the rate of thermally driven unfolding, we extend Kramers' escape rate theory to cases where the minima of the energy well occurs at a boundary.", "authors": "Matthew Grasinger, Pradeep Sharma", "date": "8 Jan 2024"},

For electron spin qubits, fast readout stands out as a major obstacle in the pursuit of error correction. In this work, we explore the dispersive measurement of an individual spin in a semiconductor double quantum dot coupled to a nonlinear microwave resonator. By utilizing displaced squeezed vacuum states, we achieve rapid and high-fidelity readout for semiconductor spin qubits. Our findings reveal that introducing modest squeezing and mild nonlinearity can significantly improve both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the fidelity of qubit-state readout. By properly marching the phases of squeezing, the nonlinear strength, and the local oscillator, the optimal readout time can be reduced to the sub-microsecond range.

Here, by employing the cutting-edge momentum-lattice technique, we implement a synthetic SU(2) gauge field in a spinful 1D ladder and study the rich chiral dynamics therein. We confirm the non-Abelian nature of the synthetic potential by observing the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect on a single plaquette. More importantly, the chiral current along the two legs of the ladder is observed to be spin-dependent and highly tunable through the parameters of the gauge potential. We experimentally map out different dynamic regimes of the chiral current, and reveal the underlying competition between overlaying flux ladders with distinct spin compositions.

Although historically linked with water, the Mpemba effect manifests across diverse systems, sparking heightened interest in Mpemba-like phenomena. Concurrently, the Kovacs effect, a memory phenomenon observed in materials like polymers, involves rapid quenching and subsequent temperature changes, resulting in nonmonotonic relaxation behavior. This paper probes the intricacies of the Mpemba and Kovacs effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling, recognized as a simplistic yet effective phenomenological model accommodating memory phenomena. This law allows for a nuanced comprehension of temperature variations, introducing a time delay ($\\tau$) and incorporating specific protocols for the thermal bath temperature, contingent on a defined waiting time ($t_{\\text{w}}$). Remarkably, the relevant parameter space is two-dimensional ($\\tau$ and $t_{\\text{w}}$), with bath temperatures exerting no influence on the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect or the relative strength of the Kovacs effect.

Kinetic methods for reducing the complexity of such systems typically involve the derivation of nonlinear partial differential equations for the corresponding global densities. In recent years there has been considerable interest in the mean field limit of interacting particle systems with long range interactions. Two major examples are interacting Brownian particles in the overdamped regime and the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators. In this paper we analyze these systems in the presence of local or global stochastic resetting, where the position or phase of each particle independently or simultaneously resets to its original value at a random sequence of times generated by a Poisson process. In each case we derive the Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation describing hydrodynamic fluctuations of the global density, and then use a mean field ansatz to obtain the corresponding nonlinear McKean-Vlasov (MV) equation in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show how the MV equation for global resetting is driven by a Poisson shot noise process, reflecting the fact that resetting is common to all of the particles and thus induces correlations that cannot be eliminated by taking a mean field limit. We then investigate the effects of local and global resetting on nonequilibrium stationary solutions of the macroscopic dynamics and, in the case of the Kuramoto model, the reduced dynamics on the Ott-Antonsen manifold.", "authors": "Paul C Bressloff", "date": "7 Jan 2024"},

Our electronic structure calculations shows that both blue and black monolayered phases are semiconductors. On the other hand black phosphorene zigzag nanoribbons are metallic. Similar behavior is found for very thin blue phosphorene zig-zag and armchair nanoribbon. As a general behavior, the exciton binding energy decreases as the ribbon width increases, which highlights the importance of quantum confinement effects. The solution of the BSE shows that the blue phosphorene monolayer has an exciton binding energy four times higher than that of the black phosphorene counterpart. Furthermore, both monolayers show a different linear optical response with respect to light polarization, as black phosphorene is highly anisotropic. We find a similar, but less pronounced, optical anisotropy for blue phosphorene monolayer, caused exclusively by the quasi-particle effects.

The magnetic potential between the patterns is a sum of three contributions: two being periodic on two lattices with different magnitude and orientation, and the third random contribution arising from the distribution of magnetization of the cubes. As one varies the twist angle between the two patterns each time the twist angle coincides with a magic twist angle one of the two periodic lattices becomes a sublattice of the other lattice. Simulations of particles moving through patterns with a precise cube magnetization produce pronounced mobility peaks near magic twist angles that are associated with flat channels. Weak random fluctuations of the cube magnetization in the experiment and the simulations cause enhanced random disorder of the potential and reduce the mobility by scattering particles into the interior of the twisted Wigner Seitz cells.

{"title": "Procedure for Obtaining the Analytical Distribution Function of Relaxation Times for the Analysis of Impedance Spectra using the Fox $H$-function", "abstract": "The interpretation of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data by fitting it to equivalent circuit models has been a standard method of analysis in electrochemistry. However, the inversion of the data from the frequency domain to a distribution function of relaxation times (DFRT) has gained considerable attention for impedance data analysis, as it can reveal more detailed information about the underlying electrochemical processes without requiring a priori knowledge. The focus of this paper is to provide a general procedure for obtaining analytically the DFRT from an impedance model, assuming an elemental Debye relaxation model as the kernel. The procedure consists of first representing the impedance function in terms of the Fox $H$-function, which possesses many useful properties particularly that its Laplace transform is again an $H$-function. From there the DFRT is obtained by two successive iterations of inverse Laplace transforms. In the passage, one can easily obtain an expression for the response function to a step excitation. The procedure is tested and verified on some known impedance models.", "authors": "Anis Allagui, Ahmed Elwakil", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},

However, readout errors from such memory under realistic settings is less understood. We study the problem of decoding quantum information encoded in the groundspaces of topological stabilizer Hamiltonians in the presence of generic perturbations, such as quenched disorder. We first prove that the standard stabilizer-based error correction and decoding schemes work adequately well in such perturbed quantum codes by showing that the decoding error diminishes exponentially in the distance of the underlying unperturbed code. We then prove that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) decoders provide an almost quadratic improvement on the readout error. Thus, we demonstrate provable advantage of using QNNs for decoding realistic quantum error-correcting codes, and our result enables the exploration of a wider range of non-stabilizer codes in the near-term laboratory settings.", "authors": "Weishun Zhong, Oles Shtanko, Ramis Movassagh", "date": "11 Jan 2024"},

Conventional mean-field theories (MFTs) often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. In this article, we propose a novel mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT).DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations but can even detect the topological order of quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders.

The free energy of the system is written in terms of a complex order parameter characteristic of $s$-wave superconductivity and a real (Ising type) order parameter associated to nematicity. The interaction between both order parameters is described by a biquadratic and a trilinear derivative term. To study the effects of these interactions we solve the time-dependent dissipative Ginzburg Landau equations using a highly performant pseudospectral method by which we calculate the trajectories of a vortex that, for different coupling parameters, is either attracted or repelled by a wall, as well as of the wall dynamics. We show that despite its simplicity, this theory displays many phenomena observed experimentally in Fe-based superconductors. In particular we find that the sign of the biquadratic term determines the attractive (pining) or repulsive (antipining) character of the interaction, as observed in FeSe and BaFeCoAs compounds respectively. The trilinear term is responsible for the elliptical shape of vortex cores as well as for the orientation of the axes of the ellipses and vortex trajectories with respect to the axes of the structural lattice. For the case of pining, we show that the vortex core is well described by a heart-shaped structure in agreement with STM experiments performed in FeSe.", "authors": "Ramiro Severino, Pablo Mininni, Eduardo Fradkin, Victoria Bekeris, Gabriela Pasquini, Gustavo Lozano", "date": "12 Jan 2024"},

Quantum annealers have scaled up in recent years to tackle increasingly larger and more highly connected discrete optimization and quantum simulation problems. Nevertheless, despite numerous attempts, a computational quantum advantage in exact optimization using quantum annealing hardware has so far remained elusive. Here, we present evidence for a quantum annealing scaling advantage in approximate optimization. The advantage is relative to the top classical heuristic algorithm: parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves (PT-ICM). The setting is a family of 2D spin-glass problems with high-precision spin-spin interactions. To achieve this advantage, we implement quantum annealing correction (QAC): an embedding of a bit-flip error-correcting code with energy penalties that leverages the properties of the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer to yield over 1,300 error-suppressed logical qubits on a degree-5 interaction graph. We generate random spin-glass instances on this graph and benchmark their time-to-epsilon, a generalization of the time-to-solution metric for low-energy states. We demonstrate that with QAC, quantum annealing exhibits a scaling advantage over PT-ICM at sampling low energy states with an optimality gap of at least 1.0%.

{"title": "Unveiling the hidden reaction kinetic network of carbon in water with first-principles Markov state models", "abstract": "The dissolution of CO$_2$ in water followed by the subsequent hydrolysis reactions is of great importance to the global carbon cycle and carbon capture and storage. Despite enormous previous studies, the reaction pathways and kinetics are still not fully understood at the atomistic scale. Here, we constructed Markov state models based on $ab\\ initio$ molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of dissolved carbon in supercritical water both in the bulk and nanoconfined states. Unlike many previous molecular simulations using enhanced sampling methods, our method can automatically identify complex reaction coordinates and pathways with multiple intermediates using unsupervised machine learning techniques instead of $a\\ priori$ human speculation. In the bulk solution, CO$_2$(aq) tends to directly react with H$_2$O or OH$^-$ to generate HCO$_3^-$ and H$_2$CO$_3$(aq), whereas under graphene nanoconfinement the dissolution of CO$_2$(aq) involves the pyrocarbonate (C$_2$O$_5^{2-}$(aq)) ion as an intermediate state. While it is known that pyrocarbonate does not exist in aqueous solutions, our study suggests that the extreme hydrophobic confinement may greatly enhance the stability of pyrocarbonate ions in water. We found that carbonation reactions involve collective proton transfers along transient water wires, which exhibit concerted behavior in the bulk solution but proceed stepwise under nanoconfinement. Our study provides valuable insights into the reaction kinetic network of aqueous carbon, yielding significant implications for the deep carbon cycle and the sequestration of CO$_2$.

Field theoretical formulations execute the gluing process through the device of emergent gauge fields. Here we study the process of going from the IQH effect of fermionic partons to the FQH effect of bosons by introducing an attractive interaction between the fermions and continuously increasing its strength. It is far from obvious, a priori, that this process could be adiabatic, that is, go through without a gap closing, given that the wave function of the bosonic bound state and its Landau levels (LLs) involve all LLs of the fermions. The absence of an energy cutoff also makes the theoretical study challenging. We proceed by considering fermions on a lattice (a convenient lattice for our purposes is a subdivided icosahedron enclosing a magnetic monopole, which simulates the standard spherical geometry used in theoretical studies of the FQH effect), wherein it is possible to work with the full Hilbert space during the entire process. For all finite systems that we have studied, we find that the system of two species of fermions occupying IQH states evolves adiabatically into the FQH effect of the bosons, suggesting that the process may be adiabatic also in the thermodynamic limit. This physics, reminiscent of the well studied BCS to BEC crossover, can in principle be realized in ultra-cold atomic systems consisting of two species of fermionic atoms in a synthetic magnetic field. Our study suggests that as the strength of the attractive interaction between the fermions of different species is increased, the system will exhibit a crossover, without gap closing, from two independent IQH states of fermionic atoms to a FQH state of bosonic molecules.", "authors": "Koji Kudo, Jonathan Schirmer, Jainendra K.

In the larger $J_2$ and $J_{\\chi}$ coupling regime, the entanglement spectrum of the ground state also exhibits the chiral quasidegeneracy consistent with a CSL, but the adiabatic flux insertion simulations fail to obtain the quantized Chern number. By analyzing the finite-size scaling of magnetic order parameter, we find the vanished magnetic order suggesting a magnetic disorder phase, whose nature needs further studies. Different from the spin-$1$ $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_\\chi$ model, we do not find the coexistent stripe magnetic order and topological order.

This low-spin ground state has been up to now difficult to describe theoretically due to the complexity of the quantum Heisenberg model for this large system. In this work, we are in fact able to quantitatively reproduce the low-spin energy minimum by employing large-scale SU(2)-symmetric density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations using previously published exchange parameters obtained by density-functional theory. We do not find a low-spin state for the same parameters and $S=1$, which leads us to propose that frustrated systems with $S\\geq2$ are inherently prone to weak ferromagnetic interactions. This could account for the prevalence of similar low-spin Mn-based SMMs. Finally, by computing the full magnetization curve, we find wide plateaus at 10/14, 11/14, 12/14 and 13/14 of the saturation.

Using the Ginzburg-Landau formalism in the mean-field limit, we explore the $q$-state Potts model with extra $r$ hidden states. We analytically demonstrate that when $1 < q \\le 2$, the model exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising a variety of phase transitions such as continuous, discontinuous, two types of hybrids, and two consecutive second- and first-order transitions; moreover, several characteristics such as critical, critical endpoint, and tricritical point are identified. The critical line and critical end lines merge in a singular form at the tricritical point. Those complex critical behaviors are not wholly detected in previous research because the research is implemented only numerically. We microscopically investigate the origin of the discontinuous transition; it is induced by the competition between the interaction and entropy of the system in the Ising limit, whereas by the bi-stability of the hidden spin states in the percolation limit.

They could also produce gravitational waves of a frequency observable by future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). All calculations of the gravitational wave power spectrum rely on a relativistic version of the classical nucleation theory of Cahn-Hilliard and Langer, due to Coleman and Linde. The high purity and precise control of pressure and temperature achievable in the laboratory made the first-order A to B transition of superfluid $^3$He an ideal for test of classical nucleation theory. As Leggett and others have noted the theory fails dramatically. The lifetime of the metastable A phase is measurable, typically of order minutes to hours, far faster than classical nucleation theory predicts. If the nucleation of B phase from the supercooled A phase is due to a new, rapid intrinsic mechanism that would have implications for first-order cosmological phase transitions as well as predictions for gravitational wave (GW) production in the early universe. Here we discuss studies of the AB phase transition dynamics in $^3$He, both experimental and theoretical, and show how the computational technology for cosmological phase transition can be used to simulate the dynamics of the A-B transition, support the experimental investigations of the A-B transition in the QUEST-DMC collaboration with the goal of identifying and quantifying the mechanism(s) responsible for nucleation of stable phases in ultra-pure metastable quantum phases.", "authors": "Mark Hindmarsh, J.A.

Here, we first illustrate an obvious inescapable physical inconsistency of such claims concerning the flow velocity. Taking into account this basic principle from the beginning, we then demonstrate that a proper employment of physical statistics naturally reproduces the experimental observation without causing such a conceptual crisis.

Quantitative characterization of SOTs highly relies on the SOT-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR), where a modulated microwave current is used to generate ac SOTs and the modulation-frequency is usually less than 100 kHz (the limit of conventional lock-in amplifiers). Here we have investigated the SOT of typical SOT material/ferromagnet bilayers in an extended modulation-frequency range, up to MHz, by developing the ST-FMR measurement. Remarkably, we found that the measured SOTs are enhanced about three times in the MHz range, which cannot be explained according to present SOT theory. We attribute the enhancement of SOT to additional magnon excitations due to phonon-magnon coupling, which is also reflected in the slight changes of resonant field and linewidth in the acquired ST-FMR spectra, corresponding to the modifications of effective magnetization and damping constant, respectively.

Since the nodal loop semimetal naturally appears as an intermediate gapless phase between the topological and the trivial insulators, a sufficient condition for the nodal loop phase to exist is that the symmetry class must have a nontrivial topological insulator in $d=3$. Our classification uses the winding number on a loop that links the nodal line. A nonzero winding number on a nodal loop implies robust gapless drumhead states on the surface Brillouin zone.

Here we explore the possibility of a deconfined transition between two symmetric Fermi liquids in a bilayer model tuned by inter-layer antiferromagnetic spin-spin coupling $J_\\perp$. Across the transition the Fermi surface volume per flavor jumps by $1/2$ of the Brillouin zone (BZ), similar to the small to large Fermi surface transitions in heavy Fermion systems and maybe also in the high Tc cuprates. But in the bilayer case the small Fermi surface phase (dubbed as sFL) has neither symmetry breaking nor fractionalization, akin to the symmetric mass generation (SMG) discussed in high energy physics. We formulate a deconfined critical theory where the two Fermi liquids correspond to higgs and/or confined phases of a $U(1)\\times U(1)$ gauge theory. We show that this deconfined FL to FL transition (DFFT) fixed point is unstable to pairing and thus a superconductor dome is expected at low temperature. At finite temperature above the pairing scale, microscopic electron is a three particle bound state of the deconfined fractional fermions in the critical theory. We also introduce another parameter which can suppress the pairing instability, leading to a deconfined tri-critical point stable to zero temperature. We also provide numerical results of the bilayer model in one dimension, with a Luther-Emery liquid between two different Luttinger liquids, similar to the phase diagram from the field theory in two dimension.

Until now, the paths followed by the atoms during the B2 to B19' transformation were imagined as independent shears and shuffles. Here, we propose a simplified hard-sphere atomistic model of phase transformation decomposed into three distinct types of atomic movements. The model's inputs are the Ti and Ni atomic or ionic diameters and the monoclinic angle beta. The outputs are the lattice parameters of the B19' phase and the atomic positions. The results are remarkably close to those reported in the literature from X-ray diffraction experiments or DFT simulations. The hard-sphere model explains the change of enthalpy by the formation of short Ti-Ti bonds in B19'. It is also shown that the value of the monoclinic angle beta close to 97.9 degrees corresponds to the highest molar volume among all the possible hard-sphere monoclinic B19' structures; which suggests that it could be a consequence of a maximization of the vibrational entropy. The hard-sphere model was applied in the special case of absence of monoclinicity to predict the B19 structure.

We reveal that the thermal conductivity of liquid water has a sublinear dependency on nanotube length exclusively when water molecules form a single file. Stronger confinement leads to behavioral and structural characteristics closely resembling a one-dimensional nature. Moreover, single-layer-structure water molecules exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity.

We show that growth is logarithmic in time, in stark contrast with the algebraic behavior of lower dimensional random packing models. Equally important, we find that this slow kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict an algebraic growth due to the spontaneous formation of bundles. Our results offer a mechanism for bundle formation resulting purely from volume exclusion, and provide a benchmark for bundling activation and growth during the assembly of physical networks.", "authors": "I.

{"title": "DISO: A Domain Ontology for Modeling Dislocations in Crystalline Materials", "abstract": "Crystalline materials, such as metals and semiconductors, nearly always contain a special defect type called dislocation. This defect decisively determines many important material properties, e.g., strength, fracture toughness, or ductility. Over the past years, significant effort has been put into understanding dislocation behavior across different length scales via experimental characterization techniques and simulations. This paper introduces the dislocation ontology (DISO), which defines the concepts and relationships related to linear defects in crystalline materials. We developed DISO using a top-down approach in which we start defining the most general concepts in the dislocation domain and subsequent specialization of them. DISO is published through a persistent URL following W3C best practices for publishing Linked Data. Two potential use cases for DISO are presented to illustrate its usefulness in the dislocation dynamics domain. The evaluation of the ontology is performed in two directions, evaluating the success of the ontology in modeling a real-world domain and the richness of the ontology.", "authors": "Ahmad Zainul Ihsan, Said Fathalla, Stefan Sandfeld", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},

For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA. Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio description of the material's electronic structure determines both aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometry Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$, including $X = $ Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal $\\mathrm{L}1_0$ order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted MCA.", "authors": "Christopher D.

A critical examination of the authors' claim of having performed fitting of experimental data to the model reveals that, in fact, the authors conducted simulations where all free parameters were fixed.

State space truncation -- the restriction of the observations to a subset of state space with prescribed probability -- is introduced to obtain that result. Two stochastic processes undergoing first-order phase transitions are analyzed both analytically and numerically: the Ehrenfest urn model and the 2D Ising model subject to a magnetic field. In presence of phase transitions, we prove that even minimal state space truncation makes averages of exponentials of path dependent variables sensibly deviate from full state space values. Specifically, in the case of discontinuous phase transitions, this approach is strikingly effective in locating the critical transition value of the control parameter. As this approach works even with variables different from those of fluctuation theorems, it provides a new recipe to identify order parameters in the study of nonequilibrium phase transitions, profiting from the often incomplete statistics that are available.", "authors": "Matteo Colangeli, Antonio Di Francesco, Lamberto Rondoni", "date": "5 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Stiffer alginate gels deposit more efficiently in microchannel flows", "abstract": "The behavior of crosslinking polymer solutions as they transition from liquid-like to solid-like material in flow determines success or failure in several applications, from 3D printing to oil recovery in the earth's subsurface to a wide variety of biological flows. Dilute polymer solutions flow easily, while concentrated polymers or crosslinked polymer gels can clog pores, nozzles, or channels. We have recently uncovered and described a third regime of flow dynamics in polymers that occurs when crosslinking happens during flow: intermittent flows. In a model system of alginate and calcium meeting at a Y-shaped junction in a microfluidic channel, a persistent and regular pattern of intermittent flow occurs when driven at a constant volume flow rate. At the junction, calcium crosslinks alginate to form an alginate gel, which subsequently deposits on the channel wall. As gel continues to deposit, it obstructs the channel, causing the driving pressure to increase to maintain a constant flow rate. At a critical pressure, corresponding to a critical shear stress, the fluid pulls the gel from the wall, removing the gel from the device and resulting in a clear channel. The gel deposit begins again, and the process then repeats as long as flow continues. Chemical concentrations and flow rate control both the frequency of ablation and the critical shear stress. In this work, we provide an analytical framework to quantitatively describe the intermittent behavior as a result of diffusively driven deposition in a high Peclet number flow where convection dominates. Fitting the experimental data to the model allows estimation of the deposition efficiency, or the fraction of flowing material that sticks to the channel walls. By correlating the results of the model with bulk rheology measurements, we find that deposition efficiency increases with the stiffness of the gel formed in flow.", "authors": "Barrett T Smith, Sara M Hashmi", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},

We analyze in particular the dependence of the ground state dipole configuration on the width of the Möbius strip and highlight two crossovers in the ground state that can be correspondingly tuned.

We record photoluminescence and reflection spectra at interlayer distances between 0.5 nm and 5.8 nm (0-16 hBN layers). We find that the energy transfer is dominated by states outside the light cone, indicative of a Förster transfer process, with an additional contribution from a Dexter process at 0.5 nm interlayer distance. We find that the measured dependence of the luminescence intensity on interlayer distances above 1 nm can be quantitatively described using recently reported values of the Förster transfer rates of thermalized charge carriers. At smaller interlayer distances, the experimentally observed transfer rates exceed the predictions and furthermore depend on excess energy as well as on excitation density. Since the transfer probability of the Förster mechanism depends on the momentum of electron-hole pairs, we conclude that at these distances, the transfer is driven by non-thermalized charge carrier distributions.", "authors": "David Tebbe, Marc Schütte, K.

Because this result is classically exact, it is general: It is as valid, theoretically, for a liquid or a molecule in a non-thermal non-stationary state as it is for a crystal at thermal equilibrium at a low temperature. Therefore, as well as being of fundamental importance to physical theory, this result implies that calculating the FT of the mVVCF from atomistic simulations is a much more powerful computational tool than it is believed to be.

Here, we tackle this problem by first constructing high-dimensional neural network diabatic potentials including state crossings determined by constrained density functional theory, then applying mixed quantum-classical surface hopping simulations to evolve coupled electron-nuclear motion. Our approach accurately describes the nonadiabatic effects in CO scattering from Au(111) without empirical parameters and yields results agreeing well with experiments under various conditions for this benchmark system. We find that both adiabatic and nonadiabatic energy loss channels have important contributions to the vibrational relaxation of highly vibrationally excited CO(vi = 17), whereas relaxation of low vibrationally excited states of CO(vi = 2) is weak and dominated by nonadiabatic energy loss.

These chiral edge channels conduct dissipationless transport in QAH insulators, making them pivotal for applications in low-consumption electronics and topological quantum computing. While the QAH effect with multiple chiral edge channels (i.e., C >1) has been demonstrated in multilayers consisting of magnetic topological insulators and normal insulators, the channel number remains fixed for a given sample. Here, we unveil the tunability of the number of chiral edge channels within a single QAH insulator device. By tuning the magnetization of individual layers within the multilayer system, Chern insulating states with different Chern numbers are unveiled. The tunable Chern number was corroborated by our theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we conducted layer-dependent calculations to elucidate the contribution of the Chern number from different layers in the multilayer.

At $T=2$ K and in $B=14$ T for both compounds, magnetoresistance reaches the order of magnitude of $10^4\\%$. For both materials, standard Kohler's rule is obeyed only in the temperature range from 50 K to 300 K. At lower temperatures, extended Kohler's rule has to be invoked because carrier concentrations and mobilities strongly change with temperature and magnetic field. This is further proven by the observation of a quite rare temperature-dependence of oscillation frequencies in Shubnikov-de Haas effect. Rate of this dependence clearly changes at Néel temperature, reminiscent of a novel magnetic band splitting. Multi-frequency character of the observed Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations points to the coexistence of electron- and hole-type Fermi pockets in both studied materials.

In these materials the anisotropic local crystal environment of the different sublattices lowers the symmetry of the system so that the opposite-spin sublattices are connected only by rotations, which results in an unconventional spin-polarized band structure in the momentum space. This low symmetry of the crystal structure is expected to be reflected in the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we study the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of Mn$_5$Si$_3$, an altermagnetic candidate material. We first demonstrate a change in the relative Néel vector orientation when rotating the external field orientation through systematic changes in both the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic longitudinal magnetoresistance. We then show that the anomalous Hall effect in this material is anisotropic with the Néel vector orientation relative to the crystal structure and that this anisotropy requires high crystal quality and unlikely correlates with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

The double stranded hairpin is connected to a heat bath at temperature $T$ and subject to an external force $f$, which couples to the free length $L$ of the unzipped sequence. Increasing the force, leads to an zipping/unzipping first-order phase transition at a critical force $f_c(T)$ in the thermodynamic limit of a very large chain. We compute analytically, as a function of temperature $T$ and force $f$, the full distribution $P(L)$ of free lengths in the thermodynamic limit and show that it is qualitatively very different for $f<f_c$, $f=f_c$ and $f>f_c$. Next we consider quasistatic work processes where the force is incremented according to a linear protocol. Having obtained $P(L)$ already allows us to derive an analytical expression for the work distribution $P(W)$ in the zipped phase $f<f_c$ for a long chain. We compute the large-deviation tails of the work distribution explicitly.

We find that if an impurity corresponds to varying a nonzero matrix element of the lattice Hamiltonian, regardless the element represents hopping, chemical potential, pairing, etc, then the average topological marker is conserved. However, if there are many strong impurities and the average distance between them is shorter than a correlation length, then the average marker is no longer conserved. In addition, strong and dense impurities can be used to continuously interpolate between one topological phase and another.

The lower collective modes is from the usual gauge symmetry breaking and has a larger speed than the one in the negative direction of $p$. The higher one is due to the direction spontaneous symmetry breaking of centre-of-mass momentum $p$, and separates two kinds of single-particle excitations in the positive $p$ direction. However, this higher mode disappears in the opposite direction of $p$, where two single-particle excitations overlap with each other.

However, in this study, we have made a noteworthy observation: although the electron-phonon coupling alone is insufficient to account for the observed ARPES pattern, our analysis reveals that when the instantaneous electron-phonon coupling occurring in selective phonon channel is enhanced by the coexistence of antiferromagnetic spin density wave and charge density wave phenomena, the amplified interaction becomes comparable to the ARPES range. This finding suggests that the instantaneous interplay between these intricate phenomena should play a crucial role in generating the observed energy range in ARPES.

Here, we show that modifying Boltzmann's entropy via a relative energy tolerance eliminates thermodynamic inconsistencies in several model systems with unbounded energy spectra by ensuring positive, finite temperatures. Concomitantly, the proposed entropy allows for negative temperatures in systems with bounded spectra and closely matches canonical ensemble predictions.

Surprisingly, our investigation reveals weak effects of phonon-electron interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of n-type GaN at ultra-high electron concentrations, and the impact of the Fröhlich interaction can be ignored. The small phonon-electron scattering rate is attributed to the limited scattering channels, quantified by the Fermi surface nesting function. In contrast, there is a significant reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of p-type GaN at high hole concentrations due to the large Fermi surface nesting function. However, as p-type GaN has relatively smaller electron-phonon matrix elements, the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity is weaker than that observed in p-type silicon.

Furthermore, our research reveals limitations in the conventional mean-field ab-initio approximation used for antiferromagnetic fluctuations in YBCO. It shows that the dynamic behavior of electrons in YBCO might not be accurately captured by this approximation, as non-uniform magnetic fields under antiferromagnetic fluctuations induce an additional electric potential on electrons across the boundary between non-magnetic to magnetic sites instantaneously.

We use such models to predict relevant quantities including ionization potentials, electron affinities, and IU-based band offsets. We establish simple rules using the above models to pre-screen potential semiconductor devices from a vast pool of nearly 1.4 trillion candidate interfaces.", "authors": "Kamal Choudhary, Kevin Garrity", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Truncated string-state-space approach and its application to non-integrable spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain", "abstract": "By circumventing the difficulty of obtaining exact string state solutions to Bethe ansatz equations, we devise a truncated string-state-space approach for investigating spin dynamics in non-integrable spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain subjected to staggered field at various magnetization. The obtained dynamical spectra reveal a series of elastic peaks at integer multiples of the ordering wavevector $Q$, indicating the presence of multi-$Q$ Bethe string states within the ground state. The spectrum exhibits a separation between different string continua as the strength of the staggered field increases at low magnetization,reflecting the confinement of the Bethe strings. The approach has successfully provided a unified string-state-based picture for understanding spin dynamics observed in various phases of quasi-1D antiferromagnet $\\rm YbAlO_3$ \\cite{Yang_CBS_2023}, and also paves a way for investigating low-dimensional non-integrable systems.", "authors": "Jiahao Yang, Jianda Wu", "date": "4 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Conservation, correlations, and diagrammatic completeness", "abstract": "The diagrammatic theory of strongly correlated systems includes two types of selfconsistent perturbative analysis: Phi derivability, or conserving approximations, and iterative parquet theory. Becker and Grosser [W. Becker and D. Grosser, Nuov. Cim. A 10, 343 (1972)] first showed that crossing symmetry and elastic unitarity (conservation) could not both be satisfied in any approximation to the two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equation for the transition matrix. Jackson and Smith [A. D. Jackson and R. A. Smith, Phys. Rev. A 36, 2517 (1987)] later proved in particular that, despite their close affinity, Phi derivability and parquet are fundamentally irreconcilable. Parquet theory computes the two-body scattering amplitude, respecting its crossing symmetry. Phi derivability computes the nonequilibrium one-body dynamics, respecting conservation in the two-body response. Parquet cannot safeguard conservation and Phi derivability cannot guarantee crossing symmetry, yet both are physical requirements. We investigate these ``failure modes'' within a generalized Hamiltonian approach. The two methods' respective relation to the exact ground state sheds light on their complementary shortcomings.", "authors": "Frederick Green", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "HEOM-QUICK2: a general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body open quantum systems -- An Update", "abstract": "Many-body open quantum systems (OQS) have a profound impact on various subdisciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus, the development of a computer program capable of accurately, efficiently, and versatilely simulating many-body OQS is highly desirable. In recent years, we have focused on the advancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach allows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations, non-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These efforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to the best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program features more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment of non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time dissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2 has become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic many-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions. Furthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables accurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin relaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through several examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under non-equilibrium conditions. Thus, the new HEOM-QUICK2 program offers a powerful and comprehensive tool for studying many-body OQS with exotic quantum phenomena and exploring applications in various disciplines.", "authors": "Daochi Zhang, Lyuzhou Ye, Jiaan Cao, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu, Xiao Zheng, YiJing Yan", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Exotic magnetization curves in classical square-kagomé spin lattices", "abstract": "Classical spin systems with non-coplanar ground states typically exhibit nonlinear magnetization curves characterized by kinks and jumps. Our article briefly summarizes the most important related analytical results. In a comprehensive case study, we then address AF-square kagomé and AF/FM-square kagomé spin lattices equipped with additional cross-plaquette interactions. It is known that these systems have non-coplanar ground states that assume a cuboctahedral structure in the absence of a magnetic field. When a magnetic field $H$ is switched on, a rich variety of different phases develops from the cuboctahedral ground state, which are studied in their dependence on $H$ and a cross-plaquette coupling constant $J_3>0$. For the AF square-kagomé spin lattice, we carefully identify and describe seven phases that appear in a phase diagram with five triple points. The transitions between these phases are predominantly discontinuous, although two cases exhibit continuous transitions. In contrast, the phase diagram of the AF/FM square-kagomé model shows only four phases with a single triple point, but these also lead to exotic magnetization curves. Here, too, there are two types of phase boundaries belonging to continuous and discontinuous transitions.", "authors": "Heinz-Jürgen Schmidt, Johannes Richter", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Bulk synthesis of Zn$_3$WN$_4$ via solid-state metathesis", "abstract": "Ternary nitrides are of growing technological importance, with applications as semiconductors, catalysts, and magnetic materials; however, new synthetic tools are needed to advance materials discovery efforts. Here, we show that Zn$_3$WN$_4$ can be synthesized via metathesis reactions between Li$_6$WN$_4$ and Zn$X_2$ ($X$ = Br, Cl, F). In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry show that the reaction onset is correlated with the Zn$X_2$ melting point and that product purity is inversely correlated with the reaction's exothermicity. High resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measurements show that this bulk synthesis produces a structure with substantial cation ordering, as opposed to the disordered structure initially discovered via thin film sputtering. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy reveals that Zn$_3$WN$_4$ powders exhibit two optical absorption onsets at 2.5 eV and 4.0 eV, indicating wide-bandgap semiconducting behavior and suggesting a small amount of structural disorder. We hypothesize that this synthesis strategy is generalizable because many potential Li-$M$-N precursors (where $M$ is a metal) are available for synthesizing new ternary nitride materials. This work introduces a promising synthesis strategy that will accelerate the discovery of novel functional ternary nitrides and other currently inaccessible materials.", "authors": "Christopher L.

{"title": "Minimal Model for Chirally Induced Spin Selectivity: Spin-orbit coupling, tunneling and decoherence", "abstract": "Chirally Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) is a transport phenomenon observed in both linear and non-linear regimes, where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) acts as the key driver and electron tunneling serves as the dominant mechanism for charge transfer. Despite SOC's inherent time-reversal symmetry (TRS) preservation, conventional reciprocity relations limit spin polarization and the differential treatment of spin species. In experimental systems, an additional factor, spin-independent decoherence, disrupts TRS and reciprocity. We introduce decoherence using the Buttiker voltage probe within the scattering matrix framework. Our results reveal the importance of under-the-barrier decoherence as an order-of-magnitude polarization enhancement mechanism. Polarization arises by the disruption of spin precession around the spin-orbit magnetic field with a new spin component along the field direction. The alignment of polarization depends on interference effects produced by the voltage probe. We discuss the connection of our model to a more realistic decoherence mechanism in molecular systems.", "authors": "Miguel Mena, Bertrand Berche, Ernesto Medina", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

Its lattice dynamics exhibits characteristics of a phonon liquid: mode coupling, low lifetimes and `rattlers'. To study the thermal conduction in this crystal, including the effect of dynamic disorder introduced by the Cs rattlers, we apply large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with machine-learning interatomic potentials. We simulate its ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity in the cubic phase and obtain phonon spectra by measuring velocity autocorrelation functions. The thermal conductivity at 500 K is computed to be $0.53\\pm0.04\\frac{\\rm W}{\\rm m K}$, which is similar to that of demineralized water under normal indoor conditions. MD based insight into the heat transport mechanism of halide perovskites is presented. In the analysis the Cs cations are interpreted as damped Einstein oscillators. The phonon bandstructure of a system with artificially raised Cs masses demonstrates an increased interference of the Cs rattling with the acoustic phonon modes. We show that the thermal conductivity of the CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite can still be slightly decreased by tuning the cation rattling frequency into the range of the low lying acoustic mode", "authors": "Jonathan Lahnsteiner, Max Rang, Menno Bokdam", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},
{"title": "Microscopic Origin of Chiral Charge Density Wave in TiSe2", "abstract": "Chiral charge density wave (CDW) is widely observed in low dimensional systems to be entangled with various emerging phases but its microscopic origin has been elusive. We reinvestigate the representative but debated chiral CDW of TiSe$_{2}$ using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our STM data reveal unambiguously the chiral distortion of the topmost Se layer in domains of opposite chirality, which are interfaced with a novel domain wall. DFT calculations find the atomic structure of the chiral CDW, which has a $C2$ symmetry with the inversion and reflection symmetry broken. The chirality is determined by the helicity of Se-Ti bond distortions and their translation between neighboring layers. The present structure reproduces well the STM images with lower energy than the prevailing non-chiral $P\\bar{3}c1$ structure model. Our result provides the atomistic understanding of the CDW chirality in TiSe$_{2}$, which can be referred to in a wide class of monolayer and layered materials with CDW.", "authors": "Hyeonjung Kim, Kyung-Hwan Jin, Han Woong Yeom", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

Although chemical vapor deposition can achieve wafer-scale growth of 2D TMDs, a comprehensive theoretical framework for effective growth optimization is lacking. Atomistic modeling methods offer a promising approach to delve into the intricate dynamics underlying the growth. In this study, we employ kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to identify crucial parameters that govern the morphology of MoS2 flakes grown on diverse substrates. Our simulations reveal that large adsorption rates significantly enhance growth speed, which however necessitates rapid edge migration to achieve compact triangles. Substrate etching can tune the adsorption-desorption process of adatoms and enable preferential growth within a specific substrate region, controlling the flake morphology. This study unravels the complex dynamics governing 2D TMD morphology, offering a theoretical framework for decision-making in the design and optimization of TMD synthesis processes.", "authors": "Samuel Aldana, Ion Spiridon, Lulin Wang, Hongzhou Zhang", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

After laying down our theoretical approach in particular discussing how to compute charge and spin bond currents, DFT+NEGF calculations are carried out for ideal clean systems. In these the transport is ballistic and the linear response limit is met. The SHE emerges in a central region attached to two leads when we apply a bias voltage so that electrons are accelerated by a uniform electric field. As a result, we obtain a finite spin-Hall current and, by performing a scaling analysis with respect to the system size, we estimate the ballistic spin Hall conductivity (SHC). We consider 5d metals with fcc and bcc crystal structures, finding that the SHC exhibits a rough qualitative dependence on the d-band filling, and comment on these results in relation to existing literature. Finally, within the same DFT+NEGF approach, we also predict the appearance of a current-induced spin dipole moment inside the materials' unit cell and estimate its magnitude.", "authors": "Akash Bajaj, Reena Gupta, Ilya V.

Here, we report results of confocal fluorescence microscopy where simultaneous recording of translational and rotational particle trajectories from a bidisperse colloidal dispersion is achieved by spiking the samples with rotational probe particles. The latter consist of colloidal particles containing two fluorescently labelled cores suited for tracking the particle's orientation. A comparison of the experimental data with event driven Brownian simulations gives insight into the system's structure and dynamics close to the glass transition and sheds new light onto the translation-rotation coupling. The data show that with increasing volume fractions, translational dynamics slows down drastically, whereas rotational dynamics changes very little. We find convincing agreement between simulation and experiments, even though the simulations neglect far-field hydrodynamic interactions. An additional analysis of the glass transition following mode coupling theory works well for the structural dynamics but indicates a decoupling of the diffusion of the smaller particle species. The shear stress correlations do not decorrelate in the simulated glass states and are not affected by rotational motion.", "authors": "John Geiger, Niklas Grimm, Matthis Fuchs, Andreas Zumbusch", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

{"title": "Observation of Liquid Glass in Molecular Dynamics Simulations", "abstract": "Molecular anisotropy plays an important role in the glass transition of a liquid. Recently, a novel glass state has been discovered by optical microscopy experiments on suspensions of ellipsoidal colloids. 'Liquid glass' is a disordered analog of a nematic liquid crystal, where rotation motion is hindered but particles diffuse freely. Global nematic order is suppressed as clusters of aligned particles intertwine. We perform Brownian dynamics simulations to test the structure and dynamics of a dense system of soft ellipsoidal particles. As seen in experiments and in accordance with predictions from mode coupling theory, on the time scale of our simulations rotation motion is frozen but translation motion persists in liquid glass. Analyses of the dynamic structure functions for translation and rotation corroborates the presence of two separate glass transitions for rotation and translation, respectively. Even though the equilibrium state should be a nematic, aligned structures remain small and orientational order rapidly decays with increasing size. Long-wavelength fluctuations are remnants of the isotropic-nematic transition.", "authors": "Mohammed Alhissi, Andreas Zumbusch, Matthias Fuchs", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},

For an example of the liner advection, we consider the $O(n)$ model in the steady shear. Our scaling analysis reveals that the model can undergo the continuous symmetry breaking even in $d=2$ and, moreover, predicts the upper critical dimension $d_{\\rm up}=2$. These results are fully consistent with a recent numerical simulation of the $O(2)$ model, where the authors reported a continuous symmetry breaking characterized by the mean-field critical exponents in $d=2$. For an example of the non-linear advection, we consider Toner and Tu model, which was introduced to explain the polar-ordered flocks observed, for instance, in the Vicsek model in $d=2$. Our simple scaling argument reproduces the previous results by the dynamical renormalization theory. We furthermore discuss the effects of the additional non-linear terms discovered by the recent re-analysis of the hydrodynamic equation of the polar-ordered flocks. Our scaling argument predicts that the additional non-linear terms modify the scaling exponents and, in particular, recover the isotropic scaling behavior reported in the previous numerical simulation of the Vicsek model.", "authors": "Harukuni Ikeda", "date": "3 Jan 2024"},
